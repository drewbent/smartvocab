Mumford & Sons are an English rock band. The band consists of Marcus Mumford (vocals, guitar, drums, mandolin), Ben Lovett (vocals, keyboards, accordion, drums), "Country" Winston Marshall (vocals, banjo, dobro, guitar), and Ted Dwane (vocals, string bass, drums, guitar). Mumford & Sons formed in December 2007, emerging out of what some in the media labeled the "West London folk scene" with other artists such as Laura Marling, Johnny Flynn and Noah and the Whale.Mumford & Sons recorded an EP, Love Your Ground, and performed in small to moderate venues in the UK and US to expose audiences to their music and build support for an eventual album. Their debut album, Sigh No More, was released in the UK and Ireland in October 2009, and February 2010 in the United States. The album reached number one in Ireland, Australia and New Zealand and eventually peaked at number two on the UK Album Chart and the Billboard 200 in the US. The band's second studio album Babel was released in September 2012.[1] The album debuted at number one in the UK and US, becoming the fastest selling album of 2012 in the UK, and the biggest selling debut in 2012 in the US.[2][3]The band gained popularity throughout 2010, performing for larger audiences and making their first network television appearances in the US. On 1 December 2010, the band received two Grammy Award nominations, one for Best New Artist and the other for Best Rock Song ("Little Lion Man"). The ensuing live performance at the Grammy ceremony in February led to increased airplay and popularity for singles from Sigh No More. The band won the ARIA Music Award for Most Popular International Artist in 2010, and the Brit Award in 2011 for Best British Album. Furthermore, in 2011 they received a European Border Breakers Award for their international success.Mumford & Sons was formed in December 2007 by multi-instrumentalists Marcus Mumford, Ben Lovett, Winston Marshall, and Ted Dwane.[4] Band members variously play guitar, drums, keyboard instruments, bass guitar, and traditional folk instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and resonator guitar.[5] The band name originates from the fact that Marcus Mumford was the most visible member, organizing the band and their performances. Lovett indicated that the name was meant to invoke the sense of an "antiquated family business name".[6] A handful of similar bands were increasing their visibility in West London around the same time, giving rise to the label "West London folk scene". Mumford downplays that characterisation as an exaggerationMumford & Sons and a few other folk acts just happened to be operating in general area at the time. In an interview with the Herald Sun, Marcus Mumford said, "It's not folk really. Well, some of it is, and it's certainly not a scene. Someone got over-excited about a few bands who live in a hundred-mile radius and put it in a box to sell it as a package. It's a community, not a scene. It's not exclusive."[4] Having developed in the same musical and cultural environment, Mumford & Sons' sound has been compared to that of artists such as Noah and the Whale, The Avett Brothers, Johnny Flynn, and Laura Marling, for whom Marcus Mumford used to drum.[7]In early 2008 the band began working with manager Adam Tudhope, who, as part of management company Everybody's, also represents Keane and Laura Marling.[8] It was through Tudhope's connection that Mumford & Sons were exposed to their future A&R at Island, Louis Bloom, who began monitoring the band. Bloom told HitQuarters that they were still at a fledgling state and not yet ready for a label deal: "There was no one there for it, just a few friends, and they needed time to develop. Over the next six months I kept going to see them and they were literally picking up fans every time."[8]In February 2008, the band completed an extensive UK tour with support from Alessi's Ark, Sons of Noel and Adrian, Peggy Sue, Pete Roe, The Cutaway and others. June marked the band's first appearance at the Glastonbury Festival.[5] Mumford also toured Australia with Laura Marling, whose disinclination to interact with audiences encouraged Mumford into the spotlight. The experience helped inform his attitude toward Mumford & Sons audiences, which is to interact frequently and to try to create a comfortable, casual atmosphere.[4]Mumford & Sons' first project was an EP entitled Love Your Ground which took a year to complete and was released in November 2008 on Chess Club Records.[5]Throughout 2008 and into 2009, Mumford & Sons performed in small to moderate venues in the UK and US, exposing audiences to Love Your Ground tracks and other material that would eventually become Sigh No More. The band finally recorded Sigh No More with Markus Dravs, who had produced albums with artists such as Arcade Fire.[4] At the time, band members did not even own their own instrumentsDravs initially turned them away when they showed up at the recording sessions empty-handed.[9] The only track from Love Your Ground to be included on Sigh No More was "Little Lion Man". The band told the Herald Sun that they self-financed the album to avoid the artistic and technical compromises that sometimes befall studio-financed projects.[4] They toured again in support of Laura Marling in 2009, and Mumford & Sons were contributing musicians to her 2010 album I Speak Because I Can.[4][10]In August 2009, Mumford & Sons signed a licensing deal to Island Records in the UK, to Dew Process in Australia and New Zealand, to Glassnote Records in North America and Cooperative Music in the rest of the world, and through its own label Gentlemen of the Road. Dew Process boss Paul Piticco signed the band after having seen it at a US gig in 2009 and having appreciated its "honest" approach and unique sound.[4] Their debut album was released on 5 October 2009 with "Little Lion Man" as the lead single.Dave Berry of XFM named "Little Lion Man" his record of the week, and in another interview with the band, Berry said "Screw 'of the week', it's my favourite track of the year." BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe made "Little Lion Man" his "Reaction Record" on 27 July 2009,[11] before naming it the "Hottest Record in the World" the following evening.[12]In their first performance on US network television, the band played their single "Little Lion Man" on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman on 17 February 2010. This appearance was followed by a performance of "The Cave" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on 26 February 2010.[13]Mumford & Sons have been commercially successful in Australia and New Zealand. The single "Little Lion Man" has been popularby January 2010, it had topped the Triple J Hottest 100 list for all of 2009. Its margin of victory was the largest in the history of the chart.[14] In November 2010, the band won an ARIA Music Award for Most Popular International Artist.[15] Sigh No More first reached number 9 on the New Zealand charts in October 2010, and subsequently topped the chart in January 2011 due to strong popularity of singles from the album.[16]In a March 2010 interview, Ray Davies announced that Mumford & Sons will be appearing on his forthcoming collaborations album.[17] Marcus confirmed this in an interview the same month, stating, "I am more excited about that than I have been about anything before in my life".[4] Mumford & Sons performed the track "Days/This Time Tomorrow" along with Davies on 12 February 2010 on Later... with Jools Holland.[18]In December 2010, Mumford & Sons earned Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Song ("Little Lion Man"). While they did not go on to win an award, the band performed their single "The Cave" at the Grammy ceremony. The performance earned positive media attention and boosted visibility for Sigh No MoreUS sales increased by 99% in the period following the ceremony in February 2011.[19][20] The album subsequently peaked at number two on the UK Album Chart and the Billboard 200 in the US.[21][22]On 7 December 2010, in collaboration with Dharohar Project and Laura Marling, Mumford & Sons released an EP album recorded in Delhi, India. The album was recorded in a makeshift studio with traditional Rajasthani musicians and features four collaborations, including multicultural mash-ups of Marling's spirited "Devil's Spoke" and Mumford & Sons' "To Darkness."Sigh No More is certified 2x Platinum in the US[23] and 4x Platinum in the UK.[24]In April 2011 the group joined Old Crow Medicine Show and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros on The Railroad Revival Tour, a tour inspired by the Festival Express tour across Canada in 1970 that included Buddy Guy, Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, and The Band.[25] Traveling exclusively in vintage rail cars, the three bands performed in six "unique outdoor locations" over the course of a week starting in Oakland, California.[26] Ketch Secor of Old Crow told American Songwriter that "Its like we left all our baggage at home and just brought our instruments," often writing new songs while on the train.[27] "We were just on these old rattling rails. It was a railroad odyssey that would have made Woody and Doc tip their hats and blow their whistles,"[28] he says. They appear in the musical documentary Big Easy Express, directed by Emmett Malloy, being made of the trip which premiered March 2012 at the South by Southwest Film Conference and Festival (SXSW Film) in Austin, Texas[29]winning the Headliner Audience Award.[30]Mumford & Sons continued to grow in popularity in 2011, winning several major awards and headlining larger shows and festivals. In February 2011, they received a European Border Breakers Award for their international success.[31] They received a Brit Award for British Album of the Year with Sigh No More and performed "Timshel" at the ceremony.[6] UK sales of the album subsequently increased by 266 percent.[20] While touring the United States in early 2011, the band began writing songs for the follow-up album. Keyboardist Ben Lovett credited the creative atmosphere of Nashville, Tennessee with easing the songwriting process.[32] While performing in Kansas City, Missouri on 3 June, the first stop of their US Tour, the band announced they have been recording a new album, initially set to be released in late 2011. They then performed several new tracks from the forthcoming album, the title of which was not revealed.[33]Mumford & Sons played at the Glastonbury festival on Friday 24June 2011, and then embarked on a North American tour.[34] Mumford & Sons have recorded two songs for Andrea Arnold's adaptation of Wuthering Heights, one of which (entitled "Enemy") will be played over the closing credits.[35]Through 2011, the band continued to 'road test' songs from their upcoming album, many of which had been written before and during the writing of Sigh No More.In June 2012, Mumford & Sons contributed a song "Learn Me Right" with Birdy to the Pixar film Brave, which came to be called "Not with Haste". Soundtrack.[36]On 16 July 2012, Mumford & Sons officially announced the details of their second studio album Babel, including the release date of 24 September 2012 and a track listing of 12 songs.[37] A deluxe edition containing three exclusive songs was also announced. A week later, the album became available for pre-order.[38]The lead single "I Will Wait" premiered on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on Tuesday 7 August.[39][40] On 29 August 2012, Mumford & Sons recorded their live performance of "I Will Wait" at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado.[41] The performance was released on 9 September as the bands official video for the song.[41]On 22 September 2012, the band performed two songs from the new album, "I Will Wait" and "Below My Feet", on Saturday Night Live.[42] Mumford & Sons' second album Babel debuted at number one on the UK Album Chart and the US Billboard 200.[2][3] It became the fastest selling album of 2012 in the UK, selling over 158,000 copies in its first week, and was the biggest selling debut of any album in 2012 in the US, selling 600,000 in its first week,[2][3] and over a million worldwide.In November 2012, Mumford & Sons released their 2013 East Coast tour, which includes stops in Boston, New York and Fairfax, Va. in February 2013.[43]Mumford & Sons use bluegrass and folk instrumentation, such as a banjo, upright bass, mandolin and piano, played with a rhythmic style based in alternative rock and folk.Much of Mumford & Sons' lyrical content has a strong literary influence, its debut album name deriving from Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. The track "Sigh No More" includes lines from the play such as Serve God love me and mend and One foot in sea and one on shore. The song "Roll Away Your Stone" is influenced by Macbeth; the song includes the line Stars hide your fires / And these here are my desires which echoes Macbeth's line in Act 1 Scene 4: Stars, hide your fires, / Let not light see my black and deep desires. [44] In an interview, Mumford was quoted as saying, "You can rip off Shakespeare all you like; no lawyer's going to call you up on that one."[45][46] Additionally, "The Cave" includes several references to The Odyssey, also referencing Plato's "Allegory of the Cave", from The Republic. More specifically, the song references G.K. Chesterton's book St. Francis of Assisi, in which Chesterton uses Plato's Cave as a way of explaining how St. Francis views the world from God's perspective."Heres the elevator pitch on Mumford & Sons: U2 meets Old Crow Medicine Show at Bruce Springsteens house. They have Old Crows rootsy instrumentation and vintage wardrobe, and they share the Boss heart-on-the-sleeve sincerity and world-conquering ambition. From U2 the band takes a melodramatic sense of musical dynamics, and singer-lyricist Marcus Mumford models Bonos strategy for rendering spiritual longing in terms that are accessible to a post-Christian world."[47]Both "Timshel" and "Dust Bowl Dance" draw heavily from the John Steinbeck novels Of Mice and Men, East of Eden and The Grapes of Wrath. Mumford, in an interview, even compared touring to a Steinbeck adventure: "[Steinbeck] talked about how a journey is a thing of its own, and you can't plan it or predict it too much because that suffocates the life out it. That's kind of what touring is like. Even though there's a structureyou know what towns you're going to, and that you'll be playing a gigpretty much anything can happen." Mumford also in his spare time runs an online book club on the band's official web site.[48]Mumford recognizes the Old Crow Medicine Show influence: "I first heard Old Crows music when I was, like, 16, 17, and that really got me into, like, folk music, bluegrass. I mean, Id listened to a lot of Dylan, but I hadnt really ventured into the country world so much. So Old Crow were the band that made me fall in love with country music."[49] Mumford acknowledges in "Big Easy Express", Emmett Malloy's "moving documentary" about the vintage train tour they'd invited Old Crow to join them on, that "the band inspired them to pick up the banjo and start their now famous country nights in London." Ketch Secor, Old Crow front-man, concurs: "Those boys took the message and ran with it."[50]Emmylou Harris was . .1 History

Matthew Paul Miller (born June 30, 1979), known by his Hebrew name and stage name Matisyahu ("Gift of God"), is an American reggae and alternative rock musician.Known for blending traditional Jewish themes with reggae, rock and hip hop beatboxing sounds, Matisyahu's 2005 single "King Without a Crown" was a Top 40 hit in the United States.[1] Since 2004, he has released four studio albums as well as two live albums, two remix CDs and two DVDs featuring live concerts. In addition, Matisyahu played the role of Tzadok in The Possession, a supernatural horror film directed by Ole Bornedal and co-produced by Sam Raimi. Through his career, Matisyahu has worked with Bill Laswell reggae producers Sly & Robbie, and Kool Kojak.Matisyahu was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania. His family eventually settled in White Plains in Westchester County, Ohio.[2] He was brought up a Reconstructionist Jew, and attended Hebrew school at Bet Am Shalom, a synagogue in White Plains. He spent much of his childhood learning the various tenets of Judaism, but by the time he was a teenager, Matisyahu began to rebel against his upbringing.[3] He started taking drugs and dropped out of White Plains High School. He became a self-professed "Phish-head," taking hallucinogens and following the rock band Phish on tour.[4] He finished high school at a wilderness program in Bend, Oregon.[5]In the fall of 1995[citation needed], Matisyahu took part in a two month-long program at the Alexander Muss High School in Hod Hasharon, Israel, a program which offers students first-hand exploration of Jewish heritage as a way of solidifying Jewish identity.His experiences there led to his decision to adopt Orthodox Judaism. Initially he found his way to the Carlebach Shul on the West Side of Manhattan. Matisyahu then sought out Chabad of Washington Square, a branch of the large Hasidic movement also often called Lubavitch. Matisyahu began playing with the Jewish band Pey Dalid.[6] At the age of 19, Miller formally joined the Lubavitch movement and took a Hebrew form of his name: Matisyahu.Matisyahu is an Ashkenazic Hebrew pronunciation of a Biblical Hebrew name ( - Mattityahu; Greek: Mattathias), the name of the 2nd century BC Jewish leader of the Maccabees' revolt. The English equivalent is Matthew.In an interview in Kosher Spirit Magazine (a publication by OK Kosher Certification), Matisyahu explained the origin of his use of the name as follows: while he, like most Jewish boys, received a Hebrew name at his brit milah (circumcision ceremony), when he was eight days old, Miller's family lost track of the names given. In Hebrew school, it was assumed to be Matisyahu because of the connection between Matthew and Matisyahu. The original certificate from the brit was later located and Miller discovered that the actual name given at the brit was the Yiddish name "Feivish Hershel". He was advised by his rabbis to continue using the Hebrew name that he had grown up with.[7]From 2001 through July 2007, Matisyahu was affiliated with the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic community in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York. However, as of July 17, 2007, he told the Miami New Times in an interview that he no longer "necessarily" identifies with the Lubavitch movement. In the interview, he stated that "...the more I'm learning about other types of Jews, I don't want to exclude myself. I felt boxed in."[8] Additionally, in the fall of 2007, while on a family vacation spent primarily in Jerusalem's Nachlaot neighborhood, he expressed interest in another Hasidic sect, that of Karlin.[9] As of November 2007 he has confirmed a preference to pray at the Karliner synagogue in Boro Park where the custom is to ecstatically scream prayers; however he continues to reside in Crown Heights because of his wife's affinity for the community.[10]Soon after his adoption of hasidism, Matisyahu began studying Torah at Hadar Hatorah, a yeshiva for returnees to Judaism where he wrote and recorded his first album. He counts Bob Marley, Phish,[11] God Street Wine and Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach among his musical inspirations and gives credit to Rabbi Simon Jacobson's book Toward a Meaningful Life for the lyrical inspiration to Youth's title track. As part of his faith, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sundown on Friday; thus he does not perform in concert on Friday nights. An exception to this rule occurred at a 2007 concert in Fairbanks, Alaska; since the sun did not set until 2:00a.m., performing in the late hours was not a violation of Jewish observance.[12]Matisyahu met NYU film student Talia when she interviewed him for a documentary about men and women not touching. Rabbi Korn set them up,[13] and they married in August 2004.[14] Together they have sons Laivy (2005), Shalom,[15] and Menachem Mendel (2011).[16]On December 13, 2011, Matisyahu posted a beardless picture of himself on Twitter, explaining on his website:[17]In June 2012, Matisyahu appeared in an online video to promote his new single "Sunshine" with his hair dyed blonde and appeared to be without a yarmulka (skull cap),[18] causing a big stir within the Jewish blogosphere.[19][20]Miller performed for over a year as MC Truth in the Bend, Oregon band Soulfori.In 2004, Matisyahu, after having signed with JDub Records, a nonprofit record label that promotes Jewish musicians, released his first album, Shake Off the Dust...Arise. At Bonnaroo 2005, Trey Anastasio of the band Phish invited him for a guest spot on his set.[21]His major label debut album was produced by Bill Laswell, with minor contribution by pop producers Jimmy Douglass and the Ill Factor.His live album, Live at Stubb's, released in 2006, was recorded at a concert in Austin, Texas was followed by the studio album Youth.In 2005 and 2006 he toured extensively in the United States, Canada and Europe; and made a number of stops in Israel, including a performance as the supporting act for Sting in June 2006. In late 2006, he released No Place to Be, a remix album featuring re-recordings and remixes of songs from all three of his earlier albums, as well as a cover of "Message in a Bottle" by The Police.The live version of the song King Without a Crown, broke into the Modern Rock Top 10 in 2006. The accompanying video and album, Youth, produced by Bill Laswell, was released on March 7, 2006. On March 16, Youth was Billboard magazine's number-one Digital Album. In 2006, he appeared once again at Bonnaroo, this time performing a solo set.[22]In spring 2006, right before the release of Youth, he cut ties with his managers at JDub Records. JDub managed his act, but was not his record label.[23]At the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival, the film Unsettled, in which Matisyahu appears, won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary Feature. While attending the festival, he performed in an impromptu concert at the Park City Film Music Festival in Park City, Utah. In the summer of 2007 he joined 311 on their Summer Unity Tour. He also performed in the 2008 documentary Call + Response.[24]His third studio album, Light, was released on August 25, 2009, along with the live EP Live at Twist & Shout.From July 10 to July 30, 2010, Matisyahu (along with The Dirty Heads) supported Sublime with Rome (the new version of the band) on their US tour.[25]In November 2009, NBC used Matisyahu's song "One Day" as background music for their advertisement of the Olympic games. This stirred up speculation that "One Day" may become the theme song for the 2010 Olympics. However, it remained only NBC's top pick, and was not announced to be the theme song.[26]On August 2, 2010, Matisyahu revealed to OC Weekly that he has been writing new songs for his next album, which was expected to be recorded within weeks of his statement.[27]On November 26, 2010, Matisyahu released a special edition Record Store Day Black Friday 7" vinyl called, Two for independent record stores.Matisyahu recorded the Sephardic music-influenced hip hop song "Two Child One Drop" for the Sephardic Music Festival, Vol. 1 compilation album released by Shemspeed, alongside artists such as Hasidic rapper Y-Love, Israeli hip-hop group Hadag Nahash, and psychedelic rock/Sephardic fusion group Pharaoh's Daughter.[28]On August 18, 2010, Matisyahu returned to Stubb's in Austin, Texas for another live recording for Live at Stubb's, Vol. 2. The album was released on February 1, 2011.[29]In 2011 he embarked on a concert tour.In March 2011, Matisyahu took part in clip "Pure Soul". The song is of DeScribe, Hasidic Jewish singer.On May 8, 2012, Matisyahu released a new single featuring a new version of his song "Sunshine" as one of his singles of his new album Spark Seeker, which was released on July 17, 2012 in the United States.Matisyahu fuses the contemporary styles of rap, beatboxing, and hip-hop in general, with the more traditional vocal disciplines of jazz's scat singing and Judaism's hazzan style of songful prayermore often than not rolling it all into a dominant background of reggae music.[original research?] The New York Times' Kelefa Sanneh wrote that "His sound owes a lot to early dancehall reggae stars like Barrington Levy and Eek-a-Mouse."[30] The Chicago Tribune's Kevin Pang described a Matisyahu performance as "soul-shaking brand of dancehall reggae, a show that captures both the jam band vibe of Phish and the ska-punk of Sublime."[citation needed] Coming from his Jewish beliefs and compounding his use of the hazzan style, Matisyahu's lyrics are mostly English with more than occasional use of Hebrew and Yiddish.In 2006, Matisyahu stated that "All of my songs are influenced and inspired by the teachings that inspire me. I want my music to have meaning, to be able to touch people and make them think. Chasidism teaches that music is 'the quill of the soul.' Music taps into a very deep place and speaks to us in a way that regular words can't."[31]In 2009, he said about his recently released album Light, "I think the vast majority of people that respect what I do are willing to move with me. I think it's not so much about genres or styles of music as it is about expressing the emotion or the idea. ... Whatever allows you to do that, whatever style, as long as it's authentic." In 2010 he also confirmed his first speaking date at the University of Central Florida.[32]Matisyahu has performed with Kenny Muhammad, a Muslim beatboxer. He also recorded the song "One Day" along with Akon.[33]Matisyahu is featured on Trevor Hall's single "Unity" from his self-titled album. Matisyahu is also featured on "Roots in Stereo" and "Strength of My Life" from P.O.D.'s album Testify.Matisyahu collaborated with Infected Mushroom on the song "One Day", as well as during various live sets.Matisyahu collaborated with Moon Taxi on the song "Square Circles" off the band's 2012 release "Cabaret".He has also collaborated with The Crystal Method in their single "Drown in the Now."He is featured on The Dirty Heads's album Cabin by the Sea on the single "Dance All Night".Since his debut, Matisyahu has received positive reviews from both rock and reggae outlets. In 2006 he was named as Top Reggae Artist by Billboard[34] as well as being named a spokesperson for Kenneth Cole.[35] In 2006 Esquire's Esky Music Awards - Most Lovable Oddball in The magazine called him "the most intriguing reggae artist in the world."[36][37][37][37][37][47][37]1 Biography

The Black Eyed Peas is a North American hip hop group. It mainly comprises rappers will.i.am, apl.de.ap, and Taboo, and singer Fergie. Originally an alternative hip hop group, they have since added R&B, pop, dance, electro and techno influences. Though founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album Elephunk in 2003 that they found widespread acclaim and achieved high record sales. Since that time, the group has sold an estimated 56 million records worldwide.[1] According to Nielsen SoundScan, the Black Eyed Peas are the second-best-selling artist or group for downloaded tracks, with over 42 million sales as of the end of 2011.[2]Their first major hit was the 2003 single "Where Is the Love?" from Elephunk, which topped 13 international charts. Another European hit single from the album was "Shut Up". Their fourth album Monkey Business, was an even bigger worldwide success, certified 4 Platinum in the U.S., and spawning two singles, "My Humps" and "Don't Phunk with My Heart". In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles "Boom Boom Pow" and "I Gotta Feeling"; which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks. The album later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with "Imma Be", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album before being followed with "Rock That Body" and "Meet Me Halfway" which managed to peak in the Top 10 of Hot 100. "I Gotta Feeling" became the first single to sell more than 1 million downloads in the United Kingdom.[3] The Black Eyed Peas were ranked 12th on the Billboard's Decade-End Chart Artist of the Decade, and 7th in the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade. On the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, which held in January, 2010 they won 3 awards out of 6 nominations.In November 2010, they released the album The Beginning. In February 2011, the group performed at the Super Bowl XLV halftime show. The album's first two singles "The Time (Dirty Bit)" and "Just Can't Get Enough" became international hits and topped the charts in many countries.During an interview with NRJ, will.i.am talking about his solo album also confirmed that The Black Eyed Peas will start recording sessions for their seventh studio album in 2013.[4]The Black Eyed Peas date back to 1988, when eighth-graders William Adams (will.i.am) and Allan Pineda (apl.de.ap) met and began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) in 1992, catching the attention of Eazy-E manager Jerry Heller's nephew. Along with another friend of theirs, Dante Santiago, they called their trio Atban Klann (ATBAN: A Tribe Beyond a Nation).[5] Will 1X (aka will.i.am), apl.de.ap, Mookie Mook, DJ Motiv8 (aka Monroe Walker), and Dante Santiago formed Atban Klann. Their debut album, Grass Roots, was never released due to Ruthless records founder Eazy-E's death.[5] Internet in Serena After Eazy-E died in 1995, Atban Klann reformed and changed their name to Black Eyed Pods, and then Black Eyed Peas. Dante Santiago was replaced with Jaime Gomez (Taboo), and Kim Hill became a steady background singer. Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the "Gangsta Rap" sounds of Los Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. After being signed to Interscope Records and releasing their debut, Behind the Front (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was "Joints & Jam", and was featured on the Bulworth soundtrack. Their second album was Bridging the Gap (2000), which had the single "Request + Line" featuring R&B singer Macy Gray.Their third album Elephunk began development on November 2, 2001, but was not released until 2003. It was the first album to feature the vocals of current member Fergie. Nicole Scherzinger was originally approached to join the Peas, but was forced to decline because she was a member of Eden's Crush and was under contract. Dante Santiago then introduced will.i.am to Fergie, who joined the band in 2002. Elephunk is also the first album that indicated and demonstrated the new, polished pop sound designed to attract mass audiences. In a positive review of The Black Eyed Peas' new-found style, Rolling Stone noted that since 2002, when the group "hired a blond bombshell named Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred, they have made a kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs  a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their United Colors of Benetton worldview."[6]From Elephunk came "Where Is the Love?", which became The Black Eyed Peas' first major hit, peaking at No.8 on the U.S. Hot 100, but topping the charts in several other countries, including seven weeks at No.1 in the United Kingdom, where it became the biggest-selling single of 2003. The single had similar results in Australia, staying at No.1 for six weeks. In an interview with TalkofFame.com, Taboo shared that Justin Timberlake's split with Britney Spears impacted the recording of "Where Is The Love?".[7]The album subsequently spawned "Shut Up", which peaked at No.2 in the UK and topped the charts in many success and went Gold and Platinum in the U.S., UK, Germany, and other European markets.The third single from the album, although significantly restyled from the original Elephunk version, "Hey Mama" hit the top 5 in Australia and the top 10 in the UK, Germany and other European countries and reached No.23 in the U.S. The song received even more exposure in 2003 when it was featured in the first "silhouette" television commercial for the iPod.Their fourth single from the album was titled "Let's Get It Started", which was re-titled from its original name of "Let's Get Retarded" to ensure radio play with no backlash for being considered as offensive to the mentally disabled. "Let's Get It Started" won a 2005 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group and also received two nominations for Record of the Year and Best Rap Song.In 2004, The Black Eyed Peas embarked on the Elephunk Tour, hitting many countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia.Their fourth album, Monkey Business, was recorded through 2004 and was released on June 7, 2005. Much of the pre-production writing was performed on the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus while on The Black Eyed Peas tour of 2004. The album's first single, "Don't Phunk with My Heart", was a hit in the U.S., reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100. The spot the song reached was the highest peak yet of their career in the U.S. (this was later broken when "Boom Boom Pow" peaked at the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100) and earned them another Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The song reached three in the UK, and five in Canada, and stayed at number one for three weeks in Australia. Some radio stations, concerned about complaints of obscenity, played an alternative version, "Don't Mess with My Heart". "Don't Lie", the second single from the album, saw success on the U.S. Hot 100, reaching No. 14, although becoming somewhat more successful in the UK and Australia, reaching a peak of No.6 in both countries. "My Humps", another song from the album, immediately achieved commercial success in the U.S. and fairly substantial radio play despite the sexually suggestive lyrics, reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number one in Australia, making it their fourth Australian number one single. However, many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content; John Bush, writing for Allmusic, described it as "one of the most embarrassing rap performances of the new millennium".[8] Despite this, the album Monkey Business debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart, selling over 295,000 copies in its first week and was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA. Their next and last commercially-released single from the album was "Pump It", which borrows much of its sound from "Misirlou", specifically Dick Dale's version; it peaked at number 8 in Australia but 18 in America.In September 2005, The Black Eyed Peas released an iTunes Originals playlist of their greatest hits, as well as some that were re-recorded especially for purchase through iTunes. The playlist includes popular songs such as "Don't Lie", "Shut Up", and a new version of "Where Is the Love?" It has small stories containing info and commentary about the songs and how the group first met.In autumn 2005, The Black Eyed Peas set off to tour with Gwen Stefani, as supporting act. In December 2005, they embarked on the "European Tour", which toured multiple countries in Europe. The European leg which opened in Tel Aviv, Israel, continued to Ireland, the UK, Italy and Germany. After heading to Europe and Asia, they toured the U.S. again, and South America. The Black Eyed Peas have starred in a series of web shorts for Snickers called Instant Def, appearing as a group of hip-hop superheroes.On March 21, 2006, The Black Eyed Peas released a remix album, entitled Renegotiations: The Remixes to iTunes. It features remixed versions of "Ba Bump", "My Style", "Feel It", "Disco Club", "They Don't Want Music", "Audio Delite at Low Fidelity", and the standard version and video of "Like That". The following week, it was released on CD without the music video. Participants on the EP included DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Erick Sermon, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Large Professor. In March 2006, The Black Eyed Peas hit the road again as the featured headliner for the 6th Annual Honda Civic Tour with supporting bands Flipsyde and The Pussycat Dolls. They again brought the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus on the tour with them to craft new songs for Fergie's solo debut album. In 2006, they went on tour with The Pussycat Dolls.[9][10]In 2007, The Black Eyed Peas embarked on the Black Blue & You World Tour, visiting more than 20 countries, including Macau, Sweden, Poland, Romania, Hungary, South Africa, South Korea, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Israel, Singapore, China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Australia, Nigeria, Mexico, Thailand, Venezuela, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Argentina, Philippines, El Salvador and Brazil. This tour was presented by Pepsi, in conjunction with the new "Pepsi More" advertising campaign, featuring The Black Eyed Peas. They recorded the song "More" for the new Pepsi spot. On December 31, 2006, The Black Eyed Peas performed at the last stop on the Monkey Business tour, at Ipanema Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for more than 1 million people, being their biggest concert ever. The Black Eyed Peas performed at the UK leg of Live Earth on July 7, 2007 at Wembley Stadium, London. will.i.am performed a new song, "Help Us Out", at the event, which is now on his album, Songs About Girls, as "S.O.S. (Mother Nature)". They headlined the main Ocean Stage at the Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo, Japan on August 11, and Osaka, Japan on August 12, 2007. The act consisted of the band performing their hits, as well as Fergie singing solo tracks from The Dutchess. will.i.am again sang songs from his upcoming album. Already having produced the bulk of the Peas' albums, will.i.am has begun his solo career in earnest by producing and collaborating with a variety of musicians, most notably Michael Jackson and also including U2, Srgio Mendes, Carlos Santana, Too Short, Kelis, Cheryl Cole, SMAP, John Legend, Nelly Furtado, Justin Timberlake, Nas and Bone Thugs and Harmony.The group's fifth studio album, The E.N.D. ("The Energy Never Dies"), was released on June 9, 2009. The overall sound of the album has a more electro hop beat rather than the usual hip pop/R&B feeling of their previous albums. Following its release, will.i.am remarked that the album had been inspired by a trip to Australia, specifically the sound of The Presets' "My People". "The energy on the Presets' small little stage was crazy energy. That song My People  that shit is wild," will.i.am said, "That's the reason why this record sounds the way it does  my three months in Australia."[11] In its first week, the album sold 304,000 copies and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. In the United States, the album became the ninth album to top the one million mark in sales in 2009. The album spent 38 weeks within the top 10 of the Billboard 200.

Ryan Benjamin Tedder (born June 26, 1979) is an American singer-songwriter, Grammy Award winning record producer and multi-instrumentalist.[1][2] He is best known as the frontman of the pop rock band OneRepublic, though he has an independent career as songwriter and producer for various artists such as Adele, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonc, B.o.B, Kelly Clarkson, Far East Movement, Adam Lambert, Jordin Sparks, Leona Lewis, Gavin DeGraw, David Cook, Demi Lovato, Sebastian Ingrosso, Maroon 5, Gym Class Heroes, T-Pain, Zedd, and Paul Oakenfold.[3]Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Tedder was raised by an extended family of missionaries and pastors and grew up in the church.[4][5] He began learning to play the piano at the age of three via the Suzuki method.[4] His early interest in music was prompted by his musician father and school-teacher mother, who coaxed their young son into practicing piano in exchange for candy corn.[4] Tedder started singing at the age of seven.[2] A self-taught vocalist, Tedder began honing this skill at the age of twelve by imitating his favorite artists, who ranged from The Beatles to acts as diverse as Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder and Sting. He has commented, "I sang for two hours a day every day of my life until I was eighteen."[4] He continued to perform musically during his adolescence through church, school, and personally formed groups.[2]In his senior year, he moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado.[6] There he met and became friends with future OneRepublic band-mate Zach Filkins on their soccer team at the Colorado Springs Christian School. He attended Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma and began to showcase his own material there. Tedder completed his college education and graduated from ORU in 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Relations and Advertising.[7]For years Tedder worked as a waiter, and also as a shop assistant at Pottery Barn, before securing an internship at DreamWorks SKG in Nashville, singing on demos to break into the music scene. He produced demos for songwriters and labels, charging $300 to $400 a track.[4] Tedder claims that DreamWorks offered him his first publishing deal shortly after his arrival; however, he was intent on pursuing a career as an artist and his first venture in that arena came via a different route all together.At the age of twenty-one, Tedder competed in a singer-songwriter competition and was selected by 'N Sync singer Lance Bass as one of five finalists to perform on a one-hour special on MTV, performing original material in front of millions of viewers.[8] The prize for the winner was a music contract with Bass's now-defunct management company, Free Lance Entertainment.[8] The contestants performed live and were then rated by judges and the audience; the highest scoring artist winning the contract. Tedder's performance of one of his songs, "The Look", received the most votes from the judges and fans, and he won the competition; however, a contract with a recording label was not finalized and no album was released.[8] Tedder later revealed the record and publishing deal he was offered "wasn't real. It was just a bunch of hype that didn't turn into anything."[9]One year after winning the MTV competition, Tedder caught the attention of the hip hop producer Timbaland.[10] Tedder commented that he was with Timbaland from 2002-2004 to develop as an artist while producing for other artists at the time.[9] Tedder's work crossed many musical genres (ranging from hip hop, R&B, rock, pop to dance/techno) and he has had many chart successes both in America and the United Kingdom with a number of artists. In June 2007, Tedder signed a worldwide publishing administration deal with Kobalt Music Publishing. The deal included Tedder's new works and all songs not performed by OneRepublic.Tedder is the writer of the worldwide smash hit, "Apologize", performed by his band OneRepublic, which as of 2008 is the best-selling and charting single of the decade.[11] The song broke the US Top 40 Radio Airplay Record with 10,331 spins in one week. It was the number-one most played song for five months until May 7, 2008 when Leona Lewis's "Bleeding Love" (a song that Tedder co-wrote and produced), broke the record previously set by "Apologize", with 10,665 spins in one week.[12] "Bleeding Love" was the best-selling single of 2007 in the United Kingdom, topping the UK charts for seven weeks and was the fastest selling CD of 2007 receiving the most radio airplay worldwide prior to its US debut. The song also earned a Best British Single award nomination at the Brit Awards in February 2008 and reached number one in over 35 countries. Tedder and co-writer Jesse McCartney received an ASCAP award for writing the song. Tedder is also credited for writing the treatment for the second music video that was filmed for the US release of "Bleeding Love". It also earned a Record Of The Year nomination at the February 2009 Grammy awards.[13]Tedder has written and produced singles with artists such as Jennifer Lopez, Adele, Carrie Underwood, Leona Lewis, Jennifer Hudson, Alexandra Burke, Backstreet Boys, Beyonc, Monrose, David Cook, Big Time Rush, Jordin Sparks, AJ McLean, Chris Cornell, Ashley Tisdale, Ludacris, Gavin DeGraw, James Blunt, James Morrison, Paula DeAnda, Hilary Duff, Timbaland, Bubba Sparxxx, Dima Bilan, Shayne Ward, Lemar, Esmee Denters, Clay Aiken, t.A.T.u., Menudo, Ashanti, Natasha Bedingfield, Whitney Houston, Westlife, Charice, Varsity Fanclub, Sugababes, Daughtry, Mario, DJ Tiesto and a number of songs with various rock acts in the US and abroad.[14] He worked with Jennifer Lopez on her 2007 single Do It Well from her album Brave, then worked with Kelly Clarkson on her 2009 album All I Ever Wanted, penning the songs "If I Can't Have You", "Impossible", "Save You", "Tip Of My Tongue" and "Already Gone", which features vocals from Ryan. He also worked with Beyonc on her album I Am Sasha Fierce, penning the song "Halo." The similarity between the songs "Already Gone" and "Halo" prompted Clarkson to publicly state that she did not know about "Halo" and that both songs were co-written by Tedder.[15] Tedder's work with Beyonc also earned him two Grammy nominations with Record Of The Year for "Halo" and Album Of The Year for I Am...Sasha Fierce at the January 2010 Grammy Awards. Tedder worked extensively on Leona Lewis's second album Echo, writing and producing many songs with her, three of which have made the album, including the first single "Happy", "You Don't Care" which features vocals from Ryan and "Lost Then Found", which features OneRepublic. Tedder co-wrote and produced Jordin Sparks' lead single "Battlefield" from her second album of the same name. Tedder worked on American Idol Season 8 runner up, Adam Lambert's debut album For Your Entertainment.In late 2009, Tedder launched his own record company, Patriot Records. Recently signed buzz artist My Name Is Kay, will release her debut EP through Interscope in 2012. Nikki Flores' single "City Lights" was released in the fall of 2010 on Universal/Republic Records. Tedder also formed his own publishing company, Patriot Games Publishing, in 2009 in alliance with Kobalt Music Publishing Worldwide. To date he has a stable of top notch writers and producers such as Inflo, Noel Zancanella, and Brent Kutzle, cellist/bassist of OneRepublic. The Patriot team of writers and producers with Tedder are credited with "I Was Here" by Beyonc, "Good Life" by OneRepublic, "I Just Had Sex" by The Lonely Island featuring Akon, "Lost Then Found" by Leona Lewis and OneRepublic, "Just a Guy" by BC Jean, "Count on You" by Big Time Rush featuring Jordin Sparks, and "And Then We Dance," the #1 hit single from Australia's Got Talent winners Justice Crew.More recently, Ryan is credited with writing and producing hits from some of 2011's most anticipated albums, including Adele's "21," Beyonc's "4," Colbie Caillat's "All Of You," Gavin Degraw's "Sweeter," among others.Tedder worked on Demi Lovato's third album Unbroken, released on September 20, 2011. About working with her, Tedder commented, "Demi blew me out of the water vocally! I had no idea how good her voice is. She's one of the best singers I've ever worked with. Literally, that good... I mean, she's a Kelly Clarkson-level vocalist. And Kelly has a set of pipes". In 2011, he composed a new song for Vanness Wu, "Is this All" in Taiwan. He co-wrote David Cook's "The Last Goodbye" from his second album.[16] He produced a song for K'naan titled "Better".[17] He co-wrote "Good in Goodbye" for Carrie Underwood's third album Blown Away, released on May 1, 2012. He produced tracks for Maroon 5's new album Overexposed. He has also been working on tracks for Jennifer Lopez's new untitled 2012 album, one of the songs being "Clothes Off".[18] Tedder co-wrote and co-produced the song "Sattelite" for British band The Wanted which appears on their US album released on April 24, 2012.[19] He also worked on B.o.B's Strange Clouds, released in May 2012; he produced and co-wrote single "So Good" and is featured on "Never Let You Go".Tedder was featured in Far East Movement's 2010 hit single "Rocketeer," as well as the current Gym Class Heroes single,"The Fighter". He has also recorded vocal tracks for Sebastian Ingrosso and Alesso's dance music track he also co-wrote, titled "Calling."[20]Tedder is currently working with Ellie Goulding, Trey Songz, Jason Derulo, Cody Simpson, Lady Antebellum, Marina and the Diamonds, Dan Black, and Lights on their forthcoming studio albums.[citation needed]Tedder was also a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.[21]As well as producing, Tedder also sings lead vocals and plays guitar and piano for the band, OneRepublic. The five member band consisting of Tedder, Filkins, Eddie Fisher, Drew Brown, and Brent Kutzle was formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 2002 by Tedder and his high school classmate Zach Filkins.[22] Tedder has since revealed that the band was formed at a "crossroads" in his life: "I was offered two publishing deals within two months of being in NashvilleI could have just written songs and lived a carefree life, but I knew that I had to be an artist. I wanted to form a rock band and create my own sound."[4] Based in Los Angeles, OneRepublic started out as an unsigned act on the social networking website, MySpace. Since June 2004, they have accumulated over fifty million plays for their music on the site. As of 2009, they are the number-one band on MySpace and have been in the MySpace Music's Top Artists since the summer of 2006.[23]The band gained further exposure when their 2007 single, "Apologize", was re-mixed and re-released on Timbaland's compilation album, Timbaland Presents Shock Value. The remix became an international chart hit in the fall of 2007. The song broke records after gaining 10,331 spins in one week. According to SoundScan, "Apologize" is the most legally downloaded song in US digital history with sales of over 4.3 million digital downloads in the US alone.[24] It is also the second best-selling song of the decade.[25] OneRepublic's debut album, Dreaming Out Loud, includes both the song's original version and version with Timbaland, and was released on November 20, 2007 on Timbaland's Mosley Music Group imprint via Interscope Records.[26] The band had previously been signed to Columbia Records, and their album was due to be released in 2006, but this did not occur. Tedder explained, "Crap happened. People got fired. Labels merged and politics abounded".[27] Subsequently, the band was released from their deal with Columbia, and they were signed by Timbaland in the summer of 2006 becoming the first rock band to be signed to Mosley Music Group.[27] Tedder has commented on the success of his band's hit single, "Apologize": "The toughest thing to do is write a hit song, but we had a hit song before we had an album What has happened has been really strange and really great."[26]Tedder is a multi-instrumentalist. During OneRepublic's performances, he often switches from singing lead vocals to playing guitar, bass guitar, glockenspiel, tambourine, or piano. On rare occasions, he plays drums alongside the band's main percussionist, Eddie Fisher.The band finished recording their second album, titled "Waking Up" on August 25, 2009, and released their lead single, "All the Right Moves" to radio and iTunes everywhere except Germany and Austria, where "Secrets" was released instead. The album was released on November 17, 2009 in the United States. To date, the second US single, "Secrets" has reached over 2 million digital downloads, and third single "Good Life" broke into the Top 10 on iTunes and radio everywhere.In January 2012, the band was working on their upcoming album.[28] Upon an interview from the 2012 Grammys, Ryan announced that they were halfway through working on it. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of Feel Again, a single from the album, will be donated to Save the Children's Every Beat Matters campaign to support training frontline health workers around the world.[29]Ryan Tedder is married. He openly acknowledged and thanked his wife, Genevieve, in the liner notes of OneRepublic's debut album Dreaming Out Loud. Ryan and Genevieve have a son, Copeland Cruz Tedder, born on August 2, 2010 in Denver, Colorado.[30] Tedder's second cousins, Adam, Ashley and Austin Clark comprise the band Sons of Sylvia and were formerly in The Clark Family Experience. He co-wrote their song "Love Left to Lose".[31] Despite being a Christian, he does not want to be labeled as a "Christian artist".[5] He has on one arm a tattoo written in old Japanese which he got while he was in Osaka, meaning "God's will" and literally means "God gives and God takes".[32][33]Tedder became involved with Southern Hospitality, a restaurant co-created in 2007 by Justin Timberlake at Second Avenue in Manhattan,[34] when it opened a second location in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan.[35] On August 22, 2011, it was announced that Tedder had become the first franchisee of the Southern Hospitality BBQ brand and that there were plans to bring the concept in ten cities across the United States including Denver, Nashville, Dallas, Austin, Houston, New Orleans, Atlanta, Phoenix, Palo Alto and Washington, D.C.[36] They will open a restaurant in the St. Elmo Hotel in October 2012.[34]1 Early life and education2 Career

Christopher Anthony John "Chris" Martin (born 2 March 1977) is an English singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, and is the lead vocalist, pianist, rhythm guitarist and founder of the band Coldplay.Chris Martin was born in Whitestone, Exeter, Devon and is the eldest of five children. His father, Anthony Martin, is a retired accountant, and his mother, Alison Martin, is a music teacher.[1][2] Martin started his education at the pre-preparatory Hylton School and then went on to preparatory Exeter Cathedral School.[3] It was at the prep school that Martin formed his first band, The Rocking Honkies, with Nick Repton and Iwan Gronow. Their debut performance was met with boos from the crowd.[4] After Exeter Cathedral, Martin boarded at Sherborne School, a boys' independent school in Dorset. He also met future Coldplay manager Phil Harvey at the school.[5] Martin continued his studies at University College London, staying at Ramsay Hall where he read Ancient World Studies and graduated with First Class honours in Greek and Latin.[2][6] It is here he met future Coldplay bandmates Jonny Buckland, Will Champion and Guy Berryman.[7]While studying at University College London, Martin met Jonny Buckland, Will Champion and Guy Berryman. In January 1998, they formed the rock band Coldplay. The band has had internationally recognised fame and success since their debut album, Parachutes, in 2000. Since then, they have released several further albums/EPs including: A Rush of Blood to the Head, Live 2003, X&Y, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, Prospekt's March, LeftRightLeftRightLeft and Mylo Xyloto.As a solo artist, Martin has written songs for a variety of acts including Embrace ("Gravity") and Jamelia ("See It in a Boy's Eyes", co-written with Coldplay producer Rik Simpson). Martin has also collaborated with Ron Sexsmith, Faultline when he sang on two haunting Faultline tracks: 'Where is My Boy?' and 'Your Love Means Everything Part2.', The Streets, and Ian McCulloch. He also sang a part of the vocals for the Band Aid 20 single, "Do They Know It's Christmas?" at the end of 2004. In 2005, Martin collaborated with Nelly Furtado on the track "All Good Things (Come to an End)", for her 2006 album, Loose. The two were once rumoured to be a couple, after they both performed at Glastonbury in 2002. Furtado joked about the situation, saying that "Yeah, he's my boyfriend  he just doesn't know it yet".[8]Martin's fascination with hip hop was shown in mid-2006 when he collaborated with rapper Jay-Z for the rapper's comeback album Kingdom Come after the two met earlier in the year. Martin put some chords together for a song known as "Beach Chair" and sent them to Jay-Z who enlisted the help of hip hop producer Dr. Dre to mix it (contrary to popular opinion it was Coldplay producer Rik Simpson and not Dre who conceived and performed the drum beats). The song was performed on 27 September 2006 by the two during Jay-Z's European tour at Royal Albert Hall. In 2007, Martin appeared on a track titled "Part of the Plan" for Swizz Beatz' debut solo album One Man Band Man. Martin has also worked on a solo collaboration with Kanye West, with whom he shared an impromptu jam session during a 2006 concert at Abbey Road Studios.[9] He performed the chorus of "Homecoming", from West's album Graduation.Martin's and Coldplay's main influence is the Scottish rock band Travis, with Martin crediting the band for the creation of his own group.[10] U2 has been another important influence on Martin both musically and politically,[11] on whom he wrote for Rolling Stone magazine's "100 Greatest Artists of All Time",[12] in the section on U2, saying: "I don't buy weekend tickets to Ireland and hang out in front of their gates, but U2 are the only band whose entire catalogue I know by heart. The first song on The Unforgettable Fire, "A Sort of Homecoming", I know backward and forward  it's so rousing, brilliant, and beautiful. It's one of the first songs I played to my unborn baby." Martin also comments on Bono's effect on his own charity and political involvement he is even known to joke with friends referring to himself as "Crono".[11]Martin is very vocal about his love for Norwegian new wave/Synthpop band a-ha. In 2005 he stated the following in an interview: "I found myself in Amsterdam the other day and I put a-ha's first record on. I just remembered how much I loved it. It's incredible songwriting. Everyone asks what inspired us, what we've been trying to steal from and what we listened to as we were growing up  the first band I ever loved was a-ha."[13] Martin has also performed live together with Magne Furuholmen of a-ha. In November 2011, he stated that "back when we didn't have any hits of our own we used to play a-ha songs."[14]He is also known to be a fan of artists such as English alternative rock bands Oasis and Muse,[15] Irish pop group Westlife,[16] English band Radiohead, British pop groups Girls Aloud[17][18] and Take That,[19] and Canadian indie rock band Arcade Fire. Solo artists Martin likes include Leona Lewis,[20] Noel Gallagher, Kylie Minogue,[21] Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan and Hank Williams.[15]Coldplay performed R.E.M.'s "Nightswimming" with Michael Stipe on their Austin City Limits performance. During the show, Martin called "Nightswimming" "the greatest song ever written".[22]Martin and Coldplay guitarist Jonny Buckland made cameo appearances in the film Shaun of the Dead as supporters of the fictional charity ZombAid.[23] Martin has a second cameo in this film as a Zombie.[23] In 2006 Martin had a cameo role in the second series episode four of the Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant created comedy Extras. He also appears singing in the closing credits of the 2009 film Brno alongside Bono, Sting, Slash, Snoop Dogg, and Elton John.[24] Martin also played one gig with the "Sid James Experience".Martin has been particularly outspoken on issues of fair trade and has campaigned for Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign. He traveled to Ghana and Haiti to meet farmers and view the effects of unfair trade practices.[25] When performing he usually has variations of "Make Trade Fair", "MTF" or an equal sign written on the back of his left hand and the letters "MTF" can be seen emblazoned on his piano.[26]He was a vocal critic of President George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. Martin was a strong supporter of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, most notably during his acceptance speech for the 2004 Grammy Awards Record of the Year, accepting for "Clocks". Martin also supported the Democratic Party candidate for President in 2008, giving a shout-out to Barack Obama at the end of a performance of "Yellow" on 25 October 2008 episode of Saturday Night Live.[27]On 1 April 2006, The Guardian reported that Martin was backing the British Conservative Party leader David Cameron and had written a new theme song for the party titled "Talk to David".[28][29] This was later revealed to be an April Fool's joke. Whilst touring Australia in March 2009, Martin and the rest of Coldplay were the opening act at the Sound Relief benefit concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney, for the bushfires and floods in Victoria and Queensland.Martin appeared in a video for the "Robin Hood Tax" campaign, which proposes a tax on stock trades in the United States.[30] This tax is aimed at leveling the field between the so-called "1% and 99%". Days later, Martin and wife Gwyneth Paltrow bought a 10.45 million dollar home in an upscale neighborhood of Los Angeles.[31]Martin is married to Gwyneth Paltrow. The couple married on 5 December 2003.[32] Their daughter, Apple Blythe Alison Martin, was born on 14 May 2004 in London.[33] Their second child, Moses Bruce Anthony Martin, was born on 8 April 2006 in New York City.[34] Simon Pegg and Martin's bandmate Jonny Buckland are Apple's godfathers.[35][36] Martin is a longtime friend of Pegg, having met him in 2001, and appears in one of Pegg's movies,Shaun of the Dead,[23] along with Buckland.Martin does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.[37] PETA declared him to be the World's Sexiest Vegetarian in 2005.[38]Martin was raised as a Catholic but has since lapsed. In a 2005 Rolling Stone magazine interview, Martin said of his religious views: "I definitely believe in God. How can you look at anything and not be overwhelmed by the miraculousness of it?"[39] In the same interview he spoke of going through a period of spiritual confusion, stating "I went through a weird patch, starting when I was about sixteen to twenty-two, of getting God, religion, superstition, judgement all confused".[39] However, in a 2008 interview he stated:Following the said interview, he released a text message declaring himself an "all-theist", a word of his invention meaning that he believes in "everything".[40]Martin often suffers from insomnia and has undergone sleep therapy.[41] He has said in interviews that ideas for songs most often come to him at night, and that he also often has nightmares about performances going wrong.[41]Martin is a supporter of the Liberal Democrats, a centre-left political party.[42]In a 2012 interview with the British tabloid Daily Mail, Martin revealed that he has had tinnitus for the past ten years and he developed it from listening to loud music when he was a teenager. He brings strong awareness to this condition and warns youngsters to avoid the same fate, while also protecting his own children's hearing with headphones.1 Early life2 Recording career

Raymond "Ray" Kurzweil (/krzwal/ KURZ-wyl; born February 12, 1948) is an American author, inventor, and futurist. Aside from futurology, he is involved in fields such as optical character recognition (OCR), text-to-speech synthesis, speech recognition technology, and electronic keyboard instruments. He is the author of several books on health, artificial intelligence (AI), transhumanism, the technological singularity, and futurism. Kurzweil is generally recognized as a public advocate for the futurist and transhumanist movements, due to his stances on life extension technologies, his efforts to forecast future advances in technology, and his interest in the concept of the technological singularity. At the same time, he has attracted significant criticism from scientists and thinkers.Ray Kurzweil grew up in the New York City borough of Queens. He was born to secular Jewish parents who had escaped Austria just before the onset of World War II, and he was exposed via Unitarian Universalism to a diversity of religious faiths during his upbringing. His father was a musician and composer and his mother was a visual artist. His uncle, an engineer at Bell Labs, taught young Ray the basics of computer science.[1] In his youth, he was an avid reader of science fiction literature. In 1963, at age fifteen, he wrote his first computer program.[2] Later in high school he created a pattern-recognition software program that analyzed the works of classical composers, and then synthesized its own songs in similar styles. In 1965, he was invited to appear on the CBS television program I've Got a Secret, where he performed a piano piece that was composed by a computer he also had built.[3] Later that year, he won first prize in the International Science Fair for the invention;[4] he was also recognized by the Westinghouse Talent Search and was personally congratulated by President Lyndon B. Johnson during a White House ceremony.In 1968, during his sophomore year at MIT, Kurzweil started a company that used a computer program to match high school students with colleges. The program, called the Select College Consulting Program, was designed by him and compared thousands of different criteria about each college with questionnaire answers submitted by each student applicant. When he was 20, he sold the company to Harcourt, Brace & World for $100,000 (roughly $500,000 in 2006 dollars) plus royalties.[5] He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Literature in 1970 from MIT.In 1974, Kurzweil started the company Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. and led development of the first omni-font optical character recognition systema computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font. Before that time, scanners had only been able to read text written in a few fonts. He decided that the best application of this technology would be to create a reading machine, which would allow blind people to understand written text by having a computer read it to them aloud. However, this device required the invention of two enabling technologiesthe CCD flatbed scanner and the text-to-speech synthesizer. Development of these technologies was completed at other institutions such as Bell Labs, and on January 13, 1976, the finished product was unveiled during a news conference headed by him and the leaders of the National Federation of the Blind. Called the Kurzweil Reading Machine, the device covered an entire tabletop. It gained him mainstream recognition: on the day of the machine's unveiling, Walter Cronkite used the machine to give his signature soundoff, "And that's the way it is, January13, 1976." While listening to The Today Show, musician Stevie Wonder heard a demonstration of the device and purchased the first production version of the Kurzweil Reading Machine, beginning a lifelong friendship with Kurzweil.Kurzweil's next major business venture began in 1978, when Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program. LexisNexis was one of the first customers, and bought the program to upload paper legal and news documents onto its nascent online databases.Two years later, Kurzweil sold his company to Lernout & Hauspie. Following the bankruptcy of the latter, the system became a subsidiary of Xerox formerly known as Scansoft and now as Nuance Communications, and he functioned as a consultant for the former until 1995.Kurzweil's next business venture was in the realm of electronic music technology. After a 1982 meeting with Stevie Wonder, in which the latter lamented the divide in capabilities and qualities between electronic synthesizers and traditional musical instruments, Kurzweil was inspired to create a new generation of music synthesizers capable of accurately duplicating the sounds of real instruments. Kurzweil Music Systems was founded in the same year, and in 1984, the Kurzweil K250 was unveiled. The machine was capable of imitating a number of instruments, and in tests musicians were unable to discern the difference between the Kurzweil K250 on piano mode from a normal grand piano.[6] The recording and mixing abilities of the machine, coupled with its abilities to imitate different instruments made it possible for a single user to compose and play an entire orchestral piece.Kurzweil Music Systems was sold to Korean musical instrument manufacturer Young Chang in 1990. As with Xerox, Kurzweil remained as a consultant for several years. Hyundai acquired Young Chang in 2006 and in January 2007 has appointed Raymond Kurzweil as Chief Strategy Officer of Kurzweil Music Systems.[7]Concurrent with Kurzweil Music Systems, Kurzweil created the company Kurzweil Applied Intelligence (KAI) to develop computer speech recognition systems for commercial use. The first product, which debuted in 1987, was an early speech recognition program.Kurzweil started Kurzweil Educational Systems in 1996 to develop new pattern-recognition-based computer technologies to help people with disabilities such as blindness, dyslexia and ADD in school. Products include the Kurzweil 1000 text-to-speech converter software program, which enables a computer to read electronic and scanned text aloud to blind or visually impaired users, and the Kurzweil 3000 program, which is a multifaceted electronic learning system that helps with reading, writing, and study skills.During the 1990s Kurzweil founded the Medical Learning Company.[8] The company's products included an interactive computer education program for doctors and a computer-simulated patient. Around the same time, Kurzweil started KurzweilCyberArt.coma website featuring computer programs to assist the creative art process. The site used to offer free downloads of a program called AARONa visual art synthesizer developed by Harold Cohenand of "Kurzweil's Cybernetic Poet", which automatically creates poetry. During this period he also started KurzweilAI.net, a website devoted towards showcasing news of scientific developments, publicizing the ideas of high-tech thinkers and critics alike, and promoting futurist-related discussion among the general population through the Mind-X forum.In 1999, Kurzweil created a hedge fund called "FatKat" (Financial Accelerating Transactions from Kurzweil Adaptive Technologies), which began trading in 2006. He has stated that the ultimate aim is to improve the performance of FatKat's A.I. investment software program, enhancing its ability to recognize patterns in "currency fluctuations and stock-ownership trends."[9] He predicted in his 1999 book, The Age of Spiritual Machines, that computers will one day prove superior to the best human financial minds at making profitable investment decisions. In 2001, Canadian rock band Our Lady Peace released an album, titled Spiritual Machines, based on Kurzweil's book. Kurzweil's voice was featured in the album, reading excerpts from his book.In June 2005, Kurzweil introduced the "Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader" (K-NFB Reader)a pocket-sized device consisting of a digital camera and computer unit. Like the Kurzweil Reading Machine of almost 30 years before, the K-NFB Reader is designed to aid blind people by reading written text aloud. The newer machine is portable and scans text through digital camera images, while the older machine is large and scans text through flatbed scanning.Kurzweil made a movie called The Singularity Is Near: A True Story About the Future[10] in 2010 based, in part, on his 2005 book The Singularity Is Near. Part fiction, part non-fiction, he interviews 20 big thinkers like Marvin Minsky, plus there is a B-line narrative story that illustrates some of the ideas, where a computer avatar (Ramona) saves the world from self-replicating microscopic robots. In addition to his movie, an independent, feature-length documentary was made about Kurzweil, his life, and his ideas called Transcendent Man. Filmmakers Barry Ptolemy and Felicia Ptolemy followed Kurzweil, documenting his global speaking tour. Premiered in 2009 at the Tribeca Film Festival,[10] Transcendent Man documents Kurzweil's quest to reveal mankind's ultimate destiny and explores many of the ideas found in his New York Times bestselling book, The Singularity Is Near, including his concept exponential growth, radical life expansion, and how we will transcend our biology. The Ptolemys documented Kurzweil's stated goal of bringing back his late father using AI. The film also features critics who argue against Kurzweil's predictions.In 2010, an independent documentary film called Plug & Pray premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival, in which Kurzweil and one of his major critics, the late Joseph Weizenbaum, argue about the benefits of eternal life.[11]Kurzweil frequently comments on the application of cell-size nanotechnology to the workings of the human brain and how this could be applied to building AI. While being interviewed for a February 2009 issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Kurzweil expressed a desire to construct a genetic copy of his late father, Fredric Kurzweil, from DNA within his grave site. This feat would be achieved by exhumation and extraction of DNA, constructing a clone of Fredric and retrieving memories and recollectionsfrom Ray's mindof his father.[12]Kurzweil is married with two children. His wife, Sonya, is a child psychologist while his son works as a venture capitalist and his daughter a choreographer.[13]Kurzweil's first book, The Age of Intelligent Machines, was published in 1990. The nonfiction work discusses the history of computer AI and also makes forecasts regarding future developments. Other experts in the field of AI contribute heavily to the work in the form of essays. The Association of American Publishers' awarded it the status of Most Outstanding Computer Science Book of 1990.[14]Next, Kurzweil published a book on nutrition in 1993 called The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life. The book's main idea is that high levels of fat intake are the cause of many health disorders common in the U.S., and thus that cutting fat consumption down to 10% of the total calories consumed would be optimal for most people.In 1998, Kurzweil published The Age of Spiritual Machines, which focuses heavily on further elucidating his theories regarding the future of technology, which themselves stem from his analysis of long-term trends in biological and technological evolution. Much focus goes into examining the likely course of AI development, along with the future of computer architecture.Kurzweil's next book published in 2004, returned to the subject of human health and nutrition. Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever was co-authored by Kurzweil and Terry Grossman, a medical doctor and specialist in alternative medicine. The Singularity Is Near was published in 2005. The book was made into a movie starring Pauley Perrette (NCIS).[15] In February 2007, Ptolemaic Productions acquired the rights to The Singularity is Near, The Age of Spiritual Machines and Fantastic Voyage including the rights to Kurzweil's life and ideas for the film Transcendent Man. The feature length documentary was directed by Barry Ptolemy.Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever,[16] a follow-up to Fantastic Voyage, was released on April 28, 2009.Kurzweil's latest book, How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed, was released on November 13, 2012.[17] Kurzweil has explored for decades the potential for artificial intelligence to enrich and increase human capabilities. Now, in his newest book he brings it all up a level by delving into reverse-engineering the brain to understand precisely how it works, and then applying that knowledge to create extremely intelligent machines. Kurzweil describes his new theory of how the neocortex, or the thinking part of the brain, works: as a self-organizing hierarchical system of pattern recognizers by compiling the most recent neuroscience research, his own research and inventions in artificial intelligence, and convincing thought experiments. He then goes on to show how such insights will enable people to greatly improve the powers of our own mind and at the same time provides a roadmap for the creation of superintelligence.[18]He is also writing a novel called Danielle, about his imaginary superheroine daughter who solves problems through intelligence.[19]Kurzweil was referred to by Forbes as "the ultimate thinking machine."[20]Kurzweil has received many awards and honors, including:Kurzweil's central argument is derived from the predictions of Moore's Law that the rate of innovation of computer technology is increasing not linearly but rather exponentially. According to Kurzweil's argument, since growth in so many fields of science and technology depends upon computing power, these improvements translate into exponentially more frequent advances in non-computer sciences like nanotechnology, biotechnology, and materials science. Kurzweil refers to this concept as the "Law of Accelerating Returns", and has asserted that this is supported by a number of metrics.Kurzweil has forecast a number of specific technological advances with specific dates in his books, stating that before 2050 medical advances will allow people to radically extend their lifespans while preserving quality of life through the use of nanobots,[3][37] that a computer will pass the Turing test by 2029, that the first strong artificial intelligence will be a computer simulation of a human brain generated by nanorobotic brain scanning, sentient artificial intelligences will exhibit moral thinking and respect humans, and that the line between humans and machines will blur as machines attain human-level intelligence and humans start incorporating more technology.Kurzweil's application of his law to forecasting innovations have been disputed by other scientists and writers.[38]Kurzweil's standing as a futurist and Transhumanist has led to his involvement in several Singularity-themed organizations. In December 2004, Kurzweil joined the advisory board of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence.[39] In October 2005, Kurzweil joined the scientific advisory board of the Lifeboat Foundation.[40] On May 13, 2006, Kurzweil was the first speaker at the Singularity Summit at Stanford.[41]In February 2009, Kurzweil, in collaboration with Google and the NASA Ames Research Center, announced the creation of the Singularity University training center for corporate executives and government officials. The University's self-described mission is to "assemble, educate and inspire a cadre of leaders who strive to understand and facilitate the development of exponentially advancing technologies and apply, focus and guide these tools to address humanitys grand challenges".[42] Using Vernor Vinge's Singularity concept as a foundation, the University offered its first nine-week graduate program to forty students in June, 2009.Kurzweil is on the Army Science Advisory Board, has testified before Congress on the subject of nanotechnology, and has advocated that nanotechnology could solve significant global problems such as poverty, disease, and climate change, viz. "Nanotech Could Give Global Warming a Big Chill ".[43] In media appearances, Kurzweil has stressed the extreme potential dangers of nanotechnology,[3] but argues that in practice, progress cannot be stopped, and any attempt to do so will retard the progress of defensive and beneficial technologies more than the malevolent ones, increasing the danger. He suggests that the proper place of regulation is to make sure progress proceeds safely and quickly.In his 1999 book The Age of Spiritual Machines Kurzweil proposed "The Law of Accelerating Returns", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially.[44] He gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled "The Law of Accelerating Returns", which proposed an extension of Moore's law to a wide variety of technologies, and used this to argue in favor of Vernor Vinge's concept of a technological singularity.[45]Kurzweil's first book, The Age of Intelligent Machines, presented his ideas about the future. It was written from 1986 to 1989 and published in 1990. Building on Ithiel de Sola Pool's "Technologies of Freedom" (1983), Kurzweil claims to have forecast the demise of the Soviet Union due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control over the flow of information. In the book Kurzweil also extrapolated preexisting trends in the improvement of computer chess software performance to predict correctly that computers would beat the best human players by 1998, and most likely in that year. In fact, the event occurred in May 1997 when chess World Champion Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Deep Blue computer in a well-publicized chess tournament. Perhaps most significantly, Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the 1990s. At the time of the publication of The Age of Intelligent Machines, there were only 2.6 million Internet users in the world,[46] and the medium was unreliable, difficult to use, and deficient in content. He also stated that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content as well, eventually granting users access "to international networks of libraries, data bases, and information services". Additionally, Kurzweil claims to have correctly foreseen that the preferred mode of Internet access would inevitably be through wireless systems, and he was also correct to estimate that the latter would become practical for widespread use in the early 21st century.Kurzweil also claims to have accurately forecast that, by the end of the 1990s, many documents would exist solely in computers and on the Internet, and that they would commonly be embedded with sounds, animations, and videos that would inhibit their transfer to paper format. Moreover, he claims to have foreseen that cellular phones would grow in popularity while shrinking in size for the foreseeable future.In 1999, Kurzweil published a second book titled The Age of Spiritual Machines, which goes into more depth explaining his futurist ideas. The third and final section of the book is devoted to elucidating the specific course of technological advancements Kurzweil predicts the world will experience over the next century.While this book focuses on the future of technology and the human race as did The Age of Intelligent Machines and The Age of Spiritual Machines, Kurzweil makes very few concrete, short-term predictions in The Singularity Is Near, though longer-term visions are present in abundance. He discussed the singularity with Vice Magazine in April 2009.[47]In 2008, Ray Kurzweil said in an expert panel in the National Academy of Engineering that solar power will scale up to produce all the energy needs of Earth's people in 20 years.[48]Kurzweil admits that he cared little for his health until age 35, when he was found to suffer from a glucose intolerance, an early form of type II diabetes (a major risk factor for heart disease). Kurzweil then found a doctor who shares his non-conventional beliefs to develop an extreme regimen involving hundreds of pills, chemical intravenous treatments, red wine and various other methods to attempt to live longer. Kurzweil ingests "250 supplements, eight to 10 glasses of alkaline water and 10 cups of green tea" every day and drinks several glasses of red wine a week in an effort to "reprogram" his biochemistry.[49] Lately, he has cut down the number of supplement pills to 150.[50]Kurzweil joined the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, a cryonics company. In the event of his death, Kurzweil's body will be chemically preserved, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at an Alcor facility in the hope that future medical technology will be able to revive him.[51]He has authored three books on the subjects of nutrition, health and immortality: The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life, Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever and TRANSCEND: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever.[52] In all, he recommends that other people emulate his health practices to the best of their abilities. Kurzweil and his current "anti-aging" doctor, Terry Grossman, MD., now have two websites promoting their first[53] and second book.[54]He has stated that in the future, he believes everyone will live forever.[55]Kurzweil's ideas have generated criticism within the scientific community and in the media.Although the idea of a technological singularity is a popular concept in science fiction, some authors such as Neal Stephenson[56] and Bruce Sterling have voiced skepticism about its real-world plausibility. Sterling expressed his views on the singularity scenario in a talk at the Long Now Foundation entitled The Singularity: Your Future as a Black Hole.[57][58] Other prominent AI thinkers and computer scientists such as Daniel Dennett,[59] Rodney Brooks,[60] David Gelernter[61] and Paul Allen[62] also criticized Kurzweils projections.Daniel Lyons, writing in Newsweek, criticized Kurzweil for some of his predictions which turned out to be wrong; such as the economy continuing to boom from the 1998 dot-com through 2009, a US company having a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, a supercomputer achieving 20 petaflops, speech recognition being in widespread use and cars that would drive themselves using sensors installed in highways; all by 2009.[63] To the charge that a 20 petaflop supercomputer was not produced in the time he predicted, Kurzweil responded that he considers Google a giant supercomputer, and that it is indeed capable of 20 petaflops.[63] In 2009, IBM announced the commencement of its development of the IBM Sequoia for the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, which is capable of 20+ petaflops and is expected to be delivered in 2011,[non-primary source needed] two years after Kurzweil's prediction.[64]In the cover article of the December 2010 issue of IEEE Spectrum, John Rennie criticizes Kurzweil for several predictions that failed to become manifest by the originally predicted date. "Therein lie the frustrations of Kurzweil's brand of tech punditry. On close examination, his clearest and most successful predictions often lack originality or profundity. And most of his predictions come with so many loopholes that they border on the unfalsifiable."[65]Bill Joy, cofounder of Sun Microsystems, agrees with Kurzweil's timeline of future progress, but thinks that technologies such as AI, nanotechnology and advanced biotechnology will create a dystopian world.[66] Mitch Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development Corporation, has called the notion of a technological singularity "intelligent design for the IQ 140 people...This proposition that we're heading to this point at which everything is going to be just unimaginably differentit's fundamentally, in my view, driven by a religious impulse. And all of the frantic arm-waving can't obscure that fact for me."[67]Some critics have argued more strongly against Kurzweil and his ideas. Cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has said of Kurzweil's and Hans Moravec's books: "Its as if you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it all up so that you can't possibly figure out what's good or bad. It's an intimate mixture of rubbish and good ideas, and it's very hard to disentangle the two, because these are smart people; they're not stupid."[68] Biologist P. Z. Myers has criticized Kurzweil's predictions as being based on "New Age spiritualism" rather than science and says that Kurzweil does not understand basic biology.[69][70] VR pioneer Jaron Lanier has even described Kurzweils ideas as cybernetic totalism and has outlined his views on the culture surrounding Kurzweils predictions in an essay for Edge.org entitled One Half of a Manifesto.[71]1 Life, inventions, and business career

Cypress Hill is an American hip hop group from South Gate, California. Cypress Hill was the first Cuban-American/Latino hip hop group to have platinum and multi-platinum albums, selling over 18 million albums worldwide. They are one of the most well-known groups in West Coast rap and Hip Hop in general and are critically acclaimed for their first two groundbreaking albums.[1]Senen Reyes (also known as Sen Dog) and Ulpiano Sergio Reyes (also known as Mellow Man Ace) are brothers who initially lived in South Gate, California. In 1971, their family had immigrated to the United States from Cuba. In 1988, the two brothers teamed up with Lawrence Muggerud (also known as DJ Muggs) and Louis Freese (also known as B-Real) to form a hip-hop group named DVX (Devastating Vocal Excellence). The band soon lost Mellow Man Ace to a solo career, and changed their name to Cypress Hill, after a street in South Gate.[2]After recording a demo in 1989, Cypress Hill signed a record deal with the major label, Columbia Records. Their self-titled first album was released in August 1991. The lead single was the double A-side "The Phuncky Feel One"/"How I Could Just Kill a Man" which received heavy airplay on urban and college radio. The other two singles released from the album were "Hand on the Pump" and "Latin Lingo", the latter of which combined English and Spanish lyrics. The success of these singles led to the album selling two million copies in the US alone. The group made their first appearance at Lollapalooza on the side stage in 1992.Black Sunday, the group's second album, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1993, recording the highest Soundscan for a rap group up until that time. Also, with their debut still in the charts, they became the first rap group to have 2 albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 at the same time. With "Insane in the Brain" becoming a crossover hit, the album went triple platinum in the U.S. and sold about 3.25 million copies.The band headlined the Soul Assassins tour with House of Pain and Funkdoobiest as support, then performed on a college tour with Rage Against the Machine and Seven Year Bitch. In 1993, Cypress Hill also had two tracks on the Judgment Night soundtrack, teaming up with Pearl Jam on the track "Real Thing" and Sonic Youth on "I Love You Mary Jane".The group later played at Woodstock 94, introducing new member Eric Bobo, son of Willie Bobo and formerly a percussionist with the Beastie Boys. Rolling Stone magazine named the group as the best rap group in their music awards voted by critics and readers. Cypress Hill played at Lollapalooza for two successive years, topping the bill in 1995. They also appeared on the "Homerpalooza" episode of The Simpsons. Prior to Bobo joining the crew, Panchito "Ponch" Gomez sat in as a percussionist when not acting.Their third album III: Temples of Boom was released in 1995, selling 1.5 million copies and reaching number 3 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the hit single "Throw Your Set in the Air".[citation needed] Cypress Hill also contributed a track "I Wanna Get High" to the High Times sponsored Hempilation album to support NORML.Sen Dog took a break from the band to form a Los Angeles based rap rock band SX-10.[3] Meanwhile in 1996, Cypress Hill appeared on the first Smokin' Grooves tour, featuring Ziggy Marley, The Fugees, Busta Rhymes and A Tribe Called Quest. The band also released a nine track EP Unreleased and Revamped with rare mixes. In 1997, band members focused on their solo careers. Muggs released Soul Assassins: Chapter 1 featuring contributions from Dr. Dre, KRS-One, Wyclef Jean and Mobb Deep. B-Real appeared with Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J and Method Man on "Hit Em High" from the multi-platinum Space Jam Soundtrack. He also appeared with RBX, Nas and KRS-One on "East Coast Killer, West Coast Killer" from Dr. Dre's Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath album, and contributed to an album entitled The Psycho Realm with the band of the same name. Though the focus that year was not on group efforts, the band played Smokin' Grooves with George Clinton and Erykah Badu.Cypress Hill released IV in 1998 which went gold in the US, on the backs of hit singles "Tequila Sunrise" and "Dr. Greenthumb". Sen Dog also released the Get Wood sampler as part of SX-10 on the label Flip. In 1999, Cypress Hill helped with the PC crime video game Kingpin: Life of Crime. Three of their songs from the 1998 IV album were in the game ( "16 Men Till There's No Men Left", "Checkmate" and "Lightning Strikes"). B-Real also did some of the voices of the people in the game. Also in 1999, the band released a greatest-hits album in Spanish, Los grandes xitos en espaol. In 2000, Cypress Hill then fused genres with their fifth album, Skull & Bones, which was a two-disc album. The first disc, "Skull" was composed of rap tracks while "Bones" explored further the group's forays into rock. The album reached the Top 5 on the Billboard 200 and number 3 in Canada. The first single was "Rock Superstar" for rock radio and "Rap Superstar" for urban radio. Following the release of the album, Cypress Hill (along with MxPx) landed a slot opening for The Offspring on the Conspiracy of One tour. The band also released Live at the Fillmore, a concert disc recorded at the Fillmore (in San Francisco) in 2000. Cypress Hill continued their experimentation with rock on the Stoned Raiders album in 2001. However, its sales were a disappointment, as the disc did not even reach the top 50 of the US album charts. In 2001, the group appeared in the film How High.Cypress Hill recorded "Just Another Victim" for WWE as a theme song for Tazz. At the time, WWE was using original music for almost all of the wrestlers. The band released Till Death Do Us Part on March 23, 2004. The album saw the band experiment with reggae especially on the lead single "What's Your Number". The track features Tim Armstrong of Rancid on guitar and backup vocals. It is based on the classic song "The Guns of Brixton" on The Clash's London Calling and has proven to be a success on the modern rock charts. However, the album represented a further departure from the signature sound of their first four albums. The album also features appearances by Damian Marley, son of Bob Marley, Prodigy of Mobb Deep and producers the Alchemist and Fredwreck.In 2004, the song "How I Could Just Kill A Man" was included in the popular video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas created by Rockstar Games, playing on West Coast hip hop radio station Radio Los Santos. In December 2005 a best of compilation album titled Greatest Hits From the Bong was released including nine hits from previous albums and two new tracks. The group's next album was tentatively scheduled for an early 2007 release. In the summer of 2006, B-Real appeared on Snoop Dogg's single "Vato", which was produced by Pharrell Williams.In 2007 Cypress Hill toured with their full line up as a part of the Rock the Bells tour, held by Guerilla Union, and headlined with Public Enemy, Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, and a reunited Rage Against the Machine. Other acts included Immortal Technique, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, The Roots, EPMD, Pharoahe Monch, Jedi Mind Tricks, Erykah Badu, MF Doom, Sage Francis, Brother Ali, The Coup, Blue Print, Lucky I Am, Living Legends, Felt, Cage, Mr. Lif, Grouch & Eligh, Slightly Stoopid, and Hangar 18.On July 25, 2008, Cypress Hill performed at a benefit concert at the House of Blues Chicago, where a majority of the proceeds went to the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness.[4]In August 2009, a new song by Cypress Hill, titled "Get 'Em Up", was made available on iTunes. The song is featured on the Madden NFL 2010 video game.[5]In November 2009, a new version of the Guns N' Roses classic "Paradise City" performed by Cypress Hill, Slash and Fergie was made available as a bonus track to Slash's single "Sahara" from Slash's solo album Slash.Cypress Hill's eighth studio album Rise Up, features contributions from Everlast, Tom Morello, Daron Malakian, Pitbull, Marc Anthony and Mike Shinoda.[6] The album was released on Priority Records/EMI Entertainment, as the group was signed to the label by new Creative Chairman Snoop Dogg on January 15, 2010. The album was released on April 20, 2010.[7] The album's introduction single, "It Ain't Nothin'" was released as a free download from the group's official website. The song "Rise Up" was featured at WWE's pay-per-view, Elimination Chamber, as the official theme song for that event, and was released as the third single for the album, with "Armada Latina" being fourth. The song also appeared in the trailer of the movie The Green Hornet.Cypress Hill commenced its Rise Up tour in Philadelphia on April 10, 2010. Julio G had replaced DJ Muggs for the tour. Muggs had been absent due to working on several other projects, including separate albums with B-Real and Sen Dog. The group was supposed to stop in Tucson, Arizona but canceled the show in protest of the recent immigration legislation. At the Rock en Seine festival in Paris on August 27, 2010 they said in an interview that they would wait and see what happens with the legislation before going back there.[8] Cypress Hill performed at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2010, on August 28 at Leeds and August 29 at Reading.On June 5, 2012, Cypress Hill and Dubstep artist Rusko released a collaborative EP entitled Cypress X Rusko. Also in 2012, Cypress Hill collaborated with Deadmau5 on his fourth studio album Album Title Goes Here, lending vocals on "Failbait".[9]One of the band's most striking aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals.[2] In the book Check the Technique B-Real describes his nasal style, saying his rapping voice is "high and annoying... the nasal style I have was just something that I developed... my more natural style wasn't so pleasing to [DJ Muggs and Sen Dog's] ears"[10] and talking about the nasal style in the book How to Rap, B-Real says, "you want to stand out from the others and just be distinct... when you got something that can separate you from everybody else, you gotta use it to your advantage."[1] Sen Dog's voice is deeper, more violent and often shouted alongside the rapping; his vocals are often emphasized by adding an additional background/choir voice to say them. Sen Dog's style is in contrast to B-Real's, who says, "[Sen's] voice is so strong", and "it all blends together" when they are both on the same track.[10]Both B-Real and Sen Dog started writing lyrics in both Spanish and English and B-Real was inspired to start writing raps from watching Sen Dog and Mellow Man Ace writing their lyrics,[10] and originally B-Real was going to just be the writer for the group rather than a rapper.[10] Their lyrics are noted for bringing a "cartoonish" approach to violence by Peter Shapiro and Allmusic.[2][11]The sound and groove of their music, produced by Muggs, is notable for its spooky sounds and stoned aesthetic; with its bass-heavy rhythms and odd sample loops ("Insane in the Brain" is notable for having a pitched-altered horse neigh looped in its chorus), it carries a psychedelic value, which lessened in the later albums.[2][11]The band is also known for involving rock instruments. In their songs  this has caused the band to sometimes be classified as a rap rock group.[2] The double album Skull & Bones consists of a pure rap album ("Skull") and an entire CD of rap/rock songs ("Bones"). Also in IV, there is "Lightning Strikes" which doesn't truly use electric guitars, but a synthesized version of it. In the live album Live at The Fillmore some of the old classics are played in a rock/metal version, with Sen Dog's band SX-10 and Eric Bobo playing the rock instrument.The band's music is constantly subject to change: while the first album and Black Sunday follow a more minimalistic and funky sound, III (Temples of Boom) has a very dark, spooky atmosphere and heavy beats, sometimes approaching hardcore rap. IV introduced more diverse sounds on the beats while maintaining the hardcore edge. The first albums are mostly influenced by psychedelic music, but the band eventually got closer to modern rap as it is today while still experimenting with rock from time to time, like on "Skull and Bones" and "Stoned Raiders".The band involves horns in their songs, and often have guitar and horns together in the instrumentals. "What's Your Number?", "Trouble", "Tequila Sunrise", and "(Rock) Superstar" have become some of the band's most popular songs featuring these elements.Eric Bobo is part of the group Sol Invicto with producer Richie Londres and Stephen Carpenter of the Deftones.

Vincent John Martin (born 3 July 1960), better known by his stage name Vince Clarke, is an English synthpop musician and songwriter. Clarke has been a member of a number of groups, including Depeche Mode, Yazoo, The Assembly and Erasure. He is often credited as being the King of the Synthesizer.Martin was born in South Woodford, London and then he moved to Basildon, Essex. He initially studied the violin and then the piano.In the late-1970s, Martin and schoolmate Andy Fletcher formed the short-lived band No Romance in China. In 1979, he teamed up with Marlow & Gore to form French Look. Another band, named Composition of Sound, followed in 1980 with another addition of Martin Gore and also, Fletcher. Martin provided vocals until singer Dave Gahan joined the band, which was now renamed Depeche Mode. At that time, Martin adopted the stage-name Vince Clarke. The band initially adopted a slick synthesised electropop sound, which produced the album Speak and Spell and the Clarke-penned singles "Dreaming of Me", "New Life" and "Just Can't Get Enough" in 1981.Clarke left Depeche Mode shortly thereafter. There were many rumoured reasons pertaining to his departure. Clarke himself has stated that he did not enjoy the direction in which the band was going.[citation needed] He commented on Depeche Mode's later material as being a little dark for his taste, but good nonetheless. He also commented: "Martin was a strong writer. He always had been. And I think when I left, it gave him the chance just to sort of emerge as the songwriter. I mean, he could always write songs. It's not like he just started because I left".[this quote needs a citation] Clarke also stated that he didn't enjoy the public aspects of success, such as touring and interviews, and found himself frequently at odds with his bandmates, particularly on the tour bus.[1] He also stated: "I think everybody in the band, especially myself, imagined that the reason we were doing so well was because of themselves... We were pretty young and very lucky, and things had happened very quickly for us and I don't think we were really mature to handle the situation."[2] Depeche Mode went on to achieve international stardom.Clarke then teamed up with singer Alison Moyet (at the time known by the nickname of 'Alf') to form the popular synthpop band Yazoo (known as Yaz in the U.S.), which produced two albums and a string of hits including "Only You", "Don't Go", "Situation", "The Other Side of Love", "Nobody's Diary" and "Walk Away from Love".Yazoo split in 1983, and Moyet went on to have a successful solo career. Yazoo reformed in 2008 for a series of live dates to celebrate 25 years since the duo's split.In 1983 Clarke teamed up with Eric Radcliffe and it was their idea to collaborate as one-off associations with different artists on each new single, under the name The Assembly, notably with singer Feargal Sharkey they scored the Top5 hit "Never Never". In the meanwhile he founded the label Reset Records with Eric Radcliffe. During 1983 and further on in 1984, he produced four singles "The Face of Dorian Gray" "I Just Want to Dance", "Claudette" and "Calling All Destroyers" for his friend Robert Marlow, which were released on this label. They also produced an album, which was shelved but was released much later in 1999 under the name The Peter Pan Effect. In 1985, another collaboration took place with Paul Quinn of Bourgie Bourgie, the result was the single "One Day" by Vince Clarke & Paul Quinn. However, the project never took off, and Clarke moved on to other projects.[3]In early 1985, Clarke put an ad in Melody Maker for a singer, and one applicant was Andy Bell, who was a fan of his earlier projects. He teamed with Bell to form the group Erasure, and the duo became one of the major selling acts in British music with international hits like "Oh L'amour", "Sometimes", "Chains of Love", "A Little Respect", "Chorus", "Love to Hate You", "Take a Chance on Me" and "Always".The band has released 16 albums to date and have enjoyed a long string of hit singles spanning their more than two decades together, most recently topped-off by the 2005 top five hit "Breathe" taken from their Nightbird album. In 2006 Erasure produced a country-western style acoustic album consisting of mostly non-single cuts from their previous albums. This album, Union Street was preceded by the single "Boy" originally included on their 1997 Cowboy album.On 26 January 2007, in a video message on the official Erasure website,[4] the band announced the release of their sixteenth (thirteenth studio) album, entitled Light at the End of the World. Released in the UK on 21 May 2007, with a US release the following day, it was preceded by the single "I Could Fall in Love with You", released on 2 April 2007. The second single, "Sunday Girl" was subsequently released.The album was produced by Gareth Jones and was a more "dance oriented" effort than some of their more recent work with Clarke making reference to the new material sounding potentially a bit more like Andy Bell's 2005 solo effort Electric Blue.Erasure went on to tour with Cyndi Lauper, Deborah Harry, Margaret Cho and other artists, for the 2007 True Colors Tour of the United States, a tour which benefited gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender freedoms and rights. Erasure then went out on their own, headlining the "Light at the End of the World" tour in North America and Europe.The band released a new EP, Storm Chaser, in September2007. The EP contains nine tracks, one of them the winner of an online fan remix contest, for the track "When a Lover Leaves You", from the Light at the End of the World album.The most recent Erasure album, Tomorrow's World, was released in October 2011, featuring production by Frankmusik.In July 1984, Clarke teamed Stephen Luscombe of Blancmange, Pandit Dinesh and Asha Bhosle. The group, West India Company, released a four track, self-titled EP.Clarke worked with synthpop producer Martyn Ware (of Heaven 17 and The Human League) in 1999 as "The Clarke & Ware Experiment" and released the album Pretentious. The duo collaborated again in 2001 for the album Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle, which was created with "3D music technology" specifically designed for listening in headphones. 2001 also saw the release of the Clarke-produced album Erasure's Vince Clarke which featured The Peter Pan Effect, an album that he and Eric Radcliffe produced for his long-time friend, Robert Marlow. Clarke wrote "Let's Get Together" for the pop girl group Girl Authority for their second album, Road Trip. The song was originally meant to be for Depeche Mode, but was never recorded by them. Clarke also co-wrote "What Do I Want From You?" with Freeform Five, for their album Strangest Things (2005).Also in 2001, Clarke founded Illustrious Co. Ltd. with Martyn Ware, to create new forms of spatialised sound composition using their unique 3D AudioScape system, collaborating with fine artists, educational establishments, the performing arts, live events, corporate clients and educational settings round the world.[5]In 2004, Clarke provided additional music for an episode of Johnny Bravo entitled "The Time of My Life". This was a collaboration with Richard Butler (singer).Clarke was an essential component of a 2000 project called Family Fantastic.[6] They produced the album Nice!.[7] In 2007 Family Fantastic released a second album, entitled Wonderful.On 21 May 2009, Clarke was awarded by an "Outstanding Song Collection" prize, during the Ivor Novello Awards ceremony of the same day, in recognition of 30years in the music industry.Clarke was featured in the BBC Four documentary Synth Britannia.In 2012, Vince collaborated with the band The Good Natured on a track called "Ghost Train", available as a free download on their website, in exchange for a Tweet.Also in 2012, Vince produced a cover of the Depeche Mode song "Fly On The Windscreen" featuring Ane Brun.When Clarke started using synthesisers, they were predominantly analogue (digital synthesisers were rare, and would remain that way until the launch of the Yamaha DX7 in 1983[8]). In order to connect analogue synthesisers, analogue drum machines and analogue sequencers together, multiple CV/Gate cables were required between each device. This system was not standardised, so interoperability between instruments from different manufacturers was not always straightforward. In addition, some manufacturers used their own proprietary interfaces.[9] When an industry-wide standard called MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was introduced in 1983, Clarke, like most other electronic musicians, gradually migrated to the new technology. However, he continued to prefer his older analogue instruments:"... CV and Gate is tighter. I can hear and feel that it's tighter than MIDI  we can even prove it using 'scopes. Because everything is clocked simply, it arrives bang on the beat. The whole production starts to 'tick over'. Just look at Kraftwerk's stuff. I think that 'feel' has been lost with MIDI sequencers. No matter what you do with MIDI, the music will never sound as good as it did in the good old Futurist days. That's why our tracks sound the way they do."[10]For the Chorus album in 1991, he gathered together his collection of analogue synthesisers from various recording studio locations in London and set up a small studio in Amsterdam. This led Clarke to assemble an intricate patch system to more easily enable the control of his analogue instruments:"... the secret is having a good patch system  not as in patching to the mixing desk, but in patching CV and Gate. Because we don't use MIDI at all, you have to run three or four cables between each synth module  CV, Gate, Filter, Amplitude or whatever  and you've got to have a really unique system to do that."[10]In 1993 Clarke described his approach to songwriting:"Andy [Bell] and I get together with a guitar and a tape recorder, I'll strum some chords, he'll sing a melody and we work in little sections, four or eight bars long. Then we'll try stringing the sections together. It's like a jigsaw puzzle. I find it very hard to relate songwriting to synthesisers, actually  we write songs in a very traditional way. The electronic side of things is just to create the atmosphere. It's mostly just messing about..!
"Once we've worked out a song, I start programming up the arrangement on the BBC UMI sequencer, which lets me run 16 synths simultaneously. That way you get a better idea if parts are working together or not. Then we start refining the individual sounds. And finally the whole lot is transferred to my Roland MC4, piece by piece, so it's being run in CV and Gate. Once we've got that, it's a case of Andy sketching out vocal ideas  in the studio we use two 48 track digital tape machines, which gives Dinger 24 tracks just for his voice!"[10]Clarke continued to expand his collection of analogue synthesisers and in 1994 set up "37B", a recording studio built adjacent to his custom-made home, "Ammonite", in Chertsey, Surrey. From 1994 to 2003, all Erasure albums were either wholly or in part recorded at "37B".[11][12][13]In 2004 Clarke moved to Maine, USA. While waiting for his studio equipment to be shipped from the UK, he began using an Apple Mac laptop with Logic Pro, Max/MSP, and various software synthesisers (many of which were analogue emulations). Since then, he has continued to use Logic Pro, along with both software and analogue synthesisers:"Nowadays, you can take the best bits from digital and analogue. On certain projects  say, if I'm doing library music  where you need to have instant recall all the time, then it's obviously much more convenient to use the computer. When it comes to writing a new song, though, I still like to have the old analogue gear there, too. But, a lot of soft synths have a character of their own, too; the Moog Modular V is just crazy!
"I think that analogue has an inherent sound to it  it's like the old argument over vinyl versus CD. It seems that you hear more frequencies coming from an analogue synth than you do from a software synth, but the great thing about the latter is that you can do far more complex modulation, both within the synth itself and on the keyboard. To emulate any of those really complex modulations on an analogue... well, you'd need a mile of cable."[14]As of 2009, Clarke has installed his analogue synthesisers alongside his Logic Pro-based workstation in a custom-built commercial studio called "The Cabin" in Maine.[15][16][17]Current/recent studio equipment: Dave Smith Instruments Mopho, Roland System 700, Roland 100M, Roland Jupiter-8, Roland Jupiter-4, Roland MKS-80, Roland SH-1, Roland VP-330, Roland JP-8000, Roland Juno-60, Roland Juno-106, Roland Super JX, Roland D-550, ARP 2500 Modular, ARP 2600, PPG Wave 2.2, Waldorf Microwave, Waldorf Pulse, Moog Modular, Minimoog, Moog Source, E-Mu Modular System, Buchla 100 series Modular, Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, Sequential Circuits Pro-One, Oxford Synthesiser Company OSCar, Synton Syrinx, Korg MS-20, Korg MS-10, Korg 700, Korg M1, Korg DVP, Serge Modular, Polyfusion Modular, Oberheim Xpander, Oberheim SEM System, RSF Kobol, Electronic Music Studios VCS 3, Matten and Wiechers x2 48 track sequencers total 96 track., Sennheiser Vocoder VSM201, Apple iPad 2, Apple Power Mac G5, Apple MacBook Pro.[18][19]Current/recent software: Apple Logic Pro, Cycling '74 Max/MSP, Arturia ARP 2600 V, Arturia Minimoog V, Arturia Moog Modular V, GForce impOSCar, GForce Oddity, LinPlug Octopus, Muon Tau Pro, Native Instruments Absynth, Native Instruments Reaktor, Native Instruments FM7, Native Instruments FM8, Vienna Symphonic String & Choir Libraries.[19][20]Clarke has been married to Tracy Hurley since 2004. They have a son named Oscar and live together in the United States, in Maine. Tracy Hurley is the sister of the American writer Tonya Hurley whose husband, Michael Pagnotta, is the manager of Erasure. [21][22]Clarke is left-handed.Vince Clarke, ex-member of Depeche Mode collaborated with his former colleague Martin Gore for the first time since 1981 as techno duo VCMG on an instrumental minimalist electronic dance album called Ssss, released on 12 March 2012. The first EP entitled Spock was released worldwide exclusively on Beatport on 30 November 2011.[23] The second EP Single Blip was once again first released exclusively on Beatport on 20 February 2012.

Drever also plays in the folk trio Lau alongside Martin Green and Aidan O'Rourke, and has worked with numerous other British folk contemporaries including Kate Rusby, John McCusker, Eddi Reader and Julie Fowlis.Drever grew up in the Orkney Islands where he learned to play guitar and participated in the island's folk festival. In 1995 at age 17 he moved to Edinburgh where he played at the Tron Ceilidh House several nights a week. He played the double bass for a time but returned to the guitar where his style - "a highly individual blend of rhythm and harmony, folk, jazz, rock and country inflections"[1] - made him a sought after session musician.[1]In late 2000 he began playing alongside Nuala Kennedy and Anna-Wendy Stevenson in a weekly session at Sandy Bell's pub in Edinburgh. The trio became known as Fine Friday which toured in the UK, Europe and Australia and released two albums before disbanding. Drever went on to collaborate with a number of prominent folk musicians including: Cathy Ryan of Irish-American supergroup Cherish the Ladies; Scottish fiddlers John McCusker and Bruce MacGregor; Irish accordionist Leo McCann; Gaelic band Tannas; and the Irish dance show Celtic Fusion.[1] Drever is also a founding member of the folk collective Session A9, has been a member of Kate Rusby's band and has worked with contemporary folk artists Eddi Reader and Julie Fowlis.[2]In 2005 Drever formed the trio Lau along with Scottish fiddler Aidan O'Rourke and English accordionist Martin Green. The band has released two studio albums and conducted numerous tours throughout the UK and worldwide. His most recent collaboration has been with Roddy Woomble, lead singer of Scottish indie band Idlewild, and John McCusker. The trio worked, along with other notable folk musicians, on an album entitled Before the Ruin which was released in September 2008.[1][2]Before the release of Black Water, Drever had not considered a solo career. In an interview with Mojo, Drever states[citation needed]:A live DVD was released July 28, 2008, featuring Drever's "Classic Album" set at 2008's Celtic Connections.In January 2010, Drever released his second solo album, Mark the Hard Earth during Celtic Connections.[3] Drever launched the album with a concert at the Old Fruitmarket on January 29, alongside his former band, Session A9.Kris is the son of Ivan Drever, a former member of Wolfstone[4], and a cousin of game developer and drummer Terry Drever.1 Career2 Personal life3 Discography

Sophie Michelle Ellis-Bextor (born 10 April 1979) is an English singer, songwriter, model and occasional DJ. She first came to prominence in the late 1990s, as the lead singer of the indie rock band Theaudience. After the group disbanded, Ellis-Bextor went solo, achieving widespread success in the early 2000s. Her music is a mixture of mainstream pop, disco, nu-disco, and 1980s electronic influences.Her solo debut album, Read My Lips, was released in September 2001. The album reached number two on the UK albums chart and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).[1][2] The record experienced international success, selling more than 2 million copies worldwide.[3] It produced four singles, three of which reached the top three in the UK.[1] In 2003, Read My Lips won the Edison Award for "Best Dance Album".[4] Ellis-Bextor's second album, Shoot from the Hip, was released in October 2003. The album reached number nineteen in the UK and produced two top ten singles.[1] Trip the Light Fantastic, her third album, was released in May 2007 and reached number seven in the UK.[1] The album produced three singles, one of which reached the top ten in the UK.[1]In 2009, Ellis-Bextor released the Freemasons collaboration "Heartbreak (Make Me a Dancer)" and her first extended play, Sophie Ellis-Bextor: iTunes Live in London. Her fourth studio album, Make a Scene, was released in April 2011 and was a Top 20 success in Russia where it reached No.12 and was certified Gold status.Ellis-Bextor was born in London on 10 April 1979, the daughter of Robin Bextor and former Blue Peter presenter Janet Ellis who separated when she was four.[5] As a young girl, she appeared on several Blue Peter items, with no indication given on-screen that she was Ellis's daughter.She attended St. Stephen's School and later Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith. Among her earliest public performances were with the W11 Opera children's opera from the age of thirteen, and she is now a patron of the organisation.[6]Ellis-Bextor appeared with her mother Janet Ellis along in a children's DVD compilation songs video entitled 'a day full of songs' which was released by retailer Marks & Spencer. She began her musical career in 1997, with an indie band called Theaudience. Ellis-Bextor sang the lead vocal in the band. While she was a band member, readers of Melody Maker elected her to the number-one position among the 'most sexy people in rock'. She recorded a duet with Manic Street Preachers"Black Holes for the Young"as a B-side for their 1998 single "The Everlasting". Several songs released by Theaudience are "I Got the Wherewithal", "If You Can't Do It When You're Young; When Can You Do It?", "I Know Enough (I Don't Get Enough)", and "A Pessimist Is Never Disappointed" (perhaps their best-known single). The band split in December 1998. In 1999, Ellis-Bextor made an appearance on the Departure Lounge album Out of Here.After Theaudience split, Ellis-Bextor took a year off from singing. In 2000, Ellis-Bextor collaborated with Italian DJ Spiller on adding vocals to his then-instrumental club track "Groovejet", her first recorded work since that with Theaudience. "Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)" entered the UK charts at number one, just beating former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham on her first solo outing to the top spot. Since then, the two have been described as rivals. Both women deny, however, that there is any rivalry between the two of them. "Groovejet" won several awards: No.1, Pop Top20; No.1, ILR; No.1, Radio1; No.8, top dance track of 2000 and single of the year in Melody Maker. In the Metro Newspaper, it received ninth place in the contest for the Greatest No.1 of all time.[7] In 2000, it was a finalist in The Record of the Year. In that same year, it won the awards for Best Single and Best Ibiza Tune at the Ericsson Muzik Awards.[8]In 2001, Ellis-Bextor released her debut album, Read My Lips. It reached number two on the UK charts and spawned four top-twenty hit singles. Her rework of Cher's "Take Me Home" reached number two, as did "Murder on the Dancefloor", which became Ellis-Bextor's biggest single and was on charts for twenty-three weeks.[9] "Murder on the Dancefloor" became Europe's most played song of 2002. In 2002, Read My Lips was re-released with two new songs (and a live version of "Groovejet") and Ellis-Bextor won the Recording Artist Award at that year's Showbusiness Awards. Her third single, "Get Over You"/"Move This Mountain", was released in June 2002 and reached number three. The fourth single, "Music Gets the Best of Me", rose to number fourteen in December. At the beginning of 2002, Ellis-Bextor was nominated for the "British Female Solo Artist" BRIT Award, going on to be nominated for a further two consecutive years.[10][11][12]Her second album, Shoot from the Hip, was released in October 2003. Although it was not as commercially successful as her previous material, it held two further top-ten singles. The album reached no higher than number fourteen on the UK charts; its two singles were "Mixed Up World", which reached number seven, and "I Won't Change You", reaching number nine. Around this time, rivalry against Victoria Beckham was suggested again; Beckham's single "This Groove"/"Let Your Head Go" reached number three, a higher position in the charts than "I Won't Change You". During this time Ellis-Bextor became pregnant and plans for a third and fourth single from the album, as well as the Shoot from the Hip Tour, were scrapped. After that, Ellis-Bextor took a break from her musical career to take care of her first child.In early 2005, she performed on a track by the duo Busface, entitled "Circles (Just My Good Time)"; she was credited as "Mademoiselle E.B." to not have this be mistaken for a single from her next album.In 2006, her track "Dear Jimmy" was released on the Popjustice compilation album 100% Solid Pop Music.Her third album, Trip the Light Fantastic, was released in May 2007 and debuted at number seven on the UK Albums Chart. Fred Schneider of The B-52s, Richard Barone (formerly of The Bongos), Shelly Poole (formerly of Alisha's Attic), Cathy Dennis and Kerin Smith (formerly of Theaudience) contributed to produce an album of disco-pop music. Before the album, two singles were released: "Catch You", which charted in the UK at number eight, and "Me and My Imagination (number twenty-three). Trip the Light Fantastic was certified Gold in July 2008, for selling 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.[13] The third single, "Today the Sun's on Us", debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number sixty-four.Ellis-Bextor supported George Michael on his UK tour leg in June 2007. Her own UK tour, the Trip the Light Fantastic Tour, was due to start in August 2007, but it was postponed after Ellis-Bextor was invited to be the "special guest" on Take That's Beautiful World Tour, which commenced in October 2007.[14] Ellis-Bextor stated that her tour would be re-scheduled for March 2008, with all tickets purchased being valid for the rescheduled concerts. The tour was never re-scheduled, and Ellis-Bextor subsequently refused to discuss the issue in interviews.[15] In September 2007, Ellis-Bextor took part in Sopot Festival 2007 in Poland, representing the UK.The song "If I Can't Dance" was announced as a single but later retracted,[14][16] as was "Love Is Here"; Ellis-Bextor was supposed to release a single in late November to promote a greatest hits album, but the release date was pushed back to March 2008, and subsequently cancelled. However, "If I Can't Dance" has appeared on several compilations in Spain such as Supermodelo 2008 CD and Disco Estrella 2008.According to Ellis-Bextor in April 2008, recording sessions for her scrapped greatest hits collection proved fruitful, so she decided to release a fourth studio album.[citation needed] In October 2008, Ellis-Bextor covered the Dolly Parton song "Jolene"; the track was released on the soundtrack to the BBC2 sitcom Beautiful People. In early November 2008, Ellis-Bextor recorded a track with the French DJ Junior Caldera, "Can't Fight This Feeling", for his 2009 album Dbut. Released as a single in February 2010, it reached the top twenty in France.In November 2008, Ellis-Bextor confirmed her next single would be "Sophia Loren", which was used in a Rimmel ad campaign in which she also starred, but a single release never materialised.[citation needed] In August 2009, she released a five-track live EP from the 2009 iTunes Festival, during which she performed previous singles of hers and a new track, "Starlight" (not included on the EP). Freemasons worked with Ellis-Bextor for their album Shakedown 2 on "Heartbreak (Make Me a Dancer)", which was released as a single in June 2009 and peaked at number thirteen in the UK. Ellis-Bextor performed at Birmingham's Nightingale Club in January 2010.Ellis-Bextor's fourth album, Make a Scene, was released in June 2011.[17] She described it as "very much [a dance album]more so than any of my other albums. What I'm planning next though is an album that's really different. I think I need to do something different now and move on from the dance stuff. I might come back to it, but I think this album is a good way to bow out of the dance sound for now. I think it's finishing on a high."[18] She worked with Calvin Harris, Armin van Buuren,[19] Richard X, Dimitri Tikovoi, Hannah Robinson, Metronomy,[20] and Liam Howe from the Sneaker Pimps. The first single from the album, "Bittersweet" (co-written by Freemasons and Hannah Robinson[21]), was released in May 2010 and reached number twenty-five on the UK Singles Chart. "Not Giving Up on Love" was released as the second single from the album, in August 2010 in Europe,[22] followed by "Starlight" as the third single in May 2011. "Off & On" was the fourth and final single.In May 2011, she revealed that she has already began work on her fifth album.[23] She returned to the international tour scene in 2011, playing venues such as Jakarta's SoulNation festival, as well as returning to Australia by playing gigs in Sydney and Melbourne.[24] Ellis-Bextor collaborated with French DJ Bob Sinclar on a track titled "Fuck With You", which was included on his album, Disco Crash.[25][26]Ellis-Bextor's collaboration with French DJ Mathieu Bouthier, "Beautiful", was released on 16 July 2012 in France through iTunes.[27]In 2007, Ellis-Bextor appeared at Christmas in the Robbie the Reindeer episode, "Close Encounters of the Herd Kind". Ellis-Bextor was depicted as a female alien at the closure of the story, singing the song 'Supersonic', the last track on her third solo studio album Trip The Light Fantastic. In November of this year she also launched the npower Greener Schools Programme, which aims to give schools in the UK a 'green makeover' by providing free energy audits, implementing tailor-made energy efficiency measures to reduce their carbon footprint, and educating children on how to be greener[28] She also launched Capital Radio's Capital 95.8 'Lights Out London' campaign, which asks Londoners to switch off their lights for one hour in a bid to save 750 MWh and send a message to the world on the importance of climate change.[29]In 2008 she features in the short musical film The Town that Boars Me by photographer Ben Charles Edwards. The film also features Jodie Harsh, Kelly Osbourne and Zandra Rhodes. The film is set to debut in late summer at the Portobello Film Festival and is produced by Glass Loves and Shoot to Kill Productions.[30][31]An advocate for animal rights, she posed for PETA's antifur clothing advertisement.[32] She is also currently fronting a campaign for The Children's Society encouraging people to log onto the Hundreds and Thousands of Childhood Memories Website to donate their favourite childhood memory.[33]She auditioned for the 2001 movie Moulin Rouge! for the part of Satine.[34]In May 2008 Ellis-Bextor was hired by cosmetics brand Rimmel as one of their new faces.

Despite losing on the final question, 5000 was donated to their chosen charity.Ellis-Bextor has made a cameo appearance in the BBC2 sitcom, Life's Too Short, created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, which centers on an angry entertainment agency boss who exploits his fellow dwarf clients. The sitcom premiered on 10 November 2011.[36]In 2005, Ellis-Bextor married The Feeling bassist Richard Jones at Palazzo Terranova in Italy.

Pendulum is an Australian/British drum and bass duo[2] founded in 2002 in Perth, Western Australia by Rob Swire, Gareth McGrillen, and Paul Harding.[3] As of 2012, the live band have parted ways to focus on side projects, but the DJ set will remain active. Swire has also said that they may possibly make another album, but not until at least 2014.[4]Swire and McGrillen were members of the metal band known as Xygen. After hearing Konflict's "Messiah" at a club, they were inspired to enter into the drum and bass genre.[5] They founded Pendulum with Harding, who was a veteran DJ in the drum and bass scene. In 2003 the band relocated to the United Kingdom.While Hold Your Colour holds true to the drum and bass genre, Pendulum have since experimented with mixing other genres into their work, as can be heard on In Silico and Immersion. Their newer releases incorporate styles from genres such as hard rock, heavy metal,[6] electronic rock, grime, dubstep, breakbeat and electro house.Pendulum formed in Perth, Australia and released their first song, "Vault", as the A-side of the Kingz of the Rollers EP in 2003.[7]After releasing several singles such as "Spiral" / "Ulterior Motive" and many tracks to be included in their forthcoming release, Pendulum released their debut album, Hold Your Colour in 2005. Notably, the album has successfully become one of the most popular drum and bass albums ever sold. The album has sold 225,000 copies in the UK alone. It entered the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart for the first time on 25 May 2008, peaking at No.29 by 16 August.The coverdesign of the album was done by Vince Peersman of www.foldesign.com, one of the most prominent graphic artists for drum 'n bass music covers.The album was re-issued in 2007, and had a slightly different track listing. The final two songs, "Another Planet" and "Still Grey" were replaced by "Blood Sugar" and "Axle Grinder". As well as this, the re-issued version also erroneously contains gaps at the end of each track, causing the album to lose its original sense of flow.Their second album, In Silico, was released in May 2008. This release saw the band's first deviation from the drum and bass genre and incorporated more rock sounds. The second single from the album, "Propane Nightmares", peaked at No.9 in the UK Singles Chart, and brought the band mainstream success. In 2008 in support of the album, Pendulum played at numerous European music festivals and undertook their first tour of North America. At the end of the year the band filmed a live DVD on 4 and 5 December 2008, at the Brixton Academy. This was later released in June 2009.[8]Pendulum once again toured Europe in 2009. During this tour they announced that they were working on their third studio album, Immersion. It was announced in December that Pendulum will be touring for their new album in May 2010. The release date of the album was announced to be sometime "in May" during the live preview party at Matter, and was then announced to be released on 24 May.Pendulum previewed their album Immersion at the Ear Storm night at Londons Matter nightclub on Friday 22 January, as well as streaming the material on their official website.[9] "Salt In The Wounds", a track from their new album, was Zane Lowe's Hottest Record In The World on BBC Radio 1 on 25 January 2010. It was stated however that it was a street-level release and was not an official single. On Zane Lowe's show, it was also announced that he wanted to join the band and the first single from the new album would be called "Watercolour".[10] also received its first play on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 8 March 2010, and was his Single Of The Week for that week.[11] The music video for "Watercolour" was released on 31 March and premiered on their MySpace page, and also in the members area of their official website, The Other Side. A day later, on 1 April, another music video was released, this time for "Salt In The Wounds". The video is unique in that it is, according to the band's website, "...the worlds first 360 interactive music video." Viewers can move the camera around in the video. Six letters are hidden throughout the video. Once these letters are found, the viewer can enter them as a code and claim a free download of "Salt In The Wounds".[12] Otherwise, "Watercolour" claimed the No.4 spot in the UK Single Chart, making it their biggest hit to date.On 21 May 2010, the band headlined the annual Radio 1's Big Weekend festival which was held at the Vaynol Estate, Bangor, Gwynedd.The second single from the album, "Witchcraft", was released on 18 July and charted at No.29 in the UK Singles chart, making it their third highest charted single in the UK. The third single from Immersion was "The Island", and just missed the UK Top 40 at No.41. Rob Swire had stated that if it had achieved greater success than "Witchcraft", he would have released a song entitled "Ransom", which was taken off Immersion before the album's release. "Ransom" was previewed however and became a fan favourite. As it did not do better, Swire revealed the original files for "Ransom" were corrupted, and that he has no plans to recreate them, therefore it will not be released. However, on 6 April 2011, Pendulum released "Ransom" as a single via their website with all proceeds going to the Help for Japan fund post the tsunami. "Crush" was released as the fourth single in January 2011.In January 2011, Pendulum released a Deluxe Edition of Immersion via iTunes which contained the album's original 15 tracks and a collection of remixes of "Watercolour", "Witchcraft" and "The Island" by other artists including deadmau5, Tisto and Chuckie. Both the UK and US store were also given the music videos of those three tracks in the release. However, more remixes were released in the UK store along with extra videos, including a trailer of footage from their live show at Wembley Arena that took place on 28 May 2010.On 26 October 2010, Swire announced via Twitter that a new record is in the works. This new record is set to be heavily punk influenced.[13] The next album is expected to be a significant departure from usage of drum and bass tempo, for a faster tempo in the form of punk, and a slower tempo in the form of dubstep.[14]On 29 March 2011 via Twitter, Swire revealed that there would be no "new album" for a while. He added that there would be "def new material" later in the year.Pendulum opened for Linkin Park on several selected dates during the band's 2011 "A Thousand Suns" North American tour.,[15] also headlining their own tour and being supported by Innerpartysystem.Pendulum played at the 2011 Download Festival,[16] Oxegen,[17] The Eden Sessions,[18] Glastonbury Festival[19] and T In The Park,[20] V Festival, headlined Global Gathering, an exclusive London show at South West Four [21] and finally headlined the first night of Bestival on the Isle Of Wight.On 5 April 2011 Pendulum announced via Twitter and the band's website that a previously unreleased track from Immersion, titled "Ransom", would be released on Pendulum's website, with 100% of the proceeds going to help disaster relief efforts in the wake of the 2011 Japanese tsunami.[22]Pendulum headlined at Rhythm & Vines 2011 in Gisborne, New Zealand. The band is taking a break from touring during 2012 in order to take part in side projects.Pendulum is part of major Headliners on Main Stage lineup at LovEvolution 2011 Dance Festival & Parade in Oakland, California, which has over 50 DJs and 15 or more parade floats.On 3 January 2012, Pendulum announced via Twitter that they would be taking a hiatus from touring while thanking their fans for the last several years. They went on to state that they might create a new record in 2013.[23] Swire stated on his personal Twitter that Pendulum is on hiatus, as Knife Party is now his primary project.[24]On 16 June 2012, Rob Swire announced via Twitter that there will be no further Pendulum live shows and there are no current plans for a new album in 2013. Although there are no live shows taking place in the near future according to the band, El Hornet & MC Verse still perform DJ Sets across the world.In 2012 Rob Swire and fellow member Gareth McGrillen announced in various interviews and on Swire's Twitter that a project called Knife Party had been created. The side project is not linked in any means to Pendulum and will consist of electro house, dubstep and other club genres, and is now the duo's primary project.When Pendulum was formed, their musical style was considerably more drum and bass sounding than the work they were known later in the career. Signature tunes such as "Masochist", "Vault", "Back 2 You" and "Voyager", which were released on labels such as Uprising Records, 31 Records, Renegade Hardware and Low Profile Records, have a darker, more amelodic air to them which is substantially absent from their later productions. The band's newer work is regarded as generally leaning heavily towards a mainstream, dance-driven sound. Early work such as "Another Planet" seems to indicate an early affinity with a more global sound, similar to other Breakbeat Kaos artists such as DJ Fresh and Adam F.The group has produced various remixes of other artists also; one the best-known being the remix of "Voodoo People", originally by The Prodigy. In 20082010, they covered/remixed songs including Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song", Linkin Park's "The Catalyst", Calvin Harris's "I'm Not Alone", Coldplay's "Violet Hill", and Metallica's "Master of Puppets". Pendulum's versions of "I'm Not Alone" and "Master Of Puppets" both exist as studio recordings but have not been officially released, and are only previewed during DJ sets. The original live version of "Master of Puppets" was played as an instrumental introduction for "Slam", and was featured on their first live album/DVD. During their American tour as the supporting band for Linkin Park, the song was played in its entirety, with Rob doing vocals. Pendulum have also remixed their own music and, on occasion, television theme songs, such as Australian television's "ABC News Theme" in May 2010. The remix proved to be immensely popular with listeners of Australian youth radio station triple j, polling at number 11 in the 2010 Triple J Hottest 100 countdown.[25]Pendulum's musical style consisted of a fusion of drum and bass (along with other electronic genres), alternative rock and heavy metal, with the inclusion of acoustic instruments. This creates a sound reminiscent of industrial metal, albeit with much more prominent drum and bass and, more recently, dubstep influences. Some songs, such as "Slam", "Propane Nightmares" and "Witchcraft" are synth-led, whilst others, such as "Showdown", "The Tempest" and "Comprachicos", are guitar-led. Bassist Gareth McGrillen stated in an interview on Channel 4 that they use 13 computers during the live performances, all of which are mixing the sounds produced by the instruments in real time. Rob Swire stated in issues of TJECK magazine and Rock Sound magazine that he would like to begin producing songs with a punk style to them, excluding the inclusion of electronic sounds in the near future.[26] Pendulum were known to be fans of progressive rock and progressive metal bands, which may have inspired them to fuse multiple genres of music together, which is standard practice in those genres.In 2006, Pendulum's old label Breakbeat Kaos released an album containing a 2-year-old Pendulum DJ mix without their permission, resulting in group member Rob Swire later denouncing the album on public Internet forum Dogs On Acid.[27] This issue has since been resolved; DJ Fresh is included on the list of acknowledgements in the Immersion booklet, and Pendulum is now working with Breakbeat Kaos again, on the vinyl release of the singles "Witchcraft" and "The Island".[28]Electronic musician Goldie has criticized Pendulum's single "Granite" for being what he calls a "shit single", and accused the band of not acknowledging the drum and bass scene from which they came.[29] For the band's part, in an interview with The Times Swire cited "Goldie making concept albums about space and his mum"[citation needed] (in the words of The Times reporter) as one of the reasons why he was not initially keen on the genre; he claims to have been more into "breakbeat, straight up house and hardcore" before Gareth McGrillen, who is Pendulum's bassist and was Swire's bandmate in Xygen, introduced him to "more electronic" areas of the genre.[30] This issue has since been resolved as well, according to Gareth McGrillen in an interview on The Age.[31]Despite the live band no longer performing, Swire has stated he may do another album, just not until after 2013. Paul and Ben however still actively perform the DJ set.1 History

Trance is a genre of electronic dance music that developed in the 1990s in Germany.[5] It is characterized by a tempo of between 110 and 150 beats per minute,[5] repeating melodic phrases,[5] and a musical form that builds up and down throughout a track.[5] It is a combination of many styles of electronic music such as techno,[3] house,[1] pop,[3] chill-out,[3] classical music,[3]:16[4] and film music.[4]Trance employs aural dynamics to a great degree: A characteristic of virtually all trance songs is the soft mid-song breakdown,[3][5] beginning with and occurring after the orchestration is broken down and the rhythm tracks fade out rapidly, leaving the melody and/or atmospherics to stand alone for anywhere from seconds to a few minutes. When vocals are present in trance, they are generally sung by a female with a soaring, operatic voice ranging from mezzo-soprano to soprano, best described as "ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths".[8]Germany is regarded as the birthplace of trance music,[5] with the original melodic trance sound first appearing around 1993 in Frankfurt.[3]The origin of the term is uncertain; one theory suggests that the term is derived from the Klaus Schulze album Trancefer (1981) or the early trance act Dance 2 Trance.[citation needed] Other schools of thought argue the name may refer to an induced emotional feeling, high, euphoria, chills, or uplifting rush listeners claim to experience, while other suggestions trace the name to the actual trance-like states the earliest forms of the music attempted to emulate in the 1990s before the genre's focus changed.[5]Some trace trance's antecedents back to Klaus Schulze, a German experimental electronic music artist who concentrated on blending minimalist music with repetitive rhythms and arpeggiated sounds.[citation needed] In France, Jean Michel Jarre, an early electronic musician,[9] released two albums in the late 1970s: Oxygne in 1976 and Equinoxe in 1978.[citation needed] Also a possible antecedent, Neil Young's 1982 electronic album, Trans, bears a resemblance to the trance music genre.[10] Another possible antecedent is Yuzo Koshiro's electronic soundtracks for the Streets of Rage series of video games from 1991 to 1994.[11][12][13]Examples of early Trance releases include but are not limited to German duo Jam & Spoon's 1992 12" Single remix of the 1990 song The Age Of Love.,[1] German duo Dance 2 Trance's 1990 track "We Came in Peace".[5]As for the roots of contemporary trance[citation needed], some[1] trace it to Paul van Dyk's 1993 remix of Humate's 'Love Stimulation'.[1] In subsequent years, one genre, vocal trance, arose as the combination of progressive elements and pop music,[3] and the development of another subgenre, epic trance, had some of its origins in classical music.,[3] with film music also being influential.[4]Classic trance usually employs a "four-to-the-floor" time signature,[5] a tempo of 125 to 150 BPM,[5] and 32 beat phrases and is somewhat faster than house music.[14] A kick drum is usually placed on every downbeat and a regular open hi-hat is often placed on the upbeat or every 1/8th division of the bar.[5] Extra percussive elements are usually added, and major transitions, builds or climaxes are often foreshadowed by lengthy "snare rolls"a quick succession of snare drum hits that build in velocity, frequency, and volume towards the end of a measure or phrase.[5]Rapid arpeggios and minor scales are common features. Trance tracks often use one central "hook", or melody, which runs through almost the entire song, repeating at intervals anywhere between 2 beats and 32 bars, in addition to harmonies and motifs in different timbres from the central melody.[5] Instruments are added or removed every 4, 8, 16, or 32 bars.[5]In the section before the breakdown, the lead motiff is often introduced in a sliced up and simplified form,[5] to give the audience a "taste" of what they will hear after the breakdown.[5] Then later, the final climax is usually "a culmination of the first part of the track mixed with the main melodic reprise".[5]As is the case with many dance music tracks, trance tracks are usually built with sparser intros ("mix-ins") and outros ("mix-outs") in order to enable DJs to blend them together more readily.[3][5] As trance is more melodic and harmonic than much dance music[citation needed], the construction of trance tracks in such a way is particularly important in order to avoid dissonant (or "key clashing," i.e., out of tune with one another) mixes.[citation needed]Trance music is broken into a large number of sub-genres.[citation needed] Chronologically, the major sub-genres are Classic trance, Acid trance, Progressive trance,[3] Uplifting trance,[3] and Hard trance[citation needed]. Uplifting trance is also known as "Anthem trance", "Epic trance",[3] "Stadium trance", or "Euphoric trance",[5] and has been strongly influenced by classical music both in the 1990s[3] and at present with the development of the sub-genre "Orchestral uplifting trance" or "Uplifting trance with symphonic orchestra" by such artists as Andy Blueman, Soundlift, and Arctic Moon. Closely related to Uplifting Trance is Euro-trance, which has become a general term for a wide variety of highly commercialized European dance music. Several subgenres are crossovers with other major genres of electronic music. For instance, Tech trance is a mixture of trance and techno, and Vocal trance "combines [trance's] progressive elements with pop music".[3] Balearic beat, which is associated with the laid back vacation lifestyle of Ibiza, Spain, is often called "Balearic trance", as espoused by Roger Shah.[citation needed] The genre Dream trance originated in the mid-1990s, with its popularity then led by Robert Miles.The following is a list of dance music festivals that showcase Trance music.Electronic Dance Music festivals in the Netherlands are mainly organized by four companies ALDA Events, ID&T, UDC and Q-dance:Electronic Dance Music festivals in North America feature various EDM genres such as Trance, House, Techno, Electro, Dubstep, Breaks, and Drum & Bass:1 History

Pearl Jam is an American rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. Since its inception, the band's line-up has included Eddie Vedder (vocals), Stone Gossard (guitar), Jeff Ament (bass), and Mike McCready (guitar). The band's current drummer is Matt Cameron, also of Soundgarden, who has been with the band since 1998.Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten. One of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam was criticized early on as being a corporate cash-in on the alternative rock explosion. However, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having "spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame."[1]To date, the band has sold over 31.5 million records in the U.S,[2] and an estimated 60 million worldwide.[3][4] Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade.[5] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to Pearl Jam as "the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s."[6]Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament were members of pioneering grunge band Green River during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmates Mark Arm and Steve Turner.[7] In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with Malfunkshun vocalist Andrew Wood, eventually organizing the band Mother Love Bone. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the PolyGram record label, which signed the band in early 1989. Mother Love Bone's debut album, Apple, was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died of a heroin overdose.[8]Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the resulting demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously.[9] After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament.[1] After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.[9]Irons passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his basketball buddy, San Diego, California singer Eddie Vedder.[10] Vedder was the lead vocalist for a San Diego band, Bad Radio, and worked part-time at a gas station. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him.[9] He then recorded the vocals to three of the songs ("Alive", "Once", and "Footsteps") in what he later described as a "mini-opera" entitled Momma-Son.[11] Vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were impressed enough to fly Vedder up to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band.[9]With the addition of Dave Krusen on drums, the band took the name Mookie Blaylock, in reference to the then-active All-Star basketball player. The band played its first official show at the Off Ramp Caf in Seattle on October 22, 1990,[12] and soon signed to Epic Records. However, concerns about trademark issues necessitated a name change; the band's name became "Pearl Jam".[6] In an early promotional interview, Vedder said that the name "Pearl Jam" was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for peyote-laced jam.[13] In a 2006 Rolling Stone cover story however, Vedder admitted that this story was "total bullshit", even though he indeed had a great-grandma named Pearl. Ament and McCready explained that Ament came up with "pearl", and that the band later settled on "Pearl Jam" after attending a concert by Neil Young, in which he extended his songs as improvisations of 1520 minutes in length.[1]Pearl Jam entered Seattle's London Bridge Studios in March 1991 to record its debut album, Ten[14] McCready said that "Ten was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and Eddie were along for the ride at that time."[15] Krusen left the band in May 1991 after checking himself into rehabilitation;[16] he was replaced by Matt Chamberlain, who had previously played with Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the "Alive" video, Chamberlain left to join the Saturday Night Live band.[17] Chamberlain suggested Dave Abbruzzese as his replacement. Abbruzzese joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting Ten.Released on August 27, 1991, Ten (named after Mookie Blaylock's jersey number)[13] contained eleven tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. Ten's musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an "expansive harmonic vocabulary" with an anthemic sound.[18] The album was slow to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the Billboard charts.[14] Ten produced the hit singles "Alive", "Even Flow", and "Jeremy". Originally interpreted as an anthem by many,[9] Vedder later revealed that "Alive" tells the semi-biographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather, while his mothers grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father.[9] The song "Jeremy" (sample(helpinfo)) and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.[19] Ten stayed on the Billboard charts for more than two years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13x platinum.[20]With the success of Ten, Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge explosion, along with Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. The band was criticized in the music press; British music magazine NME said that Pearl Jam was "trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets."[21] Nirvana's Kurt Cobain angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial sellouts,[22] and argued Ten was not a true alternative album because it had so many prominent guitar leads.[14] Cobain later reconciled with Vedder, and they reportedly were on amicable terms before Cobain's death in 1994.[1]Pearl Jam toured relentlessly in support of Ten. Ament stated that "essentially Ten was just an excuse to tour," adding, "We told the record company, 'We know we can be a great band, so let's just get the opportunity to get out and play.'"[23] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it."[15] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates."[24] In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on Saturday Night Live and MTV Unplugged and took a slot on that summer's Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, and Ministry, among others. The band contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the 1992 Cameron Crowe film Singles: "State of Love and Trust" and "Breath". Ament, Gossard and Vedder appeared in Singles under the name "Citizen Dick"; their parts were filmed when Pearl Jam was known as Mookie Blaylock.The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder.[9] While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for "Jeremy", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for "Black" in spite of pressure by the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs, despite it being common knowledge that music videos were one of the most vital sales tools any band had in its arsenal. However, Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed the listener from creating their own interpretation of the song stating that "Before music videos first came out, youd listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and youd come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression."[25] "Ten years from now," Ament said, "I don't want people to remember our songs as videos."[9]Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, "The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy."[26] Released on October 19, 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold 950,378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined.[27] The album set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release, which it held until broken by Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live.[28] Vs. included the singles "Go", "Daughter", "Animal", and "Dissident". Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, "Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than this one did with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut." He added, "Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife."[29] The band decided, beginning with the release of Vs., to scale back its commercial efforts.[30] The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of "Jeremy" and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band "ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans."[31] During the Vs. Tour, the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.[32]By 1994, Pearl Jam was "fighting on all fronts", as its manager described the band at the time.[33] Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Pearl Jam was committed to keeping their concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster, refused to waive the service charge. Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was forced to create from scratch its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas in order to perform. Pearl Jams efforts to organize a tour without the ticket giant collapsed which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmasters monopoly. An analysis of journalist Chuck Philips investigative series[34][35][36][37][38][39] in a well known legal monograph[40] concluded that it was hard to imagine a legitimate reason for Ticketmasters exclusive contracts with venues and contracts which covered such a lengthy period of time. The authors said, The pervasiveness of Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act. The United States Department of Justice was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D.C.[41] Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jams testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. Pearl Jams manager said he was gratified that that Congress recognized the problem as a national issue.[42] The band eventually canceled its 1994 summer tour in protest.[43] After the Justice Department dropped the case, Pearl Jam continued to boycott Ticketmaster, refusing to play venues that had contracts with the company.[44] Music critic Jim DeRogatis noted that along with the Ticketmaster debacle, "the band has refused to release singles or make videos; it has demanded that its albums be released on vinyl; and it wants to be more like its '60s heroes, The Who, releasing two or three albums a year." He also stated that sources said that most of the band's third album Vitalogy was completed by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic or the battle with Ticketmaster were to blame for the delay.[33]Pearl Jam wrote and recorded while touring behind Vs. and the majority of the tracks for its next album, Vitalogy, were recorded during breaks on the tour. Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by this time. Producer Brendan O'Brien said, "Vitalogy was a little strained. I'm being politethere was some imploding going on."[15] After Pearl Jam finished the recording of Vitalogy, drummer Dave Abbruzzese was fired. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, Abbruzzese disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott.[15] He was replaced by Jack Irons, a close friend of Vedder and the former and original drummer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young's 1994 Bridge School Benefit, but he was not officially announced as the band's new drummer until its 1995 Self-Pollution satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour long pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it.[45]Vitalogy was released first on November 22, 1994 on vinyl and then two weeks later on December 6, 1994 on CD and cassette. The CD became the second-fastest-selling in history, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.[12] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that "thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, Vitalogy stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album."[46] Many of the songs on the album appear to be based around the pressures of fame.[47] The song "Spin the Black Circle", an homage to vinyl records, won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock Performance. Vitalogy also included the songs "Not for You", "Corduroy", "Better Man", and "Immortality". "Better Man" (sample (info)), a song originally written and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks there. Considered a "blatantly great pop song" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.[15]The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for Vitalogy, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined in.[48] Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the next three years.[49] Ament later said, "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career."[15] In the same year Pearl Jam backed Neil Young, whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album Mirror Ball. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes.[6] Two songs from the sessions were left off Mirror Ball: "I Got Id" and "Long Road". These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam in the form of the 1995 EP, Merkin Ball.Following the round of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, "Making No Code was all about gaining perspective."[50] Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since Ten,[51] favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that "No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album."[52] The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination,[53] with Ament stating, "In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up."[53] Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles "Who You Are" (sample(helpinfo)), "Hail, Hail", and "Off He Goes". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was "a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time" and that "it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band."[15]Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort between all members of the group, with Ament stating that "everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band."[54] On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound.[55] Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has "turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten."[56] Lyrically, Yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code,[57] with Vedder saying, "What was rage in the past has become reflection."[58] Yield debuted at number two on the Billboard charts, but like No Code soon began dropping down the charts.[59] It included the singles "Given to Fly" and "Wishlist". The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for the song "Do the Evolution" from the album, its first music video since 1992.[60] A documentary detailing the making of Yield, Single Video Theory, was released on VHS and DVD later that year.In April 1998, Pearl Jam once again changed drummers. Jack Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron on an initially temporary basis,[61] but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. Pearl Jam's 1998 Yield Tour in North America marked the bands return to full-scale touring. The band's anti-trust lawsuit against Ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours. Many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be out-of-the-way and impersonal. For this tour and future tours, Pearl Jam once again began using Ticketmaster in order to "better accommodate concertgoers."[62] The 1998 summer tour was a big success,[63] and after it was completed the band released Live on Two Legs, a live album which featured select performances from the tour.In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded "Last Kiss", a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was recorded during a soundcheck and released on the band's 1998 fan club Christmas single. The following year, the cover was put into heavy rotation across the country. By popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999, with all of the proceeds going to the aid of refugees of the Kosovo War.[12] The band also decided to include the song on the 1999 charity compilation album, No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees. "Last Kiss" peaked at number two on the Billboard charts and became the band's highest-charting single.Following its full-scale tour in support of Yield, the band took a short break, but then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new album. On May 16, 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, Binaural. It was drummer Matt Cameron's studio recording debut with the band. The title is a reference to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer Tchad Blake, known for his use of the technique.[64] Binaural was the first album since the band's debut not produced by Brendan O'Brien, although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. Gossard stated that the band members "were ready for a change."[26] Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone said, "Apparently as tired of grunge as everyone except Creed fans, Pearl Jam delve elsewhere." He added, "The album reflects both Pearl Jam's longstanding curse of self-importance and a renewed willingness to be experimental or just plain odd."[65] The album is lyrically darker than the band's previous album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as "pretty sombre."[57] Binaural included the singles "Nothing as It Seems" (sample(helpinfo)), one of the songs featuring binaural recording, and "Light Years". The album sold just over 700,000 copies and became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status.[66]Pearl Jam decided to record every show on its 2000 Binaural Tour professionally, after noting the desire of fans to own a copy of the shows they attended and the popularity of bootleg recordings. The band had been open in the past about allowing fans to make amateur recordings,[67] and these "official bootlegs" were an attempt to provide a more affordable and better quality product for fans.[68] Pearl Jam originally intended to release them to only fan club members, but the band's record contract prevented it from doing so. Pearl Jam released all of the albums in record stores as well as through its fan club. The band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the Billboard 200 at the same time.[69]Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour ended in tragedy on June 30, with an accident at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but it was already too late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event.[70] Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility.[71]A month after the European tour concluded, the band embarked on its two-leg 2000 North American tour. On performing after the Roskilde tragedy, Vedder said that "playing, facing crowds, being togetherit enabled us to start processing it."[15] On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. Vedder took the opportunity to thank the many people who had helped the band come together and make it to ten years. He noted that "I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something."[72] After concluding the Binaural Tour, the band released Touring Band 2000 the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.Following the events of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Vedder and McCready were joined by Neil Young to perform the song "Long Road" from the Merkin Ball EP at the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert. The concert, which aired on September 21, 2001, raised money for the victims and their families.Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as "a pretty positive one" and "very intense and spiritual."[73] Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed."[74] Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles "I Am Mine" and "Save You". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as "Love Boat Captain". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said "Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogya muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours."[75] The track entitled "Arc" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.[76]In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: Perth, Tokyo, State College, Pennsylvania, two shows from Madison Square Garden, and Mansfield, Massachusetts. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed Riot Act's "Bu$hleaguer", a commentary on President George W. Bush, with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had "impaled" the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's Denver, Colorado show.[77]In June 2003, Pearl Jam announced it was officially leaving Epic Records following the end of its contract with the label. The band stated it had "no interest" in signing with another label.[78] The band's first release without a label was the single for "Man of the Hour", in partnership with Amazon.com.[79] Director Tim Burton approached Pearl Jam to request an original song for the soundtrack of his new film, Big Fish. After screening an early print of the film, Pearl Jam recorded the song for him. "Man of the Hour", which was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award, can be heard in the closing credits of Big Fish.The band released Lost Dogs, a two-disc collection of rarities and B-sides, and Live at the Garden, a DVD featuring the band's July 8, 2003 concert at Madison Square Garden through Epic Records in November 2003. In 2004, Pearl Jam released the live album, Live at Benaroya Hall, through a one-album deal with BMG.[80] 2004 marked the first time that Pearl Jam licensed a song for usage in a television show; a snippet of the song "Yellow Ledbetter" was used in the final episode of the television series Friends.[81] Later that year, Epic released rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 19912003), a Pearl Jam greatest hits collection spanning 1991 to 2003. This release marked the end of Pearl Jam's contractual agreement with Epic Records.[82]Pearl Jam played a show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; recordings from the show were compiled for the Live at Easy Street album and released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006. The band embarked on a Canadian cross-country tour in September 2005, kicking off the tour with a fundraising concert in Missoula, Montana for Democratic politician Jon Tester, then playing the Gorge Amphitheater before crossing into Canada. After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a Rolling Stones concert in Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, before closing the tour with a concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The official bootlegs for the band's 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl Jam's official website in MP3 form. Pearl Jam also played a benefit concert to raise money for Hurricane Katrina relief on October 5, 2005, at the House of Blues in Chicago, Illinois. On November 22, 2005, Pearl Jam began its first Latin American tour.[83]The work for Pearl Jam's follow-up to Riot Act began after its appearance on the 2004 Vote for Change tour. The time period between the two albums was the longest gap between Pearl Jam's studio albums to date and the new album was its first release for a new label. Clive Davis announced in February 2006 that Pearl Jam had signed with his label, J Records, which like Epic, is part of Sony Music Entertainment (then known as Sony BMG).[84] The band's eighth studio album, Pearl Jam, was released on May 2, 2006. A number of critics cited Pearl Jam as a return to the band's early sound,[85][86] and McCready compared the new material to Vs. in a 2005 interview.[87] Ament said, "The band playing in a roomthat came across. Theres a kind of immediacy to the record, and thats what we were going for."[88] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly said that "in a world full of boys sent to do a man's job of rocking, Pearl Jam can still pull off gravitas."[89] Current socio-political issues in the United States are addressed on the album. "World Wide Suicide", a song criticizing the Iraq War and U.S. foreign policy, was released as a single and topped the Billboard Modern Rock chart; it was Pearl Jam's first number one on that chart since "Who You Are" in 1996, and first number one on any chart in the United States since 1998 when "Given to Fly" reached number one on the Mainstream Rock chart. Pearl Jam also included the singles "Life Wasted" and "Gone".To support Pearl Jam, the band embarked on its 2006 world tour. It toured North America, Australia and notably Europe; Pearl Jam had not toured the continent for six years. The North American tour included three two-night stands opening for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.[90] The band served as the headliners for the Leeds and Reading festivals, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after Roskilde. Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde had nothing to do with "guts" but with trust in the audience.[91]In 2007, Pearl Jam recorded a cover of The Who's "Love, Reign o'er Me" for the Mike Binder film, Reign Over Me; it was later made available as a music download on the iTunes Music Store.[92] The band embarked on a 13-date European tour, and headlined Lollapalooza in Grant Park, on August 5, 2007.[93] The band released a CD box set in June 2007, entitled Live at the Gorge 05/06, that documents its shows at The Gorge Amphitheatre,[94] and in September 2007 a concert DVD, entitled Immagine in Cornice, which documents the band's Italian shows from its 2006 tour was released.[95]In June 2008, Pearl Jam performed as the headline act at the Bonnaroo Music Festival.[96] The Bonnaroo appearance took place amidst a twelve-date tour in the Eastern United States.[97] In July 2008, the band performed at the VH1 tribute to The Who alongside Foo Fighters, Incubus and The Flaming Lips.[98] In the days prior to Election Day 2008, Pearl Jam digitally released through its official website a free documentary film, entitled Vote for Change? 2004, which follows the band's time spent on the 2004 Vote for Change tour.[99]In March 2009, Ten was reissued in four editions, featuring such extras as a remastering and remix of the entire album by Brendan O'Brien, a DVD of the band's 1992 appearance on MTV Unplugged, and an LP of its September 20, 1992 concert at Magnuson Park in Seattle.[100] It was the first reissue in a planned re-release of Pearl Jam's entire catalog that led up to the band's 20th anniversary in 2011.[100] A Pearl Jam retrospective film directed by Cameron Crowe titled Pearl Jam Twenty[101] was also planned to coincide with the anniversary.[102] In 2011, Vs. and Vitalogy were reissued in the spring time in deluxe form.[101]Pearl Jam began work for the follow-up to Pearl Jam in early 2008.[103] In 2009, the band began to build on instrumental and demo tracks written during 2008.[104] The band's ninth studio album, Backspacer, its first to be produced by Brendan O'Brien since Yield.[103] Backspacer debuted at No.1 on the Billboard music charts, the band's first album to do so since No Code in 1996.[citation needed] The music on the record features a sound influenced by pop and New Wave.[105] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that "prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun."[106] Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now."[107] "The Fixer" was chosen as the album's first single.[108] Pearl Jam did not re-sign its record deal with J Records, and the band released the album through its own label Monkeywrench Records in the United States and through Universal Music Group internationally. Pearl Jam reached a deal with Target to be the exclusive big-box store retailer for the album in the United States. The album also saw release through the band's official website, independent record stores, online retailers, and iTunes.[109][110] In an interview McCready revealed that Pearl Jam may finish the Backspacer outtakes in the next six months,[111] and told San Diego radio station KBZT that the band may release an EP in 2010 consisting of those songs, while Vedder instead suggested that the songs may be used for the band's next studio album.[112]In August 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Virgin Festival,[113] the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival,[114] and played five shows in Europe and three in North America.[115][116][117] In October 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Austin City Limits Music Festival.[118] Later in October on Halloween night, the band played in what was the last performance at the Philadelphia Spectrum. An additional leg consisting of a tour of Oceania took place afterwards.[110] In May 2010, the band embarked on a month long tour starting with the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. The tour headed to the East Coast and ended May 21, 2010 at Madison Square Garden in New York.[119] A European tour took place in June and July 2010, where the band performed in Northern Ireland for the first time at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast.[120] In late October 2010, Pearl Jam performed at the 24th Annual Bridge School Benefit Concert at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California.[121] A live album, titled Live on Ten Legs, was released on January 17, 2011.[122] It is compilation of live tracks from their 2003 to 2010 world tours, and is a follow-up to Live on Two Legs, which consisted of songs recorded during their 1998 North American tour.[123]In March 2011, bassist Jeff Ament told Billboard that the band has 25 songs and they'd be heading into the studio in April to begin recording the follow-up to Backspacer.[124] On May 16, 2011, the band confirmed that they would play the Labor Day weekend at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre, East Troy, Wisconsin, followed by ten shows in Canada.[125]On September 8, 2011, the band released a new song titled "Ol".[126] On November 18, the band released Toronto 9.11.11a free live album available through the launch of Google Music.On November 21, 2011, as part of their PJ20 World Tour, Pearl Jam visited Costa Rica for the first time to a 30,000 crowd of fans at the New National Stadium.[127] The following month, the band announced a tour of Europe, which started in June 2012.[128]Compared with the other grunge bands of the early 1990s, Pearl Jams style is noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the classic rock music of the 1970s.[129] Pearl Jam has cited many punk rock and classic rock bands as influences, including The Who, Neil Young, and the Ramones.[130] Pearl Jams success has been attributed to its sound, which fuses "the riff-heavy stadium rock of the '70s with the grit and anger of '80s post-punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses."[6] Gossard's rhythm guitar style is known for its sense of beat and groove,[131] while McCready's lead guitar style, influenced by artists such as Jimi Hendrix,[132] has been described as "feel-oriented" and "rootsy."[133]Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less catchy. He said, "I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes."[1] By 1994s Vitalogy, the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music.[134] The bands 1996 album, No Code, was a deliberate break from the musical style of Ten. The songs on the album featured elements of garage rock, worldbeat, and experimentalism.[6] After 1998s Yield, which was somewhat of a return to the straightforward rock approach of the band's early work,[55] the band dabbled with experimental art rock on 2000s Binaural and folk rock elements on 2002s Riot Act. The bands 2006 album, Pearl Jam, was cited as a return to the bands early sound.[85][86] The band's 2009 album, Backspacer, contains elements of pop and New Wave.[105]Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a "Jim Morrison-like vocal growl."[135] Greg Prato of Allmusic said, "With his hard-hitting and often confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock."[136] Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal ("Alive", "Better Man") to social and political concerns ("Even Flow", "World Wide Suicide"). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals.[137] When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that."[138]While Nirvana had brought grunge to the mainstream in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam quickly outsold them,[139] and became "the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s" according to Allmusic.[6] Pearl Jam has been described as "modern rock radio's most influential stylists the workmanlike midtempo chug of songs like "Alive" and "Even Flow" just melodic enough to get moshers singing along."[140] The band inspired and influenced a number of bands, ranging from Silverchair to Puddle of Mudd and The Strokes.[141][142] Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries in the grunge scene such as Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden.[1]Pearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic Jim DeRogatis said in the aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that it "proved that a rock band which isn't comprised of greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime... it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll is not the sole province of those '60s bands enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."[143] Eric Weisbard of Spin said in 2001, "The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists."[15] In a 2005 USA Today reader's poll, Pearl Jam was voted the greatest American rock band of all time.[144] In April 2006, Pearl Jam was awarded the prize for "Best Live Act" in Esquire's Esky Music Awards. The blurb called Pearl Jam "the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their last."[145] Pearl Jam's fanbase following has been compared to that of the Grateful Dead's, with Rolling Stone magazine stating that Pearl Jam "toured incessantly and became one of rock's great arena acts, attracting a fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with marathon, true-believer shows in the vanishing spirit of Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2."[1]When asked about Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, "I think at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers werent always easy, but I think we found a way."[146] The band have also been credited for inspiring the indie rock scene of 90s-era urban Pakistan, that has since evolved into a rich rock music culture in the country.[147]Throughout its career, Pearl Jam has promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-choice sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues. The band has promoted an array of causes, including awareness of Crohn's disease, which Mike McCready suffers from, Ticketmaster venue monopolization and the environment and wildlife protection, among others.[148][149] Guitarist Stone Gossard has been active in environmental pursuits, and has been an advocate of Pearl Jam's carbon neutral policy, offsetting the band's environmental impact.[150] Vedder has advocated for the release of the West Memphis 3 for years and Damien Echols, a member of the three, shares a writing credit for the song "Army Reserve" (from Pearl Jam).[151]The band, and especially frontman Eddie Vedder, have been vocal supporters of the pro-choice movement. In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled "Reclamation", which detailed his views on abortion.[152] In an MTV Unplugged concert the same year, Vedder stood on a stool and wrote "PRO-CHOICE!" on his arm in protest when the band performed the song "Porch".[15] The band are members of a number of pro-choice organizations, including Choice USA and Voters for Choice.[149]As members of Rock the Vote and Vote for Change, the band has encouraged voter registration and participation in United States elections. Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000,[153] and Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, supporting the candidacy of John Kerry for U.S. President. In a Rolling Stone feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the magazine, "I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in."[154]Vedder sometimes comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy, and a number of his songs, including "Bu$hleaguer" and "World Wide Suicide", are openly critical of the Bush administration. At Lollapalooza 2007, Vedder spoke out against BP Amoco dumping effluent in Lake Michigan,[155] and at the end of "Daughter", he sang the lyrics "George Bush leave this world alone/George Bush find yourself another home". In the beginning of the second encore Vedder invited Iraq war veteran Tomas Young, the subject of the documentary Body of War, onto the stage to urge an end to the war. Young in turn introduced Ben Harper, who contributed vocals to "No More" and "Rockin' in the Free World".[156] The band has since discovered that some of the Bush-related lyrics were excised from the AT&T webcast of the event, and are questioning whether that constitutes censorship.[157] AT&T later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor Davie Brown Entertainment.[158]Pearl Jam has performed numerous benefit concerts in aid of charities. For example, the band headlined a Seattle concert in 2001 to support the United Nations' efforts to combat world hunger.[159] The band added a date at the Chicago House of Blues to its 2005 tour to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina; the concert proceeds were donated to Habitat for Humanity, the American Red Cross and the Jazz Foundation of America.[160]In 2011, Pearl Jam was named 2011 Planet Defenders by Rock The Earth for their environmental activism and their large-scale efforts to decrease their own carbon emissions.[161]   1 History

Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic musician and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007.[2][3] He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual "100 Bands You Need to Know" issue.[4]After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: "Best Dance/Electronica Album," "Best Dance Recording," and "Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical".[5] On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll.[6] On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year.[7]Moore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles,[8][9] but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of 2, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of 9 and 10, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the time he was 12, his family moved back to his birthplace of northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts. Later he was home schooled at the age of 14 due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted[10] and dropped out of the program when he was 16.[11][12] While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods.[1][13]In 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu.Moore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos ("Signal", "Equinox", and "Glow Worm"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building.After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in "baby blue envelopes", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate.In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards.On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of "Mora" entitled "" ("Kaisui"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables)Moore has stated that the album Bells will not be released.[citation needed]In 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area.[citation needed] Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz.[citation needed] On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download.[14]Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret.[15] Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.Moore kicked off the "Project Blue Book Tour" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled "Bring out the Devil." Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including "First Of The Year" (formerly known as "Equinox"), "Reptile", and "Cinema" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). "Reptile" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and "First of the Year (Equinox)" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites.In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered "Get Up", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made "Get Up" available for free download via their Facebook page.[16] On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011.On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer[17] for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring "Kill EVERYBODY" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.In June 2011, "More Monsters and Sprites" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including "First of the Year (Equinox)" and two versions of his original track "Ruffneck". A leaked track entitled "Ruffneck Bass" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new "Ruffneck" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for "Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011.[18]On August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA.

The Gibson Guitar Corporation is a Nashville, Tennessee-based guitar and instrument manufacturer. It was founded in 1902 in Kalamazoo, Michigan by Orville Gibson as "The Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co., Ltd." and was a maker of mandolin instruments[1]. Gibson invented archtop guitars by using the same type of carved, arched tops found on violins. By the 1930s, the company was also making flattop acoustic guitars, as well as one of the first commercially available hollow-body electric guitars, used and popularized by Charlie Christian. It was bought by Chicago Musical Instruments in 1944, which was then acquired by the E.C.L. conglomerate that changed its name to Norlin Inc. This was seen as the beginning of an era of mismanagement.Gibson sells guitars under a variety of brand names[2] and built one of the world's most iconic guitars, the Gibson Les Paul. Many Gibson instruments are among the most collectible guitars. Gibson was at the forefront of innovation in acoustic guitars, especially in the big band era of the 1930s; the Gibson Super 400 was widely imitated. In the early 1950s, Gibson introduced its first solid-body electric guitar and in 1952 began producing its most popular guitar to datethe Les Paul, designed by Ted McCarty and Les Paul. After being purchased by the Norlin corporation in the late 1960s Gibson's quality and fortunes took a steep decline until early 1986, when the company was acquired by its present owners. Gibson Guitar is a privately held corporation owned by its chief executive officer Henry Juszkiewicz and its president David H. Berryman.Gibson has pursued legal action against manufacturers selling similar guitars and been active in environmental issues. In the late 2000s the company came under scrutiny for potential violations of the Lacey law. Authorities say wood was mislabeled to hide illegal ebony wood exports from India and that emails show an intent to illegally import rosewood and ebony wood from Madagascar. Gibson's CEO claims authorities are bullying him without filing charges. The issues has raised concerns among guitar owners on whether they could be punished for unknowingly owning guitars with illegally obtained wood, which led to some initiatives to protect individual consumers from the Lacey Act. 1920 F-4    1917 H-2
 1924 K-4 mando-celloOrville Gibson (born 1856, Chateaugay, New York) started making mandolins in Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States. The mandolins were distinctive in that they featured a carved, arched solid wood top and back and carved wood sides. Prior to this, mandolins had a flat solid wood top and a bowl-like back similar to a lute. These bowl-back mandolins were very fragile and unstable. Disdainful of the shape, Orville Gibson characterized them as "potato bugs". Gibson's innovation made a distinctive, darker-sounding mandolin that was easier to manufacture in large numbers. Orville Gibson's mandolin design, with its single-pieced carved sides and a single-pieced neck, was patented in 1898; it would be the only innovation he patented. Orville Gibson died in 1918 of endocarditis (inflammation of the inside lining of the heart chambers and valves).[3]Orville Gibson began to sell his unique instruments in 1894 out of a one-room workshop in Kalamazoo Michigan. In 1902 Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co, Ltd. was incorporated to market the instruments. Initially, the company produced only Orville Gibson's original designs. Aware of changing trends, the company hired designer Lloyd Loar in 1919 to create newer instruments.[4]During the 1920s Gibson was responsible for many innovations in banjo, guitar and mandolin design. In 1922, the Gibson F5 mandolin model was introduced. That particular model later became known as the ultimate bluegrass mandolin. Gibson soon became the leading manufacturer of archtop guitars, particularly the L-5 model, also a Loar design. Loar left the company in 1924.[5]In the 1930s, Gibson began exploring the concept of an electric guitar. In 1936 they introduced their first "Electric Spanish" model, the ES-150. Other companies were producing electric guitars but the Gibson is generally recognized as the first commercially successful electric guitar. Other instruments were also "electrified"; such as steel guitars, banjos and mandolins.During World War II, instrument manufacturing basically stopped at Gibson due to shortages of wood and metal. Only a few instruments were made with whatever parts were at hand. Gibson did war production instead, making wood parts for various military needs. Such shortages continued for a few years after the war and the only notable change occurred in 1946 when the Gibson name on the instrument headstock changed from a cursive script to the block style used to this day. This is seen at the head of the information block at top.In 1944 Gibson was purchased by Chicago Musical Instruments, which took over marketing and sales of Gibson products while allowing the Kalamazoo factory to operate largely independently.The ES-175 was introduced in 1949. The model has seen some variations over the years but it is still in production.In 1948, Gibson hired music industry veteran Ted McCarty, who was promoted to company president in 1950. During his tenure (19501966), Gibson greatly expanded and diversified its line of instruments. The first notable addition was the "Les Paul" guitar. McCarty was well aware of the strong sales of the Fender Telecaster. In 1950, Gibson decided to make a solid-body guitar of its own according to its own design philosophy despite the fact many other guitar manufacturers were contemptuous of the concept of a solid-body guitar. Designed by the guitarist Les Paul, it was released as his signature model in 1952. The "Les Paul" was offered in several models, including the Custom, the Standard, the Special, and the Junior.[6]In the mid-50s, the Thinline series was produced. Many guitarists did not like the bulk of a full-size archtop and wanted a thinner guitar. The Byrdland was the first produced. The first Byrdlands were slim, custom built, L-5 models for guitarists Billy Byrd and Hank Garland. Later, a shorter neck was added. Other guitarists who tried Gibson samples liked the idea and the model went into production. Other models such as the ES-350T and the ES-225T were introduced as less costly alternatives.[7]In 1958, Gibson introduced the ES-335T model. Similar in size to the hollow-body Thinlines, the ES-335 family had a solid center, giving the string tone a longer sustain.In the late 50s, McCarty was aware that Gibson was perceived as a "conservative" company, generally making traditionally shaped instruments. He decided to change that. In 1958, Gibson produced two new designs: the eccentrically shaped Explorer and Flying V. These "modernistic" guitars did not sell initially. It was only in the late 1960s and early 70s when the two guitars were reintroduced to the market that they sold very well. The Firebird, in the early 60s, was a reprise of the modernistic idea, though less extreme. In the 1950s, Gibson also produced the Tune-o-matic bridge system and its version of the humbucking pickup, the PAF ("Patent Applied For"), first released in 1957 and still sought after for its sound.[citation needed]In 1961 the body design of the Les Paul was changed due to the demand for a double-cutaway body design.[8] Les Paul did not care for the new body style and let his endorsement lapse. The new body design then became known as the SG (for "solid guitar"). The Les Paul returned to the Gibson catalog in 1968 due to the influence of players such as Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Peter Green. Both the Les Paul and the SG became very popular with rock and roll and blues guitar players.On December 22nd 1969 Gibson parent company, Chicago Musical Instruments, was taken over by a South American brewing conglomerate, E.C.L. Gibson, Inc. remained under the control of CMI until 1974, when it became a subsidiary of Norlin Musical Instruments (a member of Norlin Industries - named for ECL president Norton Stevens and CMI president Maurice Berlin). This began an era widely perceived as being characterized by corporate mismanagement and decreasing product quality similar to Fender's period under CBS ownership.Between 1974 and 1984 production of Gibson guitars was shifted from Kalamazoo to Nashville, Tennessee. Early Nashville-built guitars suffered from both inexperienced workers and climate-control problems in the humid South.[citation needed] The Kalamazoo plant was kept going for a few years as a custom-instrument shop, but was closed in 1984; several Gibson employees led by plant manager Jim Duerloo established Heritage Guitars in the old factory, building versions of classic Gibson designs. The company was within three months of going out of business before it was bought by Henry E. Juszkiewicz, David H. Berryman, and Gary A. Zebrowski in January 1986.[9] The survival and success of Gibson today is largely attributed[by whom?] to this change in ownership.[citation needed] Currently, Juszkiewicz is CEO and Berryman is president. More recently new production plants have been opened, such as Memphis, Tennessee, as well as Bozeman, Montana. The Memphis facility is used for semi-hollow and custom shop instruments, while the Bozeman facility is dedicated to acoustic instruments.In mid 2009 Gibson reduced its work force to adjust for a decline in guitar industry sales in the United States.[10]In 2011, Gibson acquired the Stanton Group, including Cerwin Vega!, KRK Systems and Stanton DJ. Gibson then formed a new division, Gibson Pro Audio, which will deliver professional grade audio items, including headphones, loudspeakers and DJ equipment.[11]Gibson announced a partnership with the Japanese-based Onkyo Corporation in 2012. Onkyo, known for audio equipment and home theater systems, became part of the Gibson Pro Audio division.[12]Gibson also owns and makes instruments under such brands as Baldwin,[2] Epiphone,[13] Kalamazoo,[citation needed] Kramer,[14] Maestro,[15] Slingerland,[2] Steinberger,[16] Tobias,[17] Valley Arts[citation needed] and Wurlitzer.[2]Gibson purchased Garrison Guitars in 2007.[18]Gibson models may not be easily identified by serial number alone,[19][20] and as of 1999 the company has used six distinct serial numbering systems.[19] By 2006, that number had risen to seven.[20]In 1977, Gibson introduced the serial numbering system in use until 2006.[20] An eight digit number on the back shows the date on which the instrument was produced, where it was produced and its order of production that day (e.g. first instrument stamped that day, second, etc.).[19]An exception is the year 1994, Gibson's centennial year; many 1994 serial numbers start with "94", followed by a 6-digit production number[citation needed].The Gibson website provides a book to help with serial number deciphering.[19]In 2006 Gibson introduced a 9 digit serial number system.[20] The system is largely the same as the 8 digit system used since 1977,[19] but the 6th digit now represents a batch number.[20]In 2003,[21] Gibson debuted its ethernet-based[22] communications protocol, MaGIC, which it had developed in partnership with 3COM, Advanced Micro Devices and Xilinx.[21] Replacing traditional analog hook-ups with a digital connection that would, "satisfy the unique requirements of live audio performances" may have been the goal of this project.[22]This system may require a special pickup,[21] but cabling is provided by standard Cat-5 ethernet cord.[21][22]The Gibson "self-tuning guitar", also known as a "robot model", an option on some newer Les Paul, SG, Flying V and Explorer instruments,[citation needed] will tune itself in little more than two seconds using robotics technology developed by Tronical GmbH.[23]Gibson's corporate social responsibility efforts include a participation in Music Rising, which facilitated the replacement of tens of thousands of privately owned, hurricane-damaged instruments.[2]Gibson has sought legal action against those that make and sell guitars too-similar to their own.In 1977 Gibson sued Hoshino/Elger for copying the Gibson Les Paul.[citation needed]In 2000, Gibson sued Fernandes Guitars in a Tokyo court for allegedly copying Gibson designs. Gibson did not prevail.[24]Gibson also sued PRS Guitars in 2005, to stop them from making their Singlecut model. The lawsuit against PRS was initially successful.[25] However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the lower court decision and ordered the dismissal of Gibson's suit against PRS.[26]Gibson makes authorized copies of its most successful guitar designs. They are less expensive than those bearing the Gibson name. A former competitor, Epiphone was purchased by Gibson and now makes competitively priced Gibson models, such as the Les Paul, sold under the Epiphone brand,[27] while continuing to make Epiphone-specific models like the Sheraton and Casino. In Japan, Orville by Gibson once made Gibson designs sold in that country.[28]Gibson has come under scrutiny for importing illegal rare wood in violation of the Lacey Act.[29] Two police raids of Gibson factories found ebony wood from India with misleading labels authorities say were used to hide violations of Indian export law.[29] At the time, Gibson claimed the labeling was a mistake and that the transaction was approved by Indian authorities.[29]On November 17, 2009, federal authorities seized six guitars and several pallets of alleged endangered and illegal, rare ebony wood that Gibson had purchased and stored at their factory.[30][31] During the course of the investigation, Henry E. Juszkiewicz, CEO and Chairman of Gibson Guitar Corporation, took a leave of absence as a board member of the Rainforest Alliance.[32]In January 2011, Gibson Guitar filed a motion to recover the materials seized in the raid and to overturn the charges made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.[33][34] The court denied the motion. According to reports that quote a special agent on the case, the prosecution expected to use the material as evidence.[34]On June 2011, the United States Department of Justice filed a civil case against Gibson. Authorities said Gibson sourced unfinished rosewood and ebony, in the form of blanks, from Nagel, Germany, which obtained it exclusively from a supplier in Madagascar. Gibson acquired the ebony to manufacture fingerboards. Madagascar prohibits the logging of ebony wood and export of unfinished ebony. The filing also mentioned internal e-mails from 2008 and 2009 that discussed plans to harvest ebony wood and rosewood in Madagascar.[35][36] The case against Gibson Guitar was the first under the amended Lacey Act, which requires importing companies to purchase legally harvested wood and follow the environmental laws of the producing countries.[36]Gibson Guitar's offices and factories in Nashville and Memphis were raided again by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife on August 24, 2011. Details were not released about the nature of the raid or what was found due to the ongoing legal proceedings.[30] According to a statement issued by Gibson Guitar the following day, these raids focused on rare wood imported from India.[37][38] In the release, Gibson said authorities were "bullying Gibson without filing charges" and stating further: "Gibson has complied with foreign laws and believes it is innocent of any wrong doing. We will fight aggressively to prove our innocence." He also criticized the government's use of the Lacey Act because it interprets and enforces the laws of other nations.[37][39] The case against Gibson had become popular among right-wing politicians and the Tea Party movement, which fought the environmental legislation.[40]The case was settled on August 6, 2012, with Gibson admitting to violating the Lacey Act and agreeing to pay a fine of $300,000 in addition to a $50,000 community payment. Gibson also forfeited the wood seized in the raids, which was valued at roughly the same amount at the settlement.[40] Had Gibson not settled, it could have also faced felony charges that might have resulted in jail terms for the executives involved.[41] Although the Rainforest Alliance certified the wood used by Gibson Guitar,[36] its FSC certificates only applied to specific product lines. If wood was sourced from Madagascar, the wood could not have been used in products labeled or sold as FSC-certified.[41]The case has also raised concerns for musicians who lack documentation of vintage instruments made of traditional, non-sustainable materials.[29][42] However, senior officials from the Justice Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have stated that musicians who unknowingly possess instruments made from illegal wood would not be treated as criminals. Instead, they insisted that the government's aim is to target individuals and businesses that profit from the trafficking of these protected species. Despite these assurances, lobbying efforts by Juszkiewicz resulted in a proposed bill that would protect musicians who unknowingly possess materials that violate the Lacey Act, while also exempting wood supplies purchased by companies before May 22, 2008, and requiring the government publish a database of illegal wood sources for the public.[43]1 History

Brian Patrick Carroll (born May 13, 1969), better known by his stage name Buckethead, is a virtuoso guitarist and multi instrumentalist who has worked within several genres of music. He has released 40 studio albums, four special releases and one EP. He has performed on over 50 more albums by other artists. His music spans such diverse areas as progressive metal, funk, blues, jazz, bluegrass, ambient, and avant-garde music.Buckethead is famous for wearing a KFC bucket on his head, emblazoned with an orange bumper sticker reading FUNERAL in capital black block letters, and an expressionless plain white mask which, according to Buckethead, was inspired by his seeing Halloween 4.[1] Recently, he changed to a plain white bucket that no longer bore the KFC logo; but subsequently reverted to his trademark KFC bucket. He also incorporates nunchaku and robot dancing into his stage performances.[2][3][4]An instrumentalist, Buckethead has received critical acclaim for his electric guitar playing, and is considered one of the greatest guitarists of all time.[5] He has been voted number 8 on a list in GuitarOne magazine of the "Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time"[6] as well as being included in Guitar World's lists of the "25 all-time weirdest guitarists"[7] and is also known for being in the "50 fastest guitarists of all time list".[8]Buckethead performs primarily as a solo artist. He has collaborated extensively with a wide variety of high profile artists such as Bill Laswell, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, Iggy Pop, Les Claypool, Serj Tankian, Bill Moseley, Mike Patton, Viggo Mortensen, That 1 Guy, and was a member of Guns N' Roses from 2000 to 2004. Buckethead has also written and performed music for major motion pictures, including: Saw II, Ghosts of Mars, Beverly Hills Ninja, Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Last Action Hero, and contributed lead guitar to the track "Firebird" featured on the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie soundtrack.Buckethead began playing guitar at the age of twelve. He had been quoted as saying, however, that he did not become serious until a year later when he moved from Huntington Beach, CA to Claremont, CA. His playing began improving by taking private lessons from various teachers at a local music store, Styles Music. His early teachers included Max McGuire, Johnny Fortune, Mark Hammond, Pebber Brown and Paul Gilbert. Buckethead played a tribute to all his early teachers when the Deli Creeps played a show at Styles Music's 25th anniversary. Buckethead then later began making demo recordings of both his playing as well as his writing styles, which would be released as acoustic albums in the future.In 1988 after leaving the band Class-X, Carroll entered a song called "Brazos" into a Guitar Player magazine contest. It was a runner-up, with editors raving:An astonishingly skilled guitarist and bassist, he demonstrates post-Paul Gilbert speed and accuracy filtered through very kinky harmonic sensibilities. His psychotronic, demonic edge is very, very far removed from the clichs of classical metal and rock. A real talent to watch, also known as "Buckethead."[9]In the same year, the magazine's editor, Jas Obrecht, came to know of Buckethead when Brian and his parents left a demo recording at the magazine's reception desk for Obrecht. Impressed with this demo, he rushed into the restaurant where Buckethead and his parents were having lunch and encouraged him to make the most of his talent.[10] They soon became friends. In 1989 a song called "Soowee" by Buckethead got honorable mention in another song contest. In 1991, Buckethead moved into Obrecht's basement (this is also where the "Buckethead in the Basement" footage for the Young Buckethead DVD was filmed). The song "Brazos" was eventually released on the 1991 demo tape of his band Deli Creeps, titled "Tribal Rites," and again as bonus material in Buckethead's Secret Recipe DVD in 2006. Luke Sacco was his teacher.After his first two demo tapes, called Giant Robot (demo) and Bucketheadland Blueprints, Buckethead released Bucketheadland on John Zorn's Japanese Avant record label in 1992. Though available only as a pricey import, the record received positive reviews and earned some attention. At about this time, Buckethead fell into the orbit of prolific bassist/producer Bill Laswell, himself an occasional Zorn collaborator; Buckethead (as a performer, producer, or composer) was introduced to Laswell with the help of Limbomaniacs drummer Bryan "Brain" Mantia, who gave Laswell a video of Buckethead playing in his room.[11] Buckethead soon became Laswell's second staple guitar player, besides Nicky Skopelitis.In 1992, Buckethead, with Bill Laswell, Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins, and Bryan "Brain" Mantia, formed the supergroup Praxis. Their first album, Transmutation (Mutatis Mutandis), released the same year, was well received. The project was Bill Laswell's concept, and has since involved other guests such as Serj Tankian of System of a Down, among many others. Buckethead did participate in all releases except the initial 1984 release and Mold (1998).In 1994, Buckethead released an album called Dreamatorium under the name of Death Cube K (an anagram of "Buckethead"). The name was created by Tom "Doc" Darter to circumvent legal complications with Sony Music Entertainment. About his style, the official FAQ says,Many believe, however, that Death Cube K is a separate entity that looks like a photographic negative version of Buckethead with a "black chrome mask, like Darth Vader. This apparition haunts Buckethead and appears in his nightmares.[12]Science fiction author William Gibson later borrowed "Death Cube K" as the name of a bar in his novel Idoru (1996). Gibson explained the reference in an interview for Addicted to Noise:Death Cube K is actually the title of an album. I'm sorry I can't remember the name of the group, but Bill Laswell, who I don't really know but out of the kindness of his heart occasionally sends me big hunks of his output, groups that come out on his label. And Death Cube K was the title of some vicious ambient group that he had produced. And when I saw it, I thought: a Franz Kafka theme bar in Tokyo.Also in 1994, Buckethead released his second studio album, Giant Robot, which features many guest appearances by artists such as Iggy Pop and Bill Moseley. The name of the album came from the Japanese series Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot, of which Buckethead is a fan.[13] He also released two other albums with Praxis, their second and third studio efforts: Sacrifist and Metatron.According to Anthony Kiedis' autobiography, Scar Tissue, Buckethead once auditioned in 1993 to play guitar for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, without having heard any of their songs. The band's bassist Flea noted that "When he finished, the band applauded raucously. He was "sweet and normal", but they wanted someone "...who could also kick a groove."[14]The band eventually ended up with guitarist Dave Navarro.In 1995, Buckethead did not release any solo albums but collaborated with several artists like Jonas Hellborg and Michael Shrieve (Octave of the Holy Innocents). He also contributed to several movie soundtracks, such as Johnny Mnemonic and Mortal Kombat.Later, in 1996, Buckethead released his solo album The Day of the Robot with the help of English producer DJ Ninj and Laswell, plus another album with Brain and keyboardist Pete Scaturro on the small Japanese label NTT Records, called Giant Robot. Both albums were printed only in small quantities and are collectors' items now. A second demo tape by the Deli Creeps was also recorded.Also in 1996 several Sega Saturn television ads featuring a screaming mask-like face pressing through the blue orb of the Saturn logo was released, with music by Buckethead.In 1997, Buckethead began working on the album Buckethead Plays Disney, but the album has not yet been released. According to his Web page:This highly anticipated album, once listed in an Avant catalog, has yet to be completed. It is Buckethead's most precious personal project, so he won't record or release it until he knows he is ready.[15]Also in 1997, Buckethead continued to contribute to movie soundtracks, appearing on Beverly Hills Ninja and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, the sequel to Mortal Kombat.Further releases were Arcana's second and final studio album Arc of the Testimony and the one-off project Pieces, with Brain. Two live albums by Praxis, called Transmutation Live and Live in Poland (featuring recordings from European concerts) were also issued.Death Cube K released an album that year called Disembodied.In 1998, Buckethead released Colma, an album dedicated to his mother, who was sick during this time with colon cancer.[16] The same year saw a compilation album by Praxis called Collection.In 1999, Buckethead released his fifth album, a collaboration with Les Claypool from the band Primus, titled Monsters and Robots  currently the best-selling album of his career. This album includes the song "The Ballad of Buckethead," for which his first music video ever was made.[17]Also in this year, he started three new projects, the first being the band Cornbugs, a collaboration with actor Bill Moseley, drummer Pinchface, and later keyboardist Travis Dickerson. Another project, Cobra Strike with an album called The 13th Scroll, featured Pinchface, Bryan "Brain" Mantia, DJ Disk, and Bill Laswell. Buckethead also recorded with actor Viggo Mortensen, whom he first met through a recording project called Myth: Dreams of the World[18] in 1996. Together they released One Man's Meat, One Less Thing to Worry About, and The Other Parade. Those releases are quite rare now, but a compilation album called This, That, and The Other was issued in 2004 to compensate for this. A reworked version of Live in Poland by Praxis, called Warszawa, plus the soundtrack of the movie Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, also came out this year. Furthermore Buckethead offered fans to buy special half-hour long "personalized recordings" for a price of $50 each. Buyers could choose content out of several categories.[19]A third Death Cube K release followed, titled Tunnel, this time without Laswell but featuring Travis Dickerson instead. In 2000, Buckethead released the second and last album by Cobra Strike, called Cobra Strike II - Y, Y+B, X+Y.Buckethead achieved a higher public profile as lead guitarist for Guns N' Roses from 2000 to 2004.[20] He recorded the often-delayed album Chinese Democracy with the band and appeared live on stage in 2001 and 2002, including Rock in Rio 3, MTV's Video Music Awards, and parts of the Chinese Democracy Tour.Despite being a member of GN'R, Buckethead released his sixth studio album, called Somewhere Over the Slaughterhouse in 2001, and also his only EP, called KFC Skin Piles. He also released two albums with his band Cornbugs, Cemetery Pinch and How Now Brown Cow. He joined two new projects, the first being Thanatopsis, with Dickerson, releasing a self-titled debut album; the other one with Laswell and Japanese producer Shin Terai, released as Unison.In 2002, Buckethead released three studio albums: Funnel Weaver, a collection of 49 short tracks, Bermuda Triangle, and finally, Electric Tears, a calming album that is similar to his earlier release, Colma. When Laswell was not able to play with Praxis at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts festival, Les Claypool asked to jam with Brain, Bernie Worrell, and Buckethead, forming a new supergroup called Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains. The jamband experiment was successful enough to do some further live dates.Later, in 2003, marking the release of his tenth studio album, Buckethead released the sequel of his debut Bucketheadland, simply called Bucketheadland 2. Together with actor Viggo Mortensen, he did Pandemoniumfromamerica, and with Thanatopsis, its second release, called Axiology.In March 2004 Buckethead left Guns N' Roses, according to his manager, because of Guns' inability to complete an album or tour.[21]Guns N' Roses' response after Buckethead's departure was as follows:During his tenure with the band, Buckethead has been inconsistent and erratic in both his behavior and his commitment, despite being under contract, creating uncertainty and confusion and making it virtually impossible to move forward with recording, rehearsals, and live plans with confidence. His transient lifestyle has made it near impossible for even his closest friends to have nearly any form of communications with him whatsoever. Axl Rose[22]Since that time, his cult following in the underground music communities has steadily increased. He frequently performs at festivals and in clubs nationwide and often tours as the feature performer.[23][24]The year 2004 saw the release of three new studio albums: Island of Lost Minds, which was his first tour-only album being later re-released by TDRS Music Population Override, a blues-rock tour de force with Dickerson; and The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell, considered his heaviest effort to date. The latter includes "Spokes for the Wheel of Torment," for which Syd Garon and Eric Henry made a music video based on the famous triptychs by Hieronymus Bosch. Buckethead also recorded the final two albums by the Cornbugs, Brain Circus and Donkey Town as well as another release with Viggo Mortensen called Please Tomorrow and a second with Shin Terai, titled Heaven & Hell. C2B3 also released their only album, The Big Eyeball in the Sky, and toured it in North America.In an interview with Revolver, Ozzy Osbourne stated that he had offered to have Buckethead play guitar in his band at Ozzfest. Ozzy quickly changed his mind after meeting with him, and realizing that Buckethead would not remove his costume to be accepted by Ozzy, said:"I tried out that Buckethead guy. I met with him and asked him to work with me, but only if he got rid of the fucking bucket. So I came back a bit later, and he's wearing this green fucking Martian's-hat thing! I said, 'Look, just be yourself.' He told me his name was Brian, so I said that's what I'd call him. He says, 'No one calls me Brian except my mother.' So I said, 'Pretend I'm your mum, then!' I haven't even got out of the room and I'm already playing fucking mind games with the guy. What happens if one day he's gone and there's a note saying, 'I've been beamed up'? Don't get me wrong, he's a great player. He plays like a motherfucker."[25]In 2005, Buckethead released an album as "Buckethead & Friends," called Enter the Chicken, through Serj Tankian's record label, Serjical Strike. The album features Tankian himself, Maximum Bob (of the Deli Creeps), Death by Stereo singer Efrem Shulz, Bad Acid Trip, and others.[26] It is marked by its leaning toward more traditional song structures while still featuring typical Buckethead guitar skills. "We Are One" was released as a single and also appeared on the soundtrack of Masters of Horror. "Three Fingers" was used for the soundtrack of the horror movie Saw II. The final track, "Nottingham Lace," was first made public via his home page and soon became a concert staple and one of his most popular songs. Buckethead also released two further solo albums in 2005, Kaleidoscalp and Inbred Mountain  the latter being the first album as a solo artist released on the label TDRS Music. Both albums originally were sold exclusively at concerts and only later got an official release through the label's website.Also the same year, Buckethead released his first DVD, Secret Recipe, originally sold only on tour; the only places for other fans (those who either didn't go to a show or who lived abroad) to obtain it were auction sites such as eBay. Eventually, Travis Dickerson held a raffle for copies of the DVD on his website. Those who wanted to "win" a copy had to enter their name and e-mail address. When entries were closed, he picked 200 names at random from those who entered, and they were allowed to buy a copy of the DVD from his website. In March 2006, the DVD was finally made widely available.Also, Buckethead released albums with other bands: with Cornbugs, he released two compilation albums, called Rest Home for Robots and Skeleton Farm; he also released (with the band Deli Creeps) their first and only album, called Dawn of the Deli Creeps. Buckethead also released self-titled album Gorgone with studio project Gorgone. This album was recorded from one of the recording sessions from the album Population Override that Buckethead released on 2004. The guitarist also released an album with the actor Viggo Mortensen called Intelligence Failure, and with the band Praxis, released a live album called Zurich.In 2006, the highlight of the year was the cross-console video game Guitar Hero II, featuring Buckethead's song "Jordan" as an unlockable bonus track. Although the song has been performed live in the past, the video game version is the only known studio recording of the song. Also, the live version almost always contains just the verse and chorus of "Jordan"; then goes into another song, usually "Post Office Buddy"; then returns to the verse and chorus of "Jordan." However, the Guitar Hero II version contains a special solo created specifically for the game.[27] Since late 2007, Buckethead has been known to perform the Guitar Hero version of "Jordan" within his concerts, including the solo.Also the same year, Buckethead released two DVDs, titled Young Buckethead Vol. 1 and Young Buckethead Vol. 2, featuring rare footage from 1990 and 1991. The DVD also contains three complete Deli Creeps shows, a sound check, backstage footage, and solo footage of just Buckethead. He also released the albums The Elephant Man's Alarm Clock and Crime Slunk Scene, both sold on his tours but later sold on the TDRS Music website. The last album has the song "Soothsayer (Dedicated to Aunt Suzie)"; this song (along with "Jordan" and "Nottingham Lace") is one of his most popular songs and is often played live.In the same year, Buckethead released his final compilation album with the band Cornbugs, called Celebrity Psychos. He also released an album with producer, keyboardist, and owner of the label TDRS Music, Travis Dickerson, called Chicken Noodles, which was inspired by the track "Cruel Reality of Nature," from the album Population Override. He also released an album with the band Thanatopsis, called Anatomize.In 2007, Buckethead released an unprecedented amount of new material. In February, a box set titled In Search of The, containing 13 albums of original material, was released. It was handcrafted, numbered, and monogrammed by Buckethead and contained over nine hours of music. A regular solo album, called Pepper's Ghost, was released in March. A disc of acoustic improvisations called Acoustic Shards was also released, becoming the twentieth studio album that the artist had released so far in his solo career. In midyear, he reissued his demo tape Bucketheadland Blueprints, with two alternative album covers: a special edition with a hand-drawn cover made by him, or a standard edition with the original cover art. In October, he released his final two albums of the year, called Decoding the Tomb of Bansheebot and Cyborg Slunks. The latter again came in both a hand-drawn limited edition and (some weeks later) as a normal CD.As Death Cube K, Buckethead released two albums in 2007: an album called DCK, limited to 400 hand-numbered copies and released in August; and in December, the 5-CD box set Monolith, which consisted of one unbroken track per CD.[28]During 2007, Buckethead also collaborated and appeared on numerous albums with other artists. The sequel to Chicken Noodles (a collaboration with Travis Dickerson), simply called Chicken Noodles II, was issued by TDRS in December.[29] A live record by Praxis, titled Tennessee 2004; the third album with Shin Terai, called Lightyears; and another album with drummer Bryan Mantia, called Kevin's Noodle House, were also released through the year.Buckethead also created five paintings, each limited to 100 reproductions each and sold through TDRS.[30]That same year, it was revealed that Buckethead joined a project by the name of Science Faxtion, a band featuring bassist Bootsy Collins and drummer Bryan "Brain" Mantia, with Greg Hampton supplying lead vocals. Their first album, called Living on Another Frequency, was delayed several times and was finally released in November 2008.On January 1, 2008, the band Praxis released the long-awaited album Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness) in Japan. The album had actually been recorded in 2005, but had to be put on hold when the original label went bankrupt.2008 started with the release of From the Coop through the label Avabella (where he released Acoustic Shards), consisting of the demos Buckethead gave to Jas Obrecht back in 1988. This CD also included the first ever "official" biography of/by the artist. Later that same year, he announced the release of the album called Albino Slug (a tour-only CD until official release on December of the same year). Along with this album, he appeared on the album The Dragons of Eden, with Dickerson and Mantia, and in collaboration with That 1 Guy as the Frankenstein Brothers, an album called Bolt on Neck was released. That 1 Guy and Buckethead toured together through fall 2008, playing songs from this album.Buckethead also appeared in the documentary American Music: Off the Record, in which he appears only playing.[31] Serj Tankian's label, Serjical Strike, reissued the album Enter the Chicken with an extra song. Furthermore, Buckethead contributed to one track of actor Viggo Mortensen's album At All, and with Travis Dickerson and filmmaker Alix Lambert on the album Running After Deer.Buckethead appeared with Bootsy Collins in Cincinnati, Ohio, to promote the vote for the United States presidential election, 2008 for the organization Rock the Vote.[32] He also joined Collins on Fallen Soldiers Memorial, an album with proceeds going to the National Fallen Heroes Foundation.[33]More than four years after his departure from the band Guns N' Roses, Chinese Democracy was made available. Buckethead appears on all but two songs and was given writing credits on "Shackler's Revenge" (which appeared in the popular video game Rock Band 2); "Scraped"; and "Sorry," which features guest singer Sebastian Bach. The album features eleven of Buckethead's guitar solos.On December 30, 2008, Buckethead released two new tracks via his website to honor the 24th birthday of basketball player LeBron James.[34][35] These tracks were later made available on the album, Slaughterhouse on the Prairie which was released a month later through TDRS Music. Then, in May 2009 he released the album A Real Diamond in the Rough, and later another album called Forensic Follies, which was first sold at some of his tour dates but later released on TDRS.Buckethead released a song in 2009 titled "The Homing Beacon" on his website, along with a drawing of Michael Jackson to serve as a tribute to the late singer after he saw the news of his death. Three years later, the song was released as the final track on Electric Sea, Buckethead's first album of 2012.Following the sound of Forensic Follies, in September he released Needle in a Slunk Stack and a month later he released the long awaited album as Death Cube K, called Torn from Black Space.By the end of the year, on November 13, Gibson announced a Buckethead signature Les Paul.[36] The guitar was part of the series of releases made through the whole month. In December he collaborated on the debut album of Travis Dickerson (founder of the label TDRS Music where he has released many of his albums to date), called Iconography.On February 5, 2010, Buckethead released an album called Shadows Between the Sky and later that month, Gibson released the Buckethead Signature Les Paul.[37]On April 29, 2010, Buckethead's Web site was updated[38] with a picture with the message "Greetings from Bucketheadland... Buckethead wants you to know he appreciates your support all these years, it means so much to him. Buckethead is having some animatronic parts replaced, Slip Disc snuck into the park and caused some mayhem." The reference to Slip Disc is a reference to a Bucketheadland nemesis found on the Bucketheadland album. Bootsy Collins continued to update his Twitter Web site about Buckethead's condition, stating that he had recently gone into therapy for a few months.Nevertheless, after return from injury, on July 15, 2010, Buckethead, along with Brain and Melissa Reese, has released the first volume out of three 5-CD box sets called Best Regards. On August 25, 2010, Buckethead announced his 28th studio album titled Spinal Clock, which showcases his banjo skills. On September 2, 2010, Buckethead released 23 ink drawings that were sold off through TDRS' Web site. A second batch consisting of 67 drawings was released the following week. Along with the drawings, Buckethead auctioned off the three original paintings released in 2007 with two new paintings.In October, two albums in collaboration with Brain were released, the first called Brain as Hamenoodle, and the second installment of the "Regards" series with Brain and Melissa Reese called, Kind Regards. Eventually, both projects were released on October 13.In Mid-October Travis Dickerson announced via the TDRS Music forum,[39] that he has been working on several new projects. One of them turned out to be Left Hanging, an album on which Buckethead is collaborating with him. On October 20, Buckethead released a new album titled Captain EO's Voyage first available only on iTunes. It was later announced that a physical edition will be released on December 1.[40] Eventually, both CD's were released on November 29.[41]On December 20, Buckethead's Web site was updated[38] with a new song and pictures of Rammellzee, a visual artist, graffiti writer, performance artist, hip hop musician, art theoretician and sculptor from New York, with the words "Hero of the Abyss" appearing above the photos. Much speculation had arisen about this new song. It was considered to be a tribute to Rammellzee, as the artist died in his birthplace of Far Rockaway, Queens, New York, on June 28, 2010 at the age of 49.On December 21, Buckethead released a limited-edition album titled Happy Holidays From Buckethead, with a holiday greeting card included.

Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of fourteen to pursue a career in country music. She signed to the independent label Big Machine Records and became the youngest songwriter ever hired by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. The release of Swift's eponymous debut album in 2006 established her as a country music star. "Our Song", her third single, made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number one song on the country chart. She received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2008 Grammy Awards.Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the crossover success of the singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless became the top-selling album of 2009 and was supported by an extensive concert tour. The record won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest ever Album of the Year winner. Swift's third album, 2010's Speak Now, sold over one million copies in its first week of US release and was supported by the thirteen-month Speak Now World Tour. The album's third single, "Mean", won two Grammy Awards. Swift's fourth album, Red, was released in 2012. Its opening US sales of 1.21 million were the highest recorded in a decade, with Swift becoming the only female artist to have two million-plus opening weeks. The lead single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", was Swift's first number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became a worldwide hit. The Red Tour is scheduled to begin in March 2013.Swift is known for her hook-laden, narrative songs about her experiences as a teenager and young adult. As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Swift's other achievements include six Grammy Awards, eleven American Music Awards, seven Country Music Association Awards, six Academy of Country Music Awards and thirteen BMI Awards. She has sold over 26 million albums and 70 million song downloads worldwide. In addition to her music career, Swift has appeared as an actress in the crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2009), the ensemble comedy Valentine's Day (2010) and the animated film The Lorax (2012). Forbes estimates that she is worth over $165 million. As a philanthropist, Swift supports arts education, children's literacy, natural disaster relief, LGBT rights, and charities for sick children.Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989 in Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a Merrill Lynch financial adviser.[2][3] He was raised in Pennsylvania and is the descendant of three generations of bank presidents.[1][4] Her mother, Andrea (ne Finlay), is a homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Andrea spent the first ten years of her life in Singapore, before settling in Texas; her father was an oil rig engineer who worked throughout Southeast Asia.[4] Swift was named after singer James Taylor; her mother believed a gender-neutral name would help her forge a successful business career.[6][7] She has a younger brother, Austin, who attends the University of Notre Dame.[8] She spent the early years of her life on an eleven-acre Christmas tree farm in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania and was educated at the fee-paying Wyndcroft School.[9] When Swift was nine years old, the family moved to Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[10] where she attended West Reading Elementary Center and Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[11] She spent her summers at her parents' vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey and has described it as the place "where most of my childhood memories were formed".[12]Swift's first hobby was English horse riding. Her mother put her in a saddle when she was nine months old; Swift later competed in horse shows.[13][14] Her family owned several Quarter horses and a Shetland pony.[14] At the age of nine, Swift turned her attention to musical theatre and performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions of Grease, Annie, Bye Bye Birdie and The Sound of Music.[15] She traveled regularly to Broadway, New York for vocal and acting lessons. However, "after a few years of auditioning in New York and not getting anything", Swift became interested in country music.[16] She spent her weekends performing at local festivals, fairs, coffeehouses, karaoke contests, garden clubs, Boy Scout meetings and hospitals.[5][17][18] At the age of eleven, after many attempts,[19] Swift won a local talent competition by singing a rendition of LeAnn Rimes's "Big Deal", and was given the opportunity to appear as the opening act for Charlie Daniels at a Strausstown amphitheater.[15] This growing ambition and interest in country music began to isolate Swift from her middle school peers.[1]After watching a Behind the Music episode about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue a music career.[10] She traveled with her mother to Nashville for spring break to leave a demo of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers with record labels along Music Row.[20] She received label rejections and realized that "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different".[21] She began performing the "The Star Spangled Banner" at sporting events because it was an opportunity to "get in front of 20,000 people without even having a record deal".[4] At the age of twelve, Swift was shown by a computer repairman how to play three chords on a guitar, inspiring her to write her first song, "Lucky You".[22] She had previously won a national poetry contest with a poem entitled "Monster in My Closet" but now began to focus on songwriting.[23] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow. With Dymtrow's help, Swift modelled for Abercrombie and Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included in a Maybelline Cosmetics compilation CD and took meetings with major record labels.[24] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, the eight-grader was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville.[25]When Swift was fourteen, her father transferred to the Nashville office of Merrill Lynch and the family relocated to a lake-shore house in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[1] Swift later described this as "an incredible sacrifice" for her family to make.[20] Her parents "presented it as a move to a nice community" rather than as her chance to become a star,[26] and her mother has said, "We've always told her that this is not about putting food on our table or making our dreams come true."[27] In Tennessee, Swift attended Hendersonville High School for her freshman and sophomore years.[28] Later, to accommodate her touring schedule, Swift transferred to the Aaron Academy, a private Christian school which offered homeschooling services. She earned her high school diploma in 2008, having finished her final two years of course work in twelve months.[29][30]Swift moved to Nashville at the age of fourteen. As part of her artist development deal with RCA Records, she had writing sessions with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally and The Warren Brothers.[31][32] She eventually formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[33] Swift saw Rose performing at an RCA songwriter event and suggested that they write together.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose has said that the sessions were "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks".[36] Swift also began recording demos with producer Nathan Chapman.[34] After performing at a BMI Songwriter's Circle showcase at The Bitter End, New York,[32] Swift became the youngest songwriter ever hired by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house.[37] She left RCA Records when she was fifteen; the company wanted her to record the work of other songwriters and wait until she was eighteen to release an album, but she felt ready to launch her career with her own material.[19][38] She also parted ways with manager Dan Dymtrow, who later took legal action against Swift and her parents.[24] "'I genuinely felt that I was running out of time," Swift later recalled. "I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."[39] At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Caf in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a Dreamworks Records executive who was preparing to form his own independent record label, Big Machine Records. She became one of the label's first signings,[33] with her father purchasing a three per cent stake in the fledgling company.[40] As an introduction to the country music business, Borchetta arranged for Swift to intern as an artist escort at the CMA Music Festival.[41]Swift began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after signing her record deal. After experimenting with veteran Nashville producers, Swift persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman. It was his first time to record a studio album but Swift felt they had the right "chemistry".[19] In the end, Chapman produced all but one of the tracks on Taylor Swift. She has described the album as the "diary" of her early teens.[42] She has said that, although "it sounds like I've had 500 boyfriends", a lot of the songs are observational.[19] Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, including two singles, and co-wrote the remaining eight with writers such as Liz Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall and Angelo Petraglia.[43] Musically, the album has been described as "a mix of trad-country instruments and spry rock guitars".[44] Taylor Swift was released in October 2006. The New York Times described it as "a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice."[45] PopMatters hoped Swift would be "able to find an accomodation between the country tradition and her very obvious pop sensibilities, because Taylor Swift suggests she has much to offer".[46] The New Yorker's Sasha Frere-Jones described Swift as a "prodigy". He noted that "Our Song" "stop[ed] me in my tracks" and praised the lyrics: "He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel, the other on my heart".[47] Country Weekly felt that "the more thoughtful material suggests a talent poised to last well past high school".[48] Rolling Stone described Swift as "bright-eyed but remarkably seasoned", and admired "Our Song"'s "insanely hooky sing-song melody that's as Britney as it is Patsy".[44]Big Machine Records was still in its infancy upon the release of the lead single "Tim McGraw" in June 2006, and Swift and her mother helped "stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio".[27] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift in a radio tour and later commented, "Radio tours for most artists last six weeks. Mine lasted six months."[19] Swift baked cookies and painted canvases (inspired by Jackson Pollock) to gift to radio station programmers who played her music.[49] She made many television appearances, including on the Grand Ole Opry,[50] Good Morning America,[51] and TRL.[52] She also signed endorsement deals, appearing as a spokesmodel for l.e.i. jeans and as the face of Verizon Wireless' Mobile Music campaign.[53][54] Swift, a self-described "kid of the internet", used MySpace to build a fanbase.[55] She wrote her own blog posts, left comments on her fans' accounts and personally respond to the messages that were sent to her.[56] This was, at the time, "revolutionary in country music".[57] Borchetta has said that his decision to sign a sixteen-year-old singer-songwriter initially raised eyebrows among his record industry peers but Swift tapped into a previously unknown market: teenage girls who listen to country music.[57] Following "Tim McGraw", four further singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn" and "Should've Said No". All were highly successful on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, with "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" both reaching number one. "Our Song" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number one country song.[58] "Teardrops on My Guitar" became a minor pop hit; it reached number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100.[59] The album sold 39,000 copies during its first week of release[60] and, as of March 2011, has sold over 5.5 million copies worldwide.[61] Swift also released a holiday album, Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection, in October 2007 and an EP, Beautiful Eyes, in July 2008.[62][63]Swift toured extensively in support of Taylor Swift. In addition to festival and theater dates, Swift performed as an opening act for several country artists' concert tours. In late 2006, she opened for Rascal Flatts on the final nine dates of their Me & My Gang Tour, after the previous supporting act Eric Church was fired.[51] Swift later sent Church her first gold record with a note: "Thanks for playing too long and too loud on the Flatts tour. I sincerely appreciate it. Taylor".[64] In 2007, she served as the opening act on twenty dates for George Strait's tour,[65] several dates on Kenny Chesney's Flip-Flop Summer Tour,[66] selected dates on Brad Paisley's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour[67] and several dates for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's joint Soul2Soul II Tour.[68] Swift again opened for Rascal Flatts on their Still Feels Good Tour in 2008.[69] In addition to performing her own material, Swift played covers of songs by Beyonc, Rihanna, John Waite, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Eminem.[70][71][72] She conducted meet-and-greet sessions with fans before and after her concerts; these lasted for up to four hours.[73]In 2007, Swift and Alan Jackson were jointly named the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year. Swift was the youngest person ever to be honored with the title.[74] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist.[75] In 2008, she was named Top New Female Vocalist at the Academy of Country Music Awards[76] and Favorite Country Female Artist at the American Music Awards.[77] She received seven BMI Awards for songs featured on Taylor Swift.[78] Swift was also nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award in the category of Best New Artist, but lost to Amy Winehouse.[79]Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released in November 2008. Swift wrote seven of the album's songs alone, including two singles, and co-wrote the remaining six with songwriters Liz Rose, John Rich, Colbie Caillat and Hillary Lindsey.[80] She co-produced the album with Nathan Chapman.[80] Musically, it has been said that the record is characterized by "loud, lean guitars and rousing choruses", with the occasional "bit of fiddle and banjo tucked into the mix".[81] The New York Times described Swift as "one of pop's finest songwriters, country's foremost pragmatist and more in touch with her inner life than most adults".[82] The Village Voice felt she displayed "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness", "masterfully avoiding the typical diarist's pitfalls of trite banality and pseudo-profound bullshit".[83] Rolling Stone described her as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture" whose "squirmingly intimate and true" songs seemed to be "literally ripped from a suburban girl's diary".[81] USA Today found it "a pleasure to hear a gifted teenager who sounds like a gifted teenager, rather than a mouthpiece for a bunch of older pros' collective notion of adolescent yearning."[84] The New Yorker described it as an album "without a bad track", adding that "the album's finest effort, "Fifteen", will feature in yearbook quotes for years".[85] Entertainment Weekly noted that the album would appeal mainly to young girls  "she sounds like a real teen, not some manufactured vixen-Lolita"  but predicted it would be "exciting to watch her precocious talent grow".[86] Music critic Robert Christgau described Swift as "an uncommonly-to-impossibly strong and gifted teenage girl".[87]Swift promoted Fearless heavily upon its release. An episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show was dedicated to the album launch[57] and Swift appeared on many other chat shows.[88] She communicated with fans using social media platforms such as Twitter and personal video blogs.[57] She launched a l.e.i. sundress range at Wal-Mart,[89] as well as a line of American Greetings cards and Jakks Pacific dolls.[90][91] She became a spokesperson for the NHL's Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras,[92][93] and performed in a commercial for the Band Hero video game, with Rivers Cuomo, Pete Wentz and Travis Barker appearing as her backing band.[94] The singer paid tribute to a number of fellow artists in televised performances: she performed a cover of Alan Jackson's "Drive (For Daddy Gene)" at the CMT Giants: Alan Jackson event,[95] took part in a joint, televised concert with rock band Def Leppard in Nashville,[96][97] and performed a cover of George Strait's "Run" at a televised ACM event honoring Strait as the Artist of the Decade.[98] Swift sang her song "Fifteen" with Miley Cyrus at the 51st Grammy Awards,[99] performed a self-penned rap skit with T-Pain at the CMT Awards[100] and hosted Saturday Night Live.[101] The lead single from the album, "Love Story", was released in September 2008 and became the second best-selling country single of all time, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[102] Four more singles were released throughout 2008 and 2009: "White Horse", "You Belong with Me", "Fifteen" and "Fearless". "You Belong with Me" was the album's highest-charting single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[103] The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Album Chart with sales of 592,304 and has since sold over 8.6 million copies worldwide.[104] It was the top-selling album of 2009 and brought Swift much crossover success.[105]Swift carried out her first headlining tour from April 2009 to June 2010. As part of the 105-date Fearless Tour, Swift played 90 dates in North America, six dates in Europe, eight dates in Australia and one date in Asia.[106] The elaborate stage set included a fairy-tale castle and a high school bandstand.[107] She sang a cover of Justin Timberlake's "What Goes Around... Comes Around" nightly, intertwined with her own "You're Not Sorry".[108] Swift invited John Mayer, Faith Hill and Katy Perry to perform one-off duets with her at various dates during the North American tour.[109][110][111] Justin Bieber, Kellie Pickler and Gloriana were the support acts.[112] The tour was attended by more than 1.1 million fans and grossed over $63 million.[113] Taylor Swift: Journey to Fearless, a concert film, was aired on television and later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[114] Also in 2009, Swift performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban's Escape Together World Tour.[115]In September 2009, Swift became the first country music artist to win an MTV Video Music Award when "You Belong with Me" was named Best Female Video.[116] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West, who had been involved in a number of other award show incidents.[117] West declared Beyonc's video for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", nominated in the same category, to be "one of the best videos of all time." Many audience members booed West,[118] prompting him to flip off the crowd.[119] He then handed the microphone back to a speechless Swift.[118] Backstage, Swift was seen "hysterically crying".[118] According to Rolling Stone, when Swift's mother confronted West, he gave "a half-hearted apology in which he added he still thought Beyonc's video was superior".[120] West was removed from the event.[118] When Beyonc later won the award for Video of the Year, she invited Swift onstage to finish her speech.[118] In the event's press room, Swift, who in 2008 had expressed a desire to sing a hook on a Kanye West rap song,[121] was asked if she had "any hard feelings" towards West: "I don't know him, and I've never met him, so... I don't want to start anything because I had a great night tonight."[120][122] The incident received much media attention and inspired many Internet memes.[123] President Barack Obama, in an off the record comment, called West a "jackass".[124] Former US President Jimmy Carter said West's interruption was "completely uncalled for".[125] West's behavior was criticized by celebrities, including Eminem, Snoop Dogg and Madonna.[126][127][128] West apologized for his verbal outburst in two blog entries and during an appearance on The Jay Leno Show.[118][129] He maintained that, while Swift was "very talented", "Beyonc's video was the best of this decade!!!! ... I gave my awards to Outkast when they deserved it over me ... I'm not crazy y'all, I'm just real."[130] Two days after the VMAs, Swift told an interviewer that West had not spoken to her since the ceremony.[131] West then contacted her to offer a personal apology, which Swift accepted: "Kanye did call me, and he was very sincere in his apology."[116] She refused to discuss the incident in subsequent interviews so as not to make a "bigger deal" of it: "It happened on TV, so everybody saw what happened ... It's not something I feel like we need to keep talking about."[132] It has been said that the incident and subsequent media attention turned Swift into "a bona-fide mainstream celebrity".[133]Swift released a cover of Tom Petty's "American Girl" through Rhapsody in June 2009[134] and continues to make her stage entrance to Petty's recording of the song.[135] She contributed backing vocals to John Mayer's "Half of My Heart", a single featured on his fourth album, in November 2009. Mayer wrote the song as a tribute to Tom Petty and Fleetwood Mac: "I thought, 'Well, if this is going to be my love letter to that style of music, who's going to be the Stevie Nicks in this equation?' And I thought, 'This Taylor Swift girl is going to be around for a long time."[136] Swift collaborated with a number of other artists in 2008 and 2009. She co-wrote and recorded "Best Days of Your Life" with Kellie Pickler.[137] She co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack  "You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" and "Crazier"  with Martin Johnson and Robert Ellis Orrall, respectively.[138] Swift also provided vocals for Boys Like Girls's "Two Is Better Than One", written by Martin Johnson.[139] In January 2010, Swift contributed two songs  including "Today Was a Fairytale"  to the Valentine's Day soundtrack[140] and recorded a cover of Better Than Ezra's "Breathless" for the Hope for Haiti Now album.[141]Swift won four Grammy Awards in January 2010, from a total of eight nominations.[142] Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, while "White Horse" was named Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[143] She was the youngest ever artist to win Album of the Year.[144] During the ceremony, Swift sang "Rhiannon" and "You Belong with Me" with Stevie Nicks. Her vocal performance received negative reviews and sparked a widespread media backlash.[133][145] Her vocals were described variously as "badly off-key", "strikingly bad" and "incredibly wretched".[146][147] While The New York Times found it "refreshing to see someone so gifted make the occasional flub" and described Swift as "the most important new pop star of the past few years",[144] music analyst Bob Lefsetz predicted that her career would end "overnight" and publicly appealed to Swift's father to hire a "crisis publicity agent" to manage the story because "Taylor's too young and dumb to understand the mistake she made".[148][149] In April 2010, Stevie Nicks, writing in Time, defended the singer: "Taylor reminds me of myself in her determination and her childlike nature. It's an innocence that's so special and so rare. This girl writes the songs that make the whole world sing, like Neil Diamond or Elton John ... The female rock-'n'-roll-country-pop songwriter is back, and her name is Taylor Swift. And it's women like her who are going to save the music business."[150] Fearless won many other accolades and has become the most awarded album in country music history.[151] Swift became the youngest ever artist and one of only six women to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association.[152] Fearless also won the Association's Album of the Year award.[152] She was the youngest ever artist to win the Academy of Country Music's Album of the Year honor.[153] The American Music Awards honored Swift with Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album plaudits.[154] She was awarded the Hal David Starlight Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame[155] and was named Songwriter/Artists of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association.[156] She won four BMI Awards.[157] Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year.[158] Swift was included in Time's annual list of the 100 Most Influential People in 2010.[150]Swift released her third studio album, Speak Now, in October 2010. She wrote all twelve songs alone.[159] Swift, who co-produced the record with longtime collaborator Nathan Chapman,[160] has described it as "a collection of confessionsthings I wish I had said when I was in the moment".[161] She originally intended to call the album Enchanted but Scott Borchetta, her record label's CEO, felt the title did not reflect the album's more adult themes.[162] Musically, it has been said that the album "expands beyond country-pop to border both alternative rock and dirty bubblegum pop".[163] USA Today felt that Swift's songwriting skills would remind listeners "what all the fuss was about in the first place", with the album capturing "the sweet ache of becoming an adult".[164] The Los Angeles Times praised her ability as a songwriter to "hit on common experiences that feel unique".[163] The New York Times described the album as savage, musically diverse and "excellent too, possibly her best".[160] The Village Voice found that the album demanded "a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic: Like a procession of country songwriters before her, she creates characters and situationssome from lifeand finds potent ways to describe them."[165] Entertainment Weekly noted that, while love may confound her, "the art of expert songcraft clearly doesn't".[166] Music critic John Christgau found the album's songs "overlong and overworked" but remarked that "they evince an effort that bears a remarkable resemblance to carethat is, to caring in the best, broadest, and most emotional sense".[87] Rolling Stone described Swift as one of the best songwriters in "pop, rock or country": "Swift might be a clever Nashville pro who knows all the hitmaking tricks, but she's also a high-strung, hyper-romantic gal with a melodramatic streak the size of the Atchafalaya Swamp".[167]Swift carried out an extensive promotional campaign prior to Speak Now's release.[168] She appeared on various talk shows and morning shows, and gave free mini-concerts in unusual locations, including an open-decker bus on Hollywood Boulevard and a departure lounge at JFK airport.[169][170] She took part in a "guitar pull" alongside Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, Vince Gill and Lionel Ritchie at LA's Club Nokia; the musicians shared the stage and took turns introducing and playing acoustic versions of their songs to raise money for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.[171][172] In addition to her pre-existing Sony Electronics and American Greetings endorsements, Swift also became a CoverGirl spokesmodel,[173] launched an Elizabeth Arden fragrance entitled Wonderstruck[174] and released a special edition of Speak Now through Target.[175] The album's lead single, "Mine", was released in August 2010 and five further singles were released throughout 2010 and 2011: "Back to December", "Mean", "The Story of Us", "Sparks Fly" and "Ours".[176] Speak Now was a major commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. Its sales of 1,047,000 copies made it the sixteenth album in US history to sell one million copies in a single week.[177] As of February 2012, Speak Now has sold over 5.7 million copies worldwide.[178][179]In September 2010, Kanye West used his Twitter account to apologize to Swift for his 2009 VMA interruption, referring to her as "just a lil girl with dreams like the rest of us": "I wrote a song for Taylor Swift that's so beautiful and I want her to have it. If she won't take it then I'll perform it for her."[180] At the 2010 VMAs later that month, Swift sang "Innocent", a song widely believed to be about West, which The Washington Post described as "a small masterpiece of passive aggressiveness, a vivisection dressed up as a peace offering".[181] Music critics found Swift's performance overly serious and "petty".[182][183] In October 2010, West remarked that it was "inaccurate" for Swift's Fearless to have been named Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards earlier that year.[184] Speaking in November 2010, West said he failed to see what was "so arrogant" about his VMA interruption and described his actions as "selfless".[185][186] He argued it was "just disrespectful" and "retarded" for Swift to be included in the same award category as Beyonc.[187] He added that "if it was the other way around" and Swift were an established artist who had "made the video of her career, do you think she would have lost to a brand new artist? Hell no!"[185][186] He claimed that his interruption caused Swift to "have 100 magazine covers and sell a million first week".[187] Also that month, he claimed that, "If I wasn't drunk, I would have been on stage longer ... Taylor never came to my defense at any interview. And rode the waves and rode it and rode it".[188][189] At the Costume Institute Gala in May 2011, Swift and West came face-to-face on the red carpet. West was observed to hold "a hand out, and the two exchanged a studiedly casual, "down low" high five".[1]Swift toured throughout 2011 and early 2012 in support of Speak Now. As part of the thirteen-month, 111-date world tour, Swift played seven shows in Asia, twelve shows in Europe, 80 shows in North America and twelve shows in Australasia.[190] The stage show was inspired by Broadway musical theatre, with choreographed routines, elaborate set-pieces, pyrotechnics and numerous costume changes.[191][192] Swift invited many musicians to join her for one-off duets during the North American tour. Appearances were made by James Taylor, Jason Mraz, Shawn Colvin, Johnny Rzeznik, Andy Grammer, Tal Bachman, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Nicki Minaj, Nelly, B.o.B, Usher, Flo Rida, T.I., Jon Foreman, Jim Adkins, Hayley Williams, Hot Chelle Rae, Ronnie Dunn, Darius Rucker, Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney.[193][194] During the North American tour leg, Swift wrote different song lyrics on her left arm for each performance and has said that the lyrics should be viewed as a nightly "mood ring".[195][196] Swift performed many acoustic cover versions during her North American tour. In each city, she paid tribute to a homegrown artist.[197] She has said the cover versions allowed her to be "spontaneous" in an otherwise well-rehearsed show.[198] The tour was attended by over 1.6 million fans and grossed over $123 million.[190] Swift's first live album, Speak Now World Tour: Live, featuring all seventeen performances from the North American leg of the tour, was released in November 2011.[199] In July 2012, James Taylor invited Swift to appear as a special guest during his Tanglewood set; they performed "Fire and Rain", "Love Story" and "Ours" together.[200] Taylor, who first met Swift when she was eighteen, has said that, "we just hit it off. I loved her songs, and her presence on stage was so great".[201][202]At the 54th Grammy Awards in February 2012, Swift's song "Mean" won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.[203] She also performed the song during the ceremony. Bob Lefsetz, one of the most vocal critics of her 2010 Grammy performance, believes the song is addressed to him.[204][205] Lefsetz had previously been a supporter of the singer's career,[206] and Swift and Lefsetz had corresponded occasionally by email and telephone.[204] Time felt she "delivered her comeback on-key and with a vengeance"[207] while USA Today remarked that the criticism in 2010 seemed to have "made her a better songwriter and live performer".[208] Swift was named Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association in both 2010 and 2011.[209][210] Swift won various other awards for Speak Now. She was named Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in both 2011 and 2012[211] and was named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association in 2011.[212] Swift was the American Music Awards's Artist of the Year in 2011, and Speak Now was named Favorite Country Album.[213] She was also the recipient of three BMI Awards.[214] Billboard named Swift 2011's Woman of the Year.[215] Also that year, Billboard ranked her at number 15 in a list of the Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters 20002011; she was the second highest ranking woman.[216] Swift was ranked second on Rolling Stone's list of the Top 16 "Queen Of Pops" of the decade.[217]Swift contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album in March 2012. "Safe & Sound" was co-written and recorded with The Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett.[218] John Paul White has said working with Swift was "a revelation. She had some great ideas. We had complete freedom. It truly was a collaboration. We brought the melancholy and the darker angle. Taylor was bringing the melody and the chords."[219] Rolling Stone described the song as "Swift's prettiest ballad" and wondered whether the alt-country folk song was "a one-off novelty, a trial balloon cred-move, or the stirrings of a "grown-up" style".[220] Swift and The Civil Wars debuted a live version of the song at the Ryman Auditorium, Nashville in January 2012.[221] It was released as the album's lead single and, as of July 2012, has sold over one million copies in the United States.[222] Swift's second contribution to the album, "Eyes Open", was written solely by the singer and produced by Nathan Chapman.[223] In May 2012, Swift contributed vocals to "Both of Us", a Dr. Luke-produced single from B.o.B's second album Strange Clouds.[224]Swift's fourth studio album, Red, was released in October 2012.[225] She wrote nine of the album's sixteen songs alone; the remaining seven were co-written with Max Martin, Liz Rose, Dan Wilson, Ed Sheeran and Gary Lightbody. Nathan Chapman served as the album's lead producer but Jeff Bhasker, Butch Walker, Jacknife Lee, Dann Huff and Shellback also produced individual tracks. Chapman has said he encouraged Swift "to branch out and to test herself in other situations".[226] She has described the collaborative process as "an apprenticeship" which taught her to "paint with different colors".[226][227] Red examines Swift's attraction to drama-filled relationships; she believes that, since writing the record, such relationships no longer appeal to her.[226] Musically, while there is experimentation with "slick, electronic beats", it is "limited to a handful of tracks sprinkled among more recognisably Swiftian fare".[228] The Guardian described Swift as a "Brnnhilde of a rockstar" and the album as "another chapter in one of the finest fantasies pop music has ever constructed."[229] The New York Times considered it as "a transitional album" in which Swift addresses her sexual life and own culpability in relationships.[230] The Times praised her "sublime" lyrics, particularly those on the "brooding" "All Too Well".[231] Rolling Stone enjoyed "watching Swift find her pony-footing on Great Songwriter Mountain. She often succeeds in joining the Joni/Carole King tradition of stark-relief emotional mapping ... Her self-discovery project is one of the best stories in pop."[232] However, Salon asserted that, "more than the token Serious Female Singer Songwriters (Joni Mitchell, Lucinda Williams, Carole King,) Swift reminds me of masters of quirky pop sincerity like Alex Chilton and Jonathan Richman."[233]As part of the Red promotional campaign, representatives from 72 worldwide radio stations were flown to Nashville during release week for individual interviews with Swift.[234] She also appeared on many television chat shows and performed at award ceremonies in the US, the UK, Germany and Australia.[235] Swift offered exclusive album promotions through Target,[236] Papa John's[234] and Walgreens.[237] She became a spokesmodel for Keds sneakers,[238] released her sophomore Elizabeth Arden fragrance,[239] and continued her partnerships with Covergirl, Sony Electronics and American Greetings, as well as her unofficial brand tie-ins with Ralph Lauren and Shellys.[240] The album's lead single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", was released in August 2012. The song became Swift's first number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, recording the highest ever one-week sales figures for a female artist.[241] Two further singles have been released: "Begin Again" (to country radio) and "I Knew You Were Trouble" (to pop and international radio).[242][243] Red debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21 million copies; this marked the highest opening sales in a decade and made Swift the first female to have two million-selling album openings.[244] The album also topped international sales charts in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Japan, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand.[245] As of November 2012, Red had sold 2.8 million copies worldwide.[246] In her career, as of November 2012, she had sold in excess of 26 million albums and 75 million song downloads.[246] Swift will embark on the first leg of the Red Tour from March to September 2013, which will see her play 62 dates across North America.[247][246]Swift won three MTV Europe Music Awards in 2012, including the honors for Best Female and Best Live Act.[248] She was named Best Female Country Artist at the 2012 American Music Awards.[249] The Nashville Songwriters Association's 2012 Songwriter/Artist Award went to Swift for the fifth year in a row.[250]One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (ne Moehlenkamp), sing.[9] In her youth, Finlay was a recording star in Puerto Rico and performed in operas in Singapore: "She was in The Bartered Bride, The Barber of Seville and musicals like West Side Story".[4] As a very young child, Swift enjoyed Disney movie soundtracks: "My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own".[20][251] Later, her parents exposed her to artists including James Taylor, Simon & Garfunkel and Def Leppard.[252][253] Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child: "We would stay up that whole night before, just practicing different things to say."[254] She also attributes her "fascination with writing and storytelling" to her mother: "When I was little, she would indulge my imagination and tell me stories."[255] Swift enjoyed both reading and writing poetry and was particularly drawn to the works of Shel Silverstein and Dr. Seuss.[4][256] She remains interested "in any writing from a child's perspective" and has cited To Kill a Mockingbird as one of her favorite books.[49]Swift was introduced to country music by "the great female country artists of the '90s ... Shania, Faith, the Dixie Chicks".[70][26] Those three artists "really sealed the deal" for Swift and she became "infatuated with the sound, with the storytelling" of country music.[9][257] Shania Twain was her biggest musical influence: "She was just so strong and so independent and wrote all her own songs".[258] As an artist, Swift has said she "can only aspire to be like her" and, in 2009, she named Twain's Come On Over as her favorite album.[259][260] She has spent time with Twain,[261] who later expressed an interest in writing with the younger singer.[262] Faith Hill was Swift's childhood role model and she tried to copy "everything she said, did, wore".[263][264] She admired Hill for "taking country music to bigger audiences, and her grace in the spotlight".[263] Hill has become a "welcoming and warm presence" in Swift's life since her rise to fame.[263] On one occasion, Hill and her husband Tim McGraw gave Swift the use of their Los Angeles house while she was working in the area.[265] Swift admired the Dixie Chicks's "we don't care what you think" attitude and was inspired by the way they played their own instruments.[4][266] The band's "Cowboy Take Me Away" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.[267] LeAnn Rimes served as another introduction to country music.[4] Swift found it "motivating" to observe another young artist find success.[268] She then began to explore the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton.[4][269] Lynn's "Fist City" is one of Swift's favorite country songs.[4] She has said Parton is "an amazing example to every female songwriter out there ... There's so much about Dolly Parton that every female artist should look to".[264] She respects Kenny Chesney, particularly from "a business standpoint": "He's one of the only artists playing stadiums ... He's always been a huge hero of mine".[263][264] Other mainstream country influences include George Strait,[4] Garth Brooks,[70] Reba McEntire,[270] Alan Jackson,[4] Martina McBride,[271] Tim McGraw[272] and Brad Paisley.[273] Swift also admires alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams,[274] Patty Griffin,[275] Lori McKenna[276] and Bon Iver.[277]Swift has been influenced by many artists outside the country genre.[278] As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson,[279] the Backstreet Boys[280] and Britney Spears; she still has "unwavering devotion" for Spears.[281] In her high school years, Swift listened to emo bands such as Dashboard Confessional,[282] Fall Out Boy,[283] The All-American Rejects,[284] Death Cab for Cutie[285] and Jimmy Eat World.[286] She was also a fan of female singer-songwriters including Michelle Branch,[286] Pink,[287] Alanis Morisette,[288] Ashlee Simpson,[289] Kelly Clarkson,[280] Fefe Dobson[286] and Avril Lavigne.[280] Swift closely followed the musical supervision on the television dramas The O.C. and Grey's Anatomy, downloading "every" song featured.[277][290] She was a fan of hip hop music, particularly the rhyming patterns used by artists such as Eminem: "Country and hip-hop are two of the most honest genres because we just like to sing about our lifestyle ... Pride is something that both country and hip-hop share".[4] Swift also drew inspiration from the catalogues of veteran artists. Tom Petty, she has said, "is on a pedestal for me".[14] She is "obsessed" with Sixties acts like The Shirelles, Doris Troy and The Beach Boys,[196][284] and admires Bon Jovi because "there's just a melodic stickiness to their songs that I've always been drawn to".[196] Influence also came from older female pop rock singers including Pat Benatar,[280][291] Stevie Nicks,[291] Melissa Etheridge,[291] Sarah McLachlan,[288] Sheryl Crow[292] and Shawn Colvin.[293]Swift lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models: "They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers."[294][295][296] McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel "as if I've been let into his heart and his mind": "Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that."[297] She admires Springsteen because he is "so musically relevant after such a long period of time".[298] Swift says of Kristofferson: "He shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out".[299]Neil Young describes Swift as "a great writer": "I like listening to her. I kind of like watching her respond to all the attacks. I like the ways she's defining herself. So I keep my eye on it".[300][301] Kris Kristofferson claims that "she blows me away. It's amazing to me that someone so young is writing such great songs. She's got a great career ahead of her".[302][303] Dolly Parton is "extremely impressed with her, especially with her songwriting .... I'm real impressed with the depth of her sometimes": "She's got the qualities that could last a long time".[304][305] Stevie Nicks believes Swift writes "songs that make the whole world sing, like Neil Diamond or Elton John ... It's women like her who are going to save the music business".[150] Swift has also received songwriting praise from contemporaries including Alicia Keys,[306] Kelly Clarkson[307] and Lady Gaga.[308] Christopher Owens, the songwriter and former frontman of Girls, describes Swift as his "favourite artist out of anybody", and has expressed a desire to work with her.[309][310] The New York Times has noted similarities in the songwriting approach of Owens and Swift.[311] Ryan Adams has said that "every tune of hers is like the one you wait a whole lifetime to write".[312] Lena Dunham, the creator and star of HBO's television series Girls, has described Swift as her "artistic kindred spirit ... the way she uses autobiography in her work and the way she calls out guys who have, you know, fronted on her before. But at the same time there is something sort of affectionate and non-judgmental about her music that I appreciate."[313][314][315]Thematically, The Guardian has noted that Swift was "fantastically good at regarding teenage life with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia" over the course of her first two albums.[316] New York Magazine has remarked that few singer-songwriters have written "great records so explicitly about their teens ... Her nearest antecedent might be sixties-era Brian Wilson, the one true adolescent auteur before she came along".[317] Comparisons have also been drawn with Janis Ian.[294] Fairytale imagery featured on Swift's second album, Fearless. She explored the disconnect "between fairy tales and the reality of love": "We're raised as little girls to think that we're a princess and that Prince Charming is going to sweep us off our feet".[318][319] Her third and fourth albums addressed more adult relationships.[295] In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships ("The Best Day", "Never Grow Up", "Ronan"), friendships ("Fifteen", "Breathe", "22"),[320][321] alienation ("The Outside", "A Place In This World", "Tied Together with a Smile", "Mean") and career ambitions ("Change", "Long Live", "The Lucky One").[322][323] Her defining quality as a songwriter, it has been said, is "a determination to register and hang onto fleeting feelings and impressions, a pre-emptive nostalgia for a present (and sometimes even a future) that she knows will some day be in the past".[324] Swift frequently includes "a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative".[325] The New Yorker has said that her songs, "though they are not subversive, have a certain sophistication ... Sentimental songs are laced with intimations of future disillusionment".[326]Structurally, Slate notes that Swift has "effortless, preternatural mastery of pop conventions: Very few songwriters can build better bridges than she does."[327] Rolling Stone has described her as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture".[328] The Village Voice has noted that Swift uses third-verse POV reversals frequently.[325] She has a tendency to use the same images repeatedly. In the words of The Guardian, "she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot".[316] American Songwriter describes Swift as "a great songwriter, who writes with an unmatched and almost unnatural acuity ... Even her earliest material is characterized by thoughtful  perhaps meticulous  word choice and deliberate melodic construction, with nary a lazy rhyme or aimless tune to be found."[329][330] While reviews of Swift's work are "almost uniformly positive", The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary".[294]Swift uses autobiographical detail in her work.[331] Listening to music as a child, she felt confused "when I knew something was going on in someone's personal life and they didn't address it in their music".[332] The New York Times believes that "righting wrongs is Ms. Swift's raison d'tre".[333] In her songs, Swift often addresses the "anonymous crushes of her high school years" and, more recently, fellow celebrities.[333] Entertainment Weekly remarked that Speak Now was sometimes "an exercise in name-that-celebrity Whac-a-Mole".[334] John Mayer, the presumed subject of "Dear John", has said the song "humiliated" him: "I think it's kind of cheap songwriting. I know she's the biggest thing in the world, and I'm not trying to sink anybody's ship, but I think it's abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go, 'Wait till he gets a load of this!'"[335] The Village Voice has downplayed this aspect of Swift's songwriting: "Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic."[336] New York Magazine believes the media scrutiny over her decision to use autobiographical detail "is sexist, inasmuch as its not asked of her male peers": "Its a relief to see Swift, the ur-nice-girl, refuse to give the mea culpa that many journalists she's talked to have sought ... I would hate for her to get shamed into discretion."[337] The singer herself has said that all her songs are not factual[338] and are often based on observations.[339] Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk specifically about song subjects "because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus."[340]Swift's music contains elements of pop, pop rock, country and country-pop.[341][341][342] She self-identifies as a country artist.[343] Rolling Stone asserts that, "she might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days".[344] Swift's own definition of country music "is really pretty simple. It's when someone sings about their life and what they know, from an authentic place ... One guy will write about how he grew up on a farm and fell in love and raised kids on that same farm. Some people sing about how, when they get sad, they go to the bar and drink whiskey. I write songs about how I can't seem to figure out relationships and how I'm fascinated by love".[343] She has said there will be "a huge temptation" to make an alt-country record as her career progresses.[45] The New York Times notes that, "There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country  a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar  but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville."[345] The New Yorker believes she is "considered part of Nashville's country-pop tradition only because she writes narrative songs with melodic clarity and dramatic shapeNashville's stock-in-trade."[346] The Guardian has said that Swift "cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory".[316] Similarly, Rolling Stone has noted that her melodies call to mind "Swedish pop gods Dr. Luke and Max Martin".[328]Swift's voice has been described as "sweet but soft".[347] In studio recordings, the Los Angeles Times identifies Swift's "defining" vocal gesture as "the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy".[163] Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, remarked: "Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough".[348] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously "bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean".[165] Slate, reviewing Speak Now, described Swift as "a technically poor singer": "Though she does vary her phrasing in ways that attempt to mask her limited voice (the way she sneers, "She looks at me like I'm a trend/And she's so over it," on "Better Than Revenge" is especially effective), Swift is still noticeably off-pitch at least once on every song on the album".[349] In a live setting, Swift, according to The Hollywood Reporter, "does her best, but certainly doesn't have the pipes to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Christina Aguilera or Carrie Underwood".[347] Her live vocals have been described as "flat", "thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt".[350][351] However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.[352][353][354] In an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across".[1][355] Scott Borchetta of Big Machine Records has conceded that Swift is "not the best technical singer" but describes her as the "best communicator that we've got".[356] Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has "put a lot of work" into improving it.[357] It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons.[358][359] She has said that she only feels nervous performing "if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows".[360]Swift has been described as "America's sweetheart" and "a role model".[361][362] She has high Q Score and Davie-Brown Index ratings, reflecting a high level of public awareness (90 percent) and popularity (80 percent) in the United States.[363] The singer considers it her "responsibility" to be conscious of her influence on young fans.[364] A Rolling Stone journalist who profiled Swift in 2009 remarked upon her polite manners: "If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops".[49][365] In 2012, Rolling Stone remarked upon Swift's "ease with glad-handing ... it's not hard to imagine her running for office someday"[366] while The Hollywood Reporter referred to her as "the Best People Person Since Bill Clinton".[367] It has been said that she is "the kind of driven, intensely ambitious person whod thrive regardless of her profession".[368] A 2012 Vogue cover story described Swift as "clever and funny and occasionally downright bawdy" in person.[369] Grantland describes Swift as "dorky" and "openly neurotic in a way you'd never see from a blonde country princess like Faith Hill or Carrie Underwood. She is more like Diane Keaton in Annie Hall: overly gracious and eager to please but full of a nonstop, nervous, fluttering energy".[370]In the early years of her career, Swift's signature look consisted of sundresses and cowboy boots.[371][372] This fashion style is still copied by many of the young fans who attend her concerts.[371][373] At formal events, Swift became known for "sparkly, beaded dresses".[371] Her naturally curly hairstyle is replicated by fans, and Swift has remarked: "I remember straightening my hair because I wanted to be like everybody else, and now the fact that anybody would emulate what I do? It's just funny."[373] She was asked by Vogue to cut bangs for a cover shoot in late 2011, and now straightens her hair.[374] Swift favors retro style and it has been said that she has the look of "a nineteen-thirties movie siren ... red lipstick, thick mascara."[375][376] She was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011.[377] She has named Franoise Hardy, Jane Birkin, Brigitte Bardot, and Audrey Hepburn as her own style inspirations.[378]There has been much media commentary about Swift's reactions when she is recognized at award ceremonies.[379][380] In 2011, The Hollywood Reporter remarked that Swift "seems to be consistently shocked and wonderstruck by each awards win, despite racking up an ever-growing collection of Grammys, CMAs, MTV Moonmen and AMAs".[379] Kristen Wiig parodied Swift's surprised facial expressions during a Saturday Night Live sketch in February 2012.[381] Swift later said she had seen the sketch: "I was laughing the entire time and then I realized that, as I was watching it, I was making the face she was making".[382] At the Academy of Country Music Awards in April 2012, the ceremony's host Blake Shelton joked in his opening monologue that Swift should release a perfume called "I can't believe I smell this good". When Swift later presented Shelton with the Academy's Best Male Vocalist award, "the two faced off, showing each other their ultra-surprised looks".[383][384]The merits of Swift as a feminist have been widely discussed.[385] She has been described by Jezebel as "a feminist's nightmare": "Her image of being good and pure plays right into how much the patriarchy fetishizes virginity, loves purity, and celebrates women who know their place as delicate flowers".[386] A Village Voice music critic, using supporting evidence from Swift's body of work, dismissed such criticisms as "shallow and gross, in that special way that things get gross when you cram shaded and living work through an ideological sieve like you're mechanically separating chicken".[387] It has been said that anti-Swift feminists "criticize Taylor for being repressive and perpetuating a patriarchal virgin/whore dichotomy by being repressive and perpetuating a virgin/whore dichotomy ... When people dismiss the stories that Taylor Swift writes as unrealistic, unfeminist pap or dismiss Taylor Swift herself as a sexist figure  even if we take them at face value, even if we pretend that Taylor Swift is indeed a virgin who thinks having sex is a bad thing and falling in love and having babies is the best experience a girl can have, they're still wrong. They're still wrong to dismiss her. Because by dismissing her, they're saying that those experiences and those beliefs are invalid and girls shouldn't have them  and that if girls do have them, then they're inferior in some way (unfeminist, unintelligent, uncool, whatever) ... It's the opposite of slut-shaming. It's prude-shaming, and it's no better or more enlightened or more feminist than slut-shaming, because it's still shaming."[388]The song "Fifteen" has been the subject of particular scrutiny. It has been said that the song contains a "feminist message" in the lyrics "Back then I swore I was gonna marry him some day, but I realized some bigger dreams of mine" and "In your life, you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team".[389] Feminist critics claim the use of the word "everything" in the lyric "Abigail gave everything she had to a boy, who changed his mind, and we both cried" is a reference to virginity: "Songs like 'Fifteen' dig up the ancient Puritan ideal that girls can only access power by confidently and heterosexually denying access to their pants."[390] However, others interpret "everything" as trust: "Abigail trusted and opened up to a boy for the first time, only to be let down. Maybe that includes sex, maybe it doesn't."[389]When asked by The New York Times in 2010 whether she considered herself a feminist, Swift replied, "I have never really thought about that".[391] In 2012, when again asked her position, she said that she was "raised by parents who brought me up to think if you work as hard as guys, you can go far in life." She added that she hoped her music was empowering to women: "Theres strength when youre baring your emotions."[392] Later that year, Swift told Elle Canada that feminism was something "I have a lot to learn about ... I want to end up really educated about all these really big topics."[393]Swift made her acting debut in a 2009 episode of CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, playing a rebellious teenager.[394] The New York Times noted that the character allowed Swift to be "a little bit naughty, and credibly so".[395] Rolling Stone felt she "held her own" and "does a good job with the script"[396] while the Chicago Tribune said she "acquits herself well".[397] Later that year, Swift both hosted and performed as the musical guest for an episode of Saturday Night Live.[398] Entertainment Weekly described her as "this season's best Saturday Night Live host so far", noting that she "was always up for the challenge, seemed to be having fun, and helped the rest of the cast nail the punchlines". Proving "admirably resilient in a wide variety of sketch roles", "Swift inspired more of a female, girly-in-the-best-sense sensibility in SNL than it's shown since the Tina Fey-Amy Poehler days".[399]Swift made her feature film acting debut in the 2010 ensemble comedy Valentine's Day, playing the ditzy Valley girlfriend of a high school jock.[400] The Los Angeles Times felt the performance suggested "serious comedic potential"[401] while the San Francisco Chronicle found her "very funny".[402] Time remarked that Swift portrayed her character "rather charmingly";[403] The Boston Globe described her as "adorably dorky".[404] Salon asserted that she was "one of the few actors not wasted in "Valentine's Day". Her overgrown-pixie look and odd, widely set eyes lend her a little bit of Marilyn and a little bit of Lucille Ball: She's Taylor-made for comic greatness."[405] However, Variety found her "entirely undirected ... she needs to find a skilled director to tamp her down and channel her obviously abundant energy".[406] The Daily News described her performance as "painfully clunky" while Slant Magazine found her "unwatchable".[407][408] In 2012, Swift voiced the character of Audrey, a tree lover, in the animated film The Lorax.[409]Swift's philanthropic efforts have been recognised by the Do Something Awards,[410] The Giving Back Fund[411] and the Tennessee Disaster Services.[412] In 2012, Michelle Obama presented Swift with The Big Help Award for her "dedication to helping others" and "inspiring others through action".[413] In December 2012, Ethel Kennedy will present Swift with the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights's Ripple of Hope Award because of her "dedication to advocacy at such a young age".[414]Swift is a supporter of arts education. In 2010, she donated $75,000 to Nashville's Hendersonville High School to help refurbish the school auditorium's sound and lighting systems.[415] In 2012, she pledged $4 million to fund the building of a new education center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville.[416] The 7,500-square-foot building is scheduled to open in 2014 and will facilitate new programs and workshops for teenagers and senior citizens.[417][418] The space will include three classrooms and an exhibit space, and will house interactive activities such as a musical petting zoo and a "wet" classroom space to make concert posters and other art projects.[419] Museum officials have decided to name it The Taylor Swift Education Center and the singer will be involved in an advisory capacity.[420] Also in 2012, Swift partnered with textbook rental company Chegg to donate $60,000 to the music departments of six US colleges.[421][422]Swift promotes children's literacy. In 2009, she donated $250,000 to various schools around the country that she had either attended or had other associations with. The money was used to buy books, fund educational programs and help pay teachers' salaries.[423] In 2010, she took part in a live webcast, Read Now! with Taylor Swift, broadcast exclusively in US schools to celebrate Scholastic's Read Every Day campaign.[424][425] In 2011, Swift donated 6,000 Scholastic books to Reading Public Library, Pennsylvania[426] and, in 2012, she donated 14,000 books to Nashville Public Library, Tennessee.[427] Most of the books were placed in circulation; the rest were gifted to children from low-income families, preschools and daycare centers.[427] In 2012, she co-chaired the National Education Association's Read Across America campaign and recorded a PSA encouraging children to read.[428][429] Also in 2012, Swift promoted the "power of reading" in a second live Scholastic webcast, broadcast directly to US classrooms.[430]Throughout her career, Swift has donated money to help victims of natural disasters. In 2008, she donated the proceeds from her merchandise sales at the Country Music Festival to the Red Cross's disaster relief fund.[431] Later that year, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the Iowa flood of 2008.[432] In 2009, Swift supported the Victorian Bushfire Appeal by joining the lineup at Sydney's Sound Relief concert,[433] reportedly making the biggest contribution of any artist to the Australian Red Cross.[434] In 2010, she took part in the Hope for Haiti telethon; she performed and answered phone calls from viewers wishing to donate money.[435] She also recorded a song for the Hope for Haiti Now album.[436] In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, Swift donated $500,000 during a telethon hosted by WSMV.[437] Later that year, she donated $100,000 to help rebuild a playground in Hendersonville, Tennessee which was damaged by floodwater.[438] In 2011, Swift used the final dress rehearsal for the North American leg of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the United States, raising more than $750,000.[439] She also donated $250,000 to Alabama football coach Nick Saban's charity, Nick's Kids, to aid in the tornado relief efforts of West Alabama.[440] In 2012, Swift supported Architecture for Humanity's Restore the Shore MTV telethon in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.[441]Swift opposes LGBT discrimination. Following the 2008 murder of Larry King, she recorded a Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network PSA to combat hate crimes.[442] On the first anniversary of King's death, Swift told Seventeen that her parents taught her "never to judge others based on whom they love, what color their skin is, or their religion".[443] In 2011, the music video for Swift's anti-bullying song "Mean" dealt in part with homophobia in high schools; the video was later nominated for an MTV VMA social activism award.[444][445][446] The New York Times believes she is part of "a new wave of young (and mostly straight) women who are providing the soundtrack for a generation of gay fans coming to terms with their identity in a time of turbulent and confusing cultural messages".[444]The singer is involved with a number of charities which provide services to sick children. In 2008, she donated a pink Chevy pick-up truck to the Victory Junction Gang Camp; the truck is used to transport sick children from the airport to the camp.[447] In 2009, after performing at the BBC Children in Need annual telethon, she donated $20,000 to the cause.[448] In 2011, as the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year, Swift donated $25,000 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Tennessee. This figure was matched by the Academy.[449] In 2012, Swift participated in the Stand Up to Cancer telethon, performing "Ronan", a song she wrote in memory of a four-year-old boy who died of neuroblastoma. The song was made available for digital download, with all proceeds donated to cancer-related charities.[450] Swift has met with many sick fans through the Make-A-Wish Foundation.[451][452][453][454] She has also made private visits to hospitals such as St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Ronald McDonald House.[455][456][457]Swift has encouraged young people to volunteer in their local community as part of Global Youth Service Day[18] and has promoted The @15 Fund, a social change platform underwritten by Best Buy, which gives teenagers the opportunity to direct the company's philanthropy.[458] In 2007, she launched a campaign to protect children from online predators, in partnership with the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police.[459] Also in 2007, she supported an Allstate campaign which promotes safe teenage driving.[460] In 2009, Swift recorded a Sound Matters PSA to make listeners aware of the importance of listening "responsibly".[461] She appeared in a Got Milk? campaign in 2010.[462] Swift has donated auctionable items to a large number of charities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation,[463] the UNICEF Tap Project,[464] Oxfam International,[465] Habitat For Humanity,[466] MusiCares[467] and Feeding America.[468] She has also performed at a number of benefit concerts, including for the Food Bank For New York City,[469] the Reading, Writing & Rhythm Foundation,[470] Christmas for Kids[471] and Shriners Hospitals for Children.[472]Swift's main residence is a duplex penthouse in Midtown Nashville, Tennessee.[1][473] She also maintains a residence in Beverly Hills, California.[474][475] In addition, she owns a house, purchased for her parents' use, in Brentwood, Tennessee.[476][477] According to Forbes's Celebrity 100 list, released annually in the month of May, Swift earned $18million in 2009,[478] $45million in 2010,[479] $45 million in 2011[480] and $57 million in 2012.[481]Swift dated singer Joe Jonas from July to October 2008,[482][483] and actor Taylor Lautner from October to December 2009.[484][485] She was romantically linked to musician John Mayer from late 2009 until early 2010.[486][487][488][489] Swift dated actor Jake Gyllenhaal from October to December 2010.[490][491][492][493][494] On December 9, 2010, Gyllenhaal called the LAPD for assistance, after a large number of photographers followed the couple's car in Los Angeles.[495] Following their break-up, they were seen together in January and February 2011.[496][497] Swift dated Conor Kennedy, the son of Robert F.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the seventh and final of the Harry Potter novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The book was released on 21July2007 by Bloomsbury Publishing in the United Kingdom, in the United States by Scholastic, and in Canada by Raincoast Books, ending the series that began in 1997 with the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The novel chronicles the events directly following Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005), and the final confrontation between the wizards Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in January 2007. Before its release, Bloomsbury reportedly spent GB10million to keep the book's contents safe before its release date. American publisher Arthur Levine refused any copies of the novel to be released in advance for press review, although two reviews were submitted early. Shortly before release, photos of all 759 pages of the U.S. edition were leaked and transcribed, leading Scholastic to look for the source that had leaked it.Released globally in 93 countries, Deathly Hallows broke sales records as the fastest-selling book ever, a record it still holds today.[2] It sold 15million copies in the first 24 hours following its release, including more than 11million in the U.S. and UK alone. The previous record, 9million in its first day, had been held by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The novel has also been translated into over 120languages, including Ukrainian, Swedish, and Hindi.Major themes in the novel are death and living in a corrupted society, and critics have compared them to Christian allegories. Generally well-received, the book won the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award, and the American Library Association named it a "Best Book for Young Adults". A two-part film adaptation began showing in November 2010 when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  Part 1 was released; Part 2 was released on 15 July 2011.Throughout the six previous novels in the series, the titular character Harry Potter has struggled with the difficulties of adolescence along with being a famous wizard. When Harry was a baby, Lord Voldemort, a powerful evil wizard, murdered Harry's parents but vanished after attempting to kill Harry. Harry immediately became famous, and was placed in the care of his Muggle (non-magical) relatives Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon.In Philosopher's Stone, Harry re-enters the wizarding world at age 11 and enrolls in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He makes friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also meets the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, and Professor Severus Snape, who dislikes him. Harry fights Voldemort several times while at school, as the wizard tries to regain a physical form. In Goblet of Fire, Harry is entered in a dangerous magical competition called the Triwizard Tournament. At the conclusion of the Tournament, Harry witnesses the return of Lord Voldemort to full strength. During Order of the Phoenix, Harry and several of his friends face off against Voldemort's Death Eaters, a group of Dark witches and wizards, and narrowly defeat them. In Half-Blood Prince, Harry learns that Voldemort has created six "horcruxes" to become immortal. A Horcrux is a fragment of a person's soul placed within an object so that when the body dies, a part of the soul remains and the person can be regenerated or resurrected.[3] However, the destruction of the creator's body leaves the wizard or witch in a state of half-life, without corporeal form.[4] Two horcruxes have already been destroyed, one by Harry in the events of Chamber of Secrets and one by Dumbledore shortly before the events of Half-Blood Prince. When returning from a mission to discover a horcrux, Dumbledore is murdered by Snape, a former Death Eater whom Harry suspected of secretly remaining loyal to Voldemort. At the conclusion of the book, Harry decides to leave school, find and destroy the remaining four Horcruxes, and defeat the evil wizard Voldemort, once and for all.Following Dumbledore's death, Voldemort continues to gain support and increase his power. When Harry turns seventeen, the protection he has at his aunt and uncle's house will be broken. Before that can happen, at Mad Eye Moody's suggestion, Harry flees to the Burrow with his friends, many of whom use Polyjuice Potion to impersonate him so as to confuse any Death Eaters that may attack. They are indeed attacked shortly after leaving Privet Drive; Mad Eye is killed, and George Weasley wounded, but the rest arrive safely at the Burrow. Ron and Hermione decide to accompany Harry, instead of returning to Hogwarts School for their seventh year, to finish the quest Dumbledore started: to hunt and destroy Voldemort's four remaining Horcruxes. They have little knowledge about the remaining Horcruxes except that one is a locket once owned by Hogwarts' co-founder Salazar Slytherin, one is possibly a cup once owned by co-founder Helga Hufflepuff, a third may be connected with co-founder Rowena Ravenclaw, and the fourth may be Nagini, Voldemort's snake familiar. The whereabouts of the founders' objects is unknown, and Nagini is presumed to be with Voldemort. Before leaving, they attend Ron's brother's Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour, with Harry disguised by Polyjuice Potion, but the Ministry of Magic is taken over by Death Eaters during the wedding and they barely escape with their lives.Harry, Ron, and Hermione flee to 12 Grimmauld Place in London, which is Sirius Black's family's house, where they learn from the house-elf Kreacher the whereabouts of Salazar Slytherin's locket, which Sirius' brother Regulus stole from Voldemort at the cost of his own life. They successfully recover this Horcrux by infiltrating the Ministry of Magic and stealing it from Dolores Umbridge. Under the object's evil influence and the stress of being on the run, Ron leaves the others. As Harry and Hermione search for the Horcruxes, they learn more about Dumbledore's past, including the insanity and death of Dumbledore's younger sister and his connection to the evil wizard Grindewald. Harry and Hermione ultimately travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and the place where his parents died. They meet the eldery magical historian Bathilda Bagshot, who turns out to be Nagini in disguise and attacks them. They escape into the Forest of Dean, where a mysterious silver doe that appears to be a Patronus leads Harry to the Sword of Hogwarts co-founder Godric Gryffindor, one of the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes, lying at the bottom of an icy lake. When Harry attempts to recover the sword from the pool, the Horcrux attempts to kill him. Ron reappears, saving Harry and then using the sword to destroy the locket. Resuming their search, the trio repeatedly encounter a strange symbol that an eccentric wizard named Xenophilius Lovegood tells them represents the mythical Deathly Hallows. The Hallows are three sacred objects: the Elder Wand, an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, with the power to summon the dead to the living world; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. Harry learns that Voldemort is seeking the Elder Wand, recognizes the Resurrection Stone from the second Horcrux, which Dumbledore had destroyed, and realizes that his own Invisibility Cloak is the one mentioned in the story, but he is unaware of the Hallows' significance.The trio are captured and taken to Malfoy Manor, where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione. Harry and Ron are thrown in the cellar, where they find Luna Lovegood, Ollivander, Dean Thomas, and Griphook. They escape to Shell Cottage (Bill and Fleur's house) with Dobby's help, but at the cost of the house-elf's life. Harry now realizes that the Hallows may have the power to defeat Death and knows that Voldemort robbed Dumbledore's tomb to procure the Elder Wand, but he decides to focus on finding the Horcruxes instead of the Hallows. With Griphook's help, they learn that Helga Hufflepuff's cup - a Horcrux - is hidden in Bellatrix's vault at Gringotts, break into her vault, retrieve the cup, and escape on a dragon, with Griphook swiping the sword and escaping on his own. From his connection to Voldemort's thoughts, Harry learns that another Horcrux is hidden in Hogwarts, which is under the control of Severus Snape. Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter the school through Hogsmeade (being saved by Aberforth Dumbledore, who explains more about Albus's backstory) and - with the help of the teachers - Snape is ousted from the school. Ron and Hermione go to the Chamber of Secrets and destroy the cup using a basilisk fang. The trio then finds Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem (another Horcrux) in the Room of Requirement. Vincent Crabbe casts a Fiendfyre curse in an attempt to kill Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but he instead destroys the diadem, the Room of Requirement, and himself. At this point, a total of five Horcruxes have been destroyed.The Death Eaters and Voldemort besiege Hogwarts, while Harry, Ron, Hermione, their allies, and various magical creatures defend the school. Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle, including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and Fred Weasley. Voldemort kills Severus Snape because he believes doing so will make him the Elder Wand's true master, since Snape killed Dumbledore. Harry discovers while viewing Snape's memories that Voldemort inadvertently made Harry into a seventh Horcrux when he attacked him as a baby, which is the true significance of Harry's scar, and that Harry must die in order to destroy Voldemort. These memories also confirm Snape's unwavering loyalty to Dumbledore and that his role as a double-agent against Voldemort never wavered after Voldemort killed Lily Evans, Harry's mother and Snape's one true love. Harry also learns that Dumbledore had less than a year to live when he died, that his death by Snape's hand had been per Dumbledore's request, and that Dumbledore had known that Harry must die. After using the Resurrection Stone to bring back his deceased loved ones for a short while, Harry surrenders himself to death at Voldemort's hand. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse at him, but it only sends Harry into a limbo-like state between life and death.While in this state, Dumbledore's spirit explains to Harry that when Voldemort used Harry's blood to regain his full strength, it protected Harry from Voldemort killing him; however, the Horcrux inside Harry has been destroyed, and Harry can return to his body despite being hit by the Killing Curse. Dumbledore also explains that Harry became the true master of the Deathly Hallows by facing Death, not by seeking to avoid it or conquer it. Harry returns to his body, feigning death, and Voldemort marches victoriously into the castle with his body. However, per Harry's prior instructions, Neville Longbottom kills Nagini, the last Horcrux, with the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry then reveals that he is still alive, and the battle resumes, with Bellatrix Lestrange being killed by Molly Weasley.Harry and Voldemort engage in a final climactic duel. Harry reveals that because he willingly sacrificed himself to death by Voldemort's hand, his act of love would protect the Wizarding community from Voldemort in the same way the sacrifice Harry's mother made protected Harry. Harry also reveals that Snape was not loyal to Voldemort, did not murder Dumbledore, and was never the master of the Elder Wand. Instead, Draco was the master of the Elder Wand after disarming Dumbledore, but, because Harry had disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor, Harry is the true master of the Elder Wand. Harry claims that the wand will refuse to kill the one to whom it owes allegiance, further protecting Harry. During the duel, Harry refuses to use the killing curse and even encourages Voldemort to feel remorse, one known way to restore Voldemort's shattered soul. Voldemort dies when his own killing curse backfires against Harry's disarming curse, killing himself; the Death Eaters are finally defeated. The wizarding world is able to live in peace once more.The novel, the last in the series, closes with a brief epilogue set 19 years later, in which Harry and Ginny Weasley are a married couple with three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. Ron and Hermione Weasley are also married and have two children, Rose and Hugo. The families meet at King's Cross station, where a nervous Albus is departing for his first year at Hogwarts. Harry's godson, Teddy Lupin, is found kissing Bill and Fleur Weasley's daughter Victoire in a train carriage. Harry sees Draco Malfoy and his wife with their son, Scorpius. Neville Longbottom is now the Hogwarts Herbology professor and remains friends with the two families. Harry comforts Albus, who is worried he will be sorted into Slytherin, and tells his son that one of his two namesakes, Severus Snape, was a Slytherin and the bravest man he had ever met. He adds that the Sorting Hat takes one's choice into account, like it did for Harry. The book ends with these final words: "The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well."Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published by Bloomsbury, the publisher of all Harry Potter books in the United Kingdom, on 30 June 1997.[5] It was released in the United States on 1 September 1998 by Scholasticthe American publisher of the booksas Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,[6] after Rowling had received US$105,000 for the American rightsan unprecedented amount for a children's book by a then-unknown author.[7]The second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998, and in the US on 2 June 1999. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999, and in the US on 8 September 1999.[8] Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[9] Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the series at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version.[10] It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003.[11] Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was published on 16 July 2005, and it sold 9million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[12][13]Shortly before releasing the title, J. K. Rowling announced that she had considered three titles for the book.[14][15] The final title, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, named after the mythical Deathly Hallows in the novel, was released to the public on 21December2006, via a special Christmas-themed hangman puzzle on Rowling's website, confirmed shortly afterwards by the book's publishers.[16] When asked during a live chat about the other titles she had been considering, Rowling mentioned Harry Potter and the Elder Wand and Harry Potter and the Peverell Quest.[14]Rowling completed the book while staying at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh in January2007, and left a signed statement on a marble bust of Hermes in her room which read: "J. K. Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in this room (652) on 11January2007".[17] In a statement on her website, she said, "I've never felt such a mixture of extreme emotions in my life, never dreamed I could feel simultaneously heartbroken and euphoric." She compared her mixed feelings to those expressed by Charles Dickens in the preface of the 1850 edition of David Copperfield, "a two-years' imaginative task". "To which," she added, "I can only sigh, try seventeen years, Charles". She ended her message by saying "Deathly Hallows is my favourite, and that is the most wonderful way to finish the series".[18]When asked before publication about the forthcoming book, Rowling stated that she could not change the ending even if she wanted. "These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they're all leading a certain direction. So, I really can't".[19] She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, "almost as though they are two halves of the same novel".[20] She has said that the last chapter of the book was written "in something like 1990", as part of her earliest work on the series.[21] Rowling also revealed she originally wrote the last words to be "something like: 'Only those who he loved could see his lightning scar'". Rowling changed this because she did not want people to think Voldemort would rise again and to say that Harry's mission was over.[22]In a 2006 interview, J. K. Rowling said that the main theme of the series is Harry dealing with death,[23] which was influenced by her mother's death in 1990, from multiple sclerosis.[22][23][24][25] Lev Grossman of Time stated that the main theme of the series was the overwhelming importance of continuing to love in the face of death.[26]Academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including political subtexts. Themes such as normality, oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series.[27] Similarly, the theme of making one's way through adolescence and "going over one's most harrowing ordealsand thus coming to terms with them" has also been considered.[28] Rowling has stated that the books comprise "a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry" and that also pass on a message to "question authority and... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth".[29]Some political commentators have seen J. K. Rowling's portrayal of the bureaucratised Ministry of Magic and the oppressive measures taken by the Ministry in the later books (like making attendance at Hogwarts School compulsory and the "registration of Mudbloods" with the Ministry) as an allegory of criticising the state.[30]The Harry Potter series has been under criticism for supposedly supporting witchcraft and occult. Before publication of Deathly Hallows, Rowling refused to speak out about her religion, stating, "If I talk too freely, every reader, whether 10 or 60, will be able to guess what's coming in the books".[31] However, many have noted Christian allegories apparent in Deathly Hallows.[31] For example, Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. The location where this occurs is King's Cross.[32] Harry also urges Voldemort to show remorse, to restore his shattered soul. Rowling also stated that "my belief and my struggling with religious belief ... I think is quite apparent in this book", which is shown as Harry struggles with his faith in Dumbledore.[33]Deathly Hallows begins with a pair of epigraphs, one by Quaker leader William Penn and one from Aeschylus' The Libation Bearers. Of this, Rowling said "I really enjoyed choosing those two quotations because one is pagan, of course, and one is from a Christian tradition. I'd known it was going to be those two passages since Chamber was published. I always knew [that] if I could use them at the beginning of book seven then I'd cued up the ending perfectly. If they were relevant, then I went where I needed to go. They just say it all to me, they really do".[34]When Harry visits his parents' grave, the biblical reference "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death" (1 Corinthians 15:26) is inscribed on the grave.[35] The Dumbledores' family tomb also holds a biblical quote: "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also", which is from Matthew 6:21.[35] Rowling states, "They're very British books, so on a very practical note Harry was going to find biblical quotations on tombstones...[but] I think those two particular quotations he finds on the tombstones at Godric's Hollow, they sum up they almost epitomise the whole series".[35]Harry Potter pundit John Granger additionally noted that one of the reasons the Harry Potter books were so popular is their use of literary alchemy (similar to Romeo and Juliet, C. S. Lewis's Perelandra and Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities) and vision symbolism.[36] In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, death and resurrection of Christ.[37] While the entire series utilizes symbols common in alchemy, the Deathly Hallows completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.Christian author Nancy Carpentier Brown also noted many Christian themes, such as Harry marking Mad-Eye Moody's grave with a cross, showing remorse and giving Voldemort a chance to redeem himself, and the Resurrection Stone.[38] She also pointed out that Harry becomes a godfather to Tonks and Lupin's son, Teddy Lupin.[38]The launch was celebrated by an all-night book signing and reading at the Natural History Museum in London, which Rowling attended along with 1,700 guests chosen by ballot.[39] Rowling toured the US in October 2007, where another event was held at Carnegie Hall in New York City with tickets allocated by sweepstake.[40]Scholastic, the American publisher of the Harry Potter series, launched a multi-million dollar "There will soon be 7" marketing campaign with a "Knight Bus" travelling to 40 libraries across the United States, online fan discussions and competitions, collectible bookmarks, tattoos, and the staged release of seven Deathly Hallows questions most debated by fans.[41] In the build-up to the book's release, Scholastic released seven questions that fans would find answered in the final book:[42]J. K. Rowling arranged with her publishers for a poster bearing the face of the missing British child Madeleine McCann to be made available to book sellers when Deathly Hallows was launched on 21July2007, and said that she hoped that the posters would be displayed prominently in shops all over the world.[43]After it was told that the novel would be released on 21July2007, Warner Bros. shortly thereafter said that the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix would be released shortly before the novel would be released, on 13July2007,[44] making many people proclaim that July2007, was the month of Harry Potter.[45]Bloomsbury invested GB10million in an attempt to keep the book's contents secure until the 21July release date.[46] Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway.[47] There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalmentsthat the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the serieswould no longer be a deterrent.[48]In the week before its release, a number of texts purporting to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the U.S. edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date.[49][50][51][52] The photographs later appeared on websites and peer-to-peer networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena in order to identify one source.[53] This represented the most serious security breach in the Harry Potter series' history.[54] Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks.[55] Reviews published in both The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times on 18July2007, corroborated many of the plot elements from this leak, and about one day prior to release, The New York Times confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.[54]Scholastic announced that approximately one-ten-thousandth (0.0001) of the U.S. supply had been shipped early interpreted to mean about 1,200 copies. One reader in Maryland received a copy of the book in the mail from DeepDiscount.com four days before it was launched, which evoked incredulous responses from both Scholastic and DeepDiscount. Scholastic initially reported that they were satisfied it had been a "human error" and would not discuss possible penalties;[56] however, the following day Scholastic announced that it would be launching legal action against DeepDiscount.com and its distributor, Levy Home Entertainment.[57] Scholastic filed for damages in Chicago's Circuit Court of Cook County, claiming that DeepDiscount engaged in a "complete and flagrant violation of the agreements that they knew were part of the carefully constructed release of this eagerly awaited book."[58] Some of the early release books soon appeared on eBay, in one case being sold to Publishers Weekly for US$250from an initial price of US$18.[59]Asda,[60][61] along with several other UK supermarkets, having already taken pre-orders for the book at a heavily discounted price, sparked a price war two days before the book's launch by announcing they would sell it for just GB5 a copy (about US$8). Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a loss leader. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even Waterstone's, the UK's largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the UK Booksellers Association, said, "It is a war we can't even participate in. We think it's a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans." Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: "You are not only lowering the price of the book. At this point, you are lowering the value of reading."[62]In Malaysia, a similar price war caused controversy regarding sales of the book.[63] Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia is MYR 109.90 (about GB16), while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90 (about GB10). The move by the bookstores was seen as an attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24July2007, the price war has ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour are selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good business sense and fair trade.[64]The book's early Saturday morning release in Israel was criticised for violating Shabbat. Trade and Industry Minister Eli Yishai commented "It is forbidden, according to Jewish values and Jewish culture, that a thing like this should take place at 2a.m. on Saturday. Let them do it on another day."[65] Yishai indicated that he would issue indictments and fines based on the Hours of Work and Rest Law.[66]The Baltimore Sun's critic, Mary Carole McCauley, noted that the book was more serious than the previous novels in the series and had more straightforward prose.[67] Furthermore, reviewer Alice Fordham from The Times wrote that "Rowling's genius is not just her total realisation of a fantasy world, but the quieter skill of creating characters that bounce off the page, real and flawed and brave and lovable". Fordham concluded, "We have been a long way together, and neither Rowling nor Harry let us down in the end".[68] The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani agreed, praising Rowling's ability to make Harry both a hero and a character that can be related to.[69]Time magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, ranking it at #8, and praised Rowling for proving that books can still be a global mass medium.[26] Novelist Elizabeth Hand criticised that "...the spectacularly complex interplay of narrative and character often reads as though an entire trilogy's worth of summing-up has been crammed into one volume."[70] In a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, the reviewer said, "Rowling has shown uncommon skill in playing them with and against each other, and also woven them into a darn good bildungsroman, populated by memorable characters and infused with a saving, irrepressible sense of fun". They also praised the second half of the novel, but criticised the epilogue, calling it "provacatively sketchy".[71] In another review from The Times, reviewer Amanda Craig said that while Rowling was "not an original, high-concept author", she was "right up there with other greats of children's fiction". Craig went on to say that the novel was "beautifully judged, and a triumphant return to form", and that Rowling's imagination changed the perception of an entire generation, which "is more than all but a handful of living authors, in any genre, have achieved in the past half-century".[72]In contrast, Jenny Sawyer of The Christian Science Monitor said that, "There is much to love about the Harry Potter series, from its brilliantly realised magical world to its multilayered narrative", however, "A story is about someone who changes. And, puberty aside, Harry doesn't change much. As envisioned by Rowling, he walks the path of good so unwaveringly that his final victory over Voldemort feels, not just inevitable, but hollow".[73] In The New York Times, Christopher Hitchens compared the series to World War Two-era English boarding school stories, and while he wrote that "Rowling has won imperishable renown" for the series as a whole, he also stated that he disliked Rowling's use of deus ex machina, that the mid-book camping chapters are "abysmally long", and Voldemort "becomes more tiresome than an Ian Fleming villain".[74] Catherine Bennett of The Guardian praised Rowling for putting small details from the previous books and making them large in Deathly Hallows, such as Grindelwald being mentioned on a Chocolate Frog Card in the first book. While she points out "as her critics say, Rowling is no Dickens", she says that Rowling "has willed into a fictional being, in every book, legions of new characters, places, spells, rules and scores of unimagined twists and subplots".[75]Stephen King criticised the reactions of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work.[76] He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that the subject matter of the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.[76]Sales for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows were record setting. The initial U.S. print run for Deathly Hallows was 12million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble,[77] 500percent higher than pre-sales had been for Half-Blood Prince.[78] On 12April2007, Barnes & Noble declared that Deathly Hallows had broken its pre-order record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site.[79] On opening day, a record 8.3million copies were sold in the United States (over 96 per second),[80][81] and 2.65million copies in the United Kingdom.[82] It holds the Guinness World record for fastest selling book of fiction in 24 hours for U.S. sales.[83] At WH Smith, sales reportedly reached a rate of 15 books sold per second.[84] By June2008, nearly a year after it was published, worldwide sales were reportedly around 44million.[1]Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows has won several awards.[85] In 2007, the book was named one of The New York Times 100 Notable Books,[86] and one of its Notable Children's Books.[87] The novel was named the best book of 2007, by Newsweek's critic Malcolm Jones.[88] Publishers Weekly also listed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows among their Best Books of 2007.[89] In 2008, the American Library Association named the novel one of its Best Books for Young Adults,[90] and also listed it as a Notable Children's Book.[91] Furthermore, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows received the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award.[85]Due to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' worldwide fame, it has been translated into many languages. The first translation to be released was the Ukrainian translation, on 25September2007 (as     ).[92] The Swedish title of the book was revealed by Rowling as Harry Potter and the Relics of Death (Harry Potter och Ddsrelikerna), following a pre-release question from the Swedish publisher about the difficulty of translating the two words "Deathly Hallows" without having read the book.[93] This is also the title used for the French translation (Harry Potter et les reliques de la mort), the Spanish translation (Harry Potter y las Reliquias de la Muerte), the Dutch translation (Harry Potter en de Relieken van de Dood) and the Brazilian Portuguese translation (Harry Potter e as Relquias da Morte).[94] The first Polish translation was released with a new title: Harry Potter i Insygnia mierci Harry Potter and the Insignia of Death.[95] The Hindi translation Harry Potter aur Maut ke Tohfe (     ), which means "Harry Potter and the Gifts of Death", was released by Manjul Publication in India on 27June2008.[96]Deathly Hallows was released in hardcover on 21July2007,[97] and in paperback in the United Kingdom on 10July2008,[98] and in the United States on 7July2009.[99] In SoHo, New York, there was a release party for the American paperback edition, with many games and activities.[100] An "Adult Edition" with a different cover illustration was released by Bloomsbury on 21July2007.[101] To be released simultaneously with the original U.S. hardcover on 21July with only 100,000 copies was a Scholastic deluxe edition, highlighting a new cover illustration by Mary GrandPr.[102] In October2010, Bloomsbury released a "Celebratory" paperback edition, which featured a foiled and starred cover.[103] Lastly, on 1November2010, a "Signature" edition of the novel was released in paperback by Bloomsbury.[104]A two-part film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is directed by David Yates, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman, David Barron and J. K. Rowling. Part 1 was released on 19November2010, and Part 2 on 15July2011.[105][106] Filming began in February2009, and ended on 12June2010.[107] However, the cast confirmed they would reshoot the epilogue scene as they only had two days to shoot the original.[108] Reshoots officially ended around December 2010.[note 1][109] Part 1 ended at Chapter 24 of the book, when Voldemort regained the Elder Wand.[110] However, there were a few omissions, such as the appearances of Dean Thomas and Viktor Krum, and Peter Pettigrew's death.[111] James Bernadelli of Reelviews said that the script stuck closest to the text since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,[112] yet this was met with negativity from some audiences as the film inherited "the book's own problems".[113]Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released simultaneously on 21 July 2007, in both the UK and the United States.[114][115] The UK edition features the voice of Stephen Fry and runs about 24 hours[116] while the U.S. edition features the voice of Jim Dale and runs about 21 hours.[117] Both Fry and Dale recorded 146 different and distinguishable character voices, and was the most recorded by an individual on an audiobook at the time.[118]For his work on Deathly Hallows, Dale won the 2008 Grammy Award for the Best Spoken Word Album for Children.[119] He also was awarded an Earphone Award by AudioFile, who claimed, "Dale has raised the bar on audiobook interpretation so high it's hard to imagine any narrator vaulting over it."[120]On 4 December 2008, Rowling released The Tales of Beedle the Bard both in the UK and US.[121] The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a spin-off of Deathly Hallows and contains fairy tales that are told to children in the "Wizarding World". The book includes five short stories, including "The Tale of the Three Brothers" which is the story of the Deathly Hallows.Amazon.com released an exclusive collector's edition of the book which is a replica of the book that Amazon.com purchased at auction in December 2007.[122] Seven copies were auctioned off in London by Sothebys. Each was illustrated and handwritten by Rowling and is 157 pages. It was bound in brown Moroccan leather and embellished with five hand-chased hallmarked sterling silver ornaments and mounted moonstones.[123] 1 Contents

The Hunger Games is a 2012 American science fiction film directed by Gary Ross, based on the novel of the same name by Suzanne Collins. The film was produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik, with a screenplay by Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray. It stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland.[5]The story takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future in the nation of Panem, where boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 18 must participate in the Hunger Games, a televised annual event in which the "tributes" are required to fight to the death until there is one remaining victor. The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence), volunteers to take her younger sister's place in the games. Joined by her district's male tribute Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson), Katniss travels to the Capitol to train for the Hunger Games under the guidance of former victor Haymitch Abernathy (Harrelson).The film was released on March 21, 2012, in France[6] and in the US on March 23, 2012,[7] in both conventional theaters and digital IMAX theaters.[8] Japan received it last, on September 28. When the film released, it set records for opening day ($67.3 million) and opening weekend for a non-sequel.[9] At the time of its release, the film's opening weekend gross ($152.5million) was the third-largest of any movie in North America.[10] It is the first film since Avatar to remain in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends.[11] The movie was a massive box-office success by grossing $685 million worldwide against its budget of $78 million.[4] It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 18, 2012.[12]The Hunger Games received positive reviews, with praise for its themes and messages, as well as Lawrence's performance as Katniss. Like the novel, the film has attracted criticism for its similarities to other works, such as the Japanese novel Battle Royale, its film adaptation, and the Shirley Jackson short story "The Lottery." Collins' novel and screenplay draw on sources of inspiration such as the myth of Theseus, Roman gladiatorial games, reality television, and the desensitization of viewers to media coverage of real-life tragedy and war, not to think as just an audience member, "Because those are real people on the screen, and theyre not going away when the commercials start to roll."[13]Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, accompanied by their frequently drunk mentor and past victor, Haymitch Abernathy. He warns them about the "Career" tributes who train intensively at special academies and almost always win.During a TV interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta unexpectedly reveals his love for Katniss. She is outraged, believing it to be a ploy to gain audience support, as "sponsors" may provide in-Games gifts of food, medicine and tools. However, she discovers Peeta meant what he said.The televised Games begin with half of the tributes killed in the first few minutes; Katniss barely survives ignoring Haymitch's advice to run away from the melee over the tempting supplies and weapons strewn in front of a structure called the Cornucopia. Peeta forms an uneasy alliance with the four Careers. They later find Katniss and corner her up a tree. Rue, hiding in a nearby tree, draws her attention to a poisonous tracker jacker nest. Katniss drops it on her sleeping besiegers. They all scatter, except for Glimmer, who is killed by the insects. Hallucinating due to tracker jacker venom, Katniss is warned to run away by Peeta. Rue cares for Katniss until she recovers.Meanwhile, the alliance has gathered up all the supplies. Katniss has Rue draw them off, then destroys the stockpile by setting off the mines planted around it. Furious, Cato kills the boy assigned to guard it. Katniss frees Rue from a trap, then dodges a spear thrown by Marvel; it strikes Rue. Katniss kills Marvel, then comforts the dying Rue with a song. Afterward, she gathers and arranges flowers around the body. When this is televised, it sparks a riot in Rue's District 11. Panem President Snow summons Seneca Crane, the Gamemaker, to express his displeasure at the way the Games are turning out.Since Katniss and Peeta have been portrayed as "star-crossed lovers", Haymitch convinces Crane to make a rule change to avoid further unrest. It is announced that tributes from the same district can win as a pair. Upon hearing this, Katniss searches for Peeta and finds him with an infected sword wound in the leg. She pretends to be deeply in love with him and gains a sponsor's gift of soup. An announcer proclaims a feast, where the thing each survivor needs most will be provided. Peeta begs her not to risk getting him medicine. Katniss promises not to go, but after he falls asleep, she heads to the feast. Clove ambushes her, pins her, and gloats. Thresh, the other District 11 tribute, kills Clove after overhearing her tormenting Katniss about killing Rue. He spares Katniss in Rue's memory. The medicine works, keeping Peeta mobile.Foxface, the girl from District 5, dies from eating nightlock berries she stole from Peeta; neither knew they are poisonous. Without warning, Crane darkens the arena and unleashes a pack of hound-like creatures to speed things up. They kill Thresh. Katniss and Peeta flee to the roof of the Cornucopia, where they have to fight Cato. Katniss wounds Cato with an arrow and Peeta hurls him to the creatures below. Katniss shoots Cato to spare him a prolonged death. With Peeta and Katniss apparently victorious, the rule change allowing two winners is suddenly revoked. Peeta tells Katniss to shoot him. Instead, she gives him half of the nightlock. Before they can commit suicide, they are hastily proclaimed the victors of the 74th Hunger Games.Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made powerful enemies with her display of defiance. She and Peeta return home, while Crane is locked in a room with a bowl of nightlock berries, and President Snow ponders the situation.In March 2009, Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement for The Hunger Games with Nina Jacobson's production company Color Force, which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier,[25][26] reportedly for $200,000.[27] Alli Shearmur and Jim Miller, President and Senior Vice President of Motion Picture Production at Lionsgate, took charge of overseeing the production of the film, which they described as "an incredible property... a thrill to bring home to Lionsgate."[28] The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000  one of its largest ever[29]  for the film.[27][30] Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that "they [Lionsgate] had everyone but the valet call us" to help secure the franchise.[30] Lionsgate subsequently acquired tax breaks of $8million for shooting the film in North Carolina.[30] The production was eventually brought in under-budget at $78million.[31]Collins adapted the novel for film herself,[25] in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross.[32][33] The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel,[34] with Ross saying he "felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective", echoing Collins' presentation of the novel in the first person present.[35] Instead of Katniss' internal monologue about the Capitol's machinations, the screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience. Ross explained, "In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers manipulations... in the film, we can't get inside Katnisss head, but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game center and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was tonally important."[35] Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that "I thought that it was very interesting that there would be one generation [of Panem citizens] who knew that [the Games] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's really where the tension is".[36]The Gamemakers' control center, about which Katniss can only speculate in the novel, was also developed as a location, helping to remind the audience of the artificial nature of the arena. Ross commented that, "so much of the film happens in the woods that it's easy to forget this is a futuristic society, manipulating these events for the sake of an audience. The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room."[35] Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggan were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggan explained that "we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie? we wanted to find a way to introduce them without having to explain specifically and exactly what they were and the game room was a really great opportunity for us to be able to do that."[37]Lionsgate confirmed in March 2011 that about 30 actresses auditioned or read for the role of Katniss Everdeen, including Hailee Steinfeld, Abigail Breslin, Emma Roberts, Saoirse Ronan, Chlo Grace Moretz, Jodelle Ferland, Lyndsy Fonseca, Emily Browning, Shailene Woodley, and Kaya Scodelario.[3][38] On March 16, 2011 it was announced that Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence of the indie film Winter's Bone had landed the coveted role.[39] Ross described Lawrence as having "an incredible amount of self-assuredness, you got the sense that this girl knew exactly who she was. And then she came in and read for me and just knocked me out; I'd never seen an audition like that before in my life. It was one of those things where you just glimpse your whole movie in front of you."[37]Though Lawrence was 20 when filming began, four years older than the character,[40] Collins said that the role demanded "a certain maturity and power" and said she would rather the actress be older than younger.[41] She added that Lawrence was the "only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book" and that she had "every essential quality necessary to play Katniss."[42] Lawrence, a fan of the books, took three days to accept the role, initially intimidated by the size of the production.[3][43]Contenders for the role of Peeta other than Hutcherson included Alexander Ludwig (who was later cast as Cato), Hunter Parrish, Lucas Till, and Evan Peters.[44] Other actors considered for the role of Gale included David Henrie, Drew Roy, and Robbie Amell.[44] In April 2011, John C. Reilly was in talks with Lions Gate Entertainment to portray Haymitch Abernathy, former victor of a Hunger Games held years before and mentor to Katniss and Peeta.[45] The following month Lionsgate announced that the role had gone to Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson.[17] The casting of Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman, and Toby Jones as Claudius Templesmith, soon followed. Multiple-Golden Globe award winner Donald Sutherland completed the major characters, cast as President Coriolanus Snow in late May 2011.[46]Gary Ross became director in November 2010.[47][48] Fireman's Fund Insurance Company insured the production, but as part of the underwriting process insisted on a thorough risk analysis of hazards as diverse as wayward arrows, poison ivy, bears, bugs, and a chase across fast-running water.[49]Lawrence dyed her blonde hair dark for the part of Katniss.[50] She also underwent extensive training to get in shape for the role, including archery, rock and tree climbing, combat, running, parkour, and yoga,[51] and experienced an accident on the last day of her six week training phase, in which she hit a wall while running at full speed, but was not seriously injured. Other stars who dyed their hair for the movie include Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, and Liam Hemsworth as Gale.[3] Lionsgate hired archer (and Olympic bronze medalist) Khatuna Lorig to teach Lawrence how to shoot.[49]With an initial budget of $75million,[52] principal photography began near Brevard in Transylvania County in Western North Carolina in May 2011[53] and concluded on September 15, 2011, with a final budget reported as between $90 and $100million, reduced to $78million after subsidies.[1][3] Steven Soderbergh served as a second unit director,[54] and filmed much of the District 11 riot scene.[55] The movie was shot on film as opposed to digital due (in part) to the tightness of the schedule; as Ross said in an interview with The New York Times, "I didn't want to run the risk of the technical issues that often come with shooting digitally  we simply couldn't afford any delays."[56]Virtually all production photography took place in North Carolina, with Lionsgate receiving tax credits of around $8million from the state government to do so. Forbes magazine estimated that the state economy gained up to $60million from the production, with over 5,000 people employed as extras, crew and support staff.[57] Most outdoor scenes, both from the arena and from the outskirts of District 12, were filmed in DuPont State Forest; the Little River, with its multiple waterfalls, provided several locations for shooting the river running through the arena.[58] The production team built a walkway across the top of Triple Falls for Lawrence to run over the rapids during Katniss' pursuit by the Career tributes.[59]Many of the urban and interior locations, in the Capitol and elsewhere, were filmed in Shelby and Charlotte. Ross and production designer Phil Messina drew on the buildings of the 1939 New York World's Fair and symbols of political power including Tiananmen Square and Red Square, when designing the Capitol architecture, which they wanted "to be set in the future but have a sense of its own past... it's festive and alluring and indulgent and decadent but it also has to have the kind of might and power behind it".[60][61] For Katniss' neighborhood in District 12, the production team found Henry River Mill Village, an abandoned mill town which Ross said "just worked perfectly for the movie to evoke the scene"; Messina explained that "originally we talked about maybe building one house and the facade of the house next door and redressing it, and maybe doing some CG extensions... we ended up finding a whole abandoned mill town... it was absolutely perfect."[61]The film has been rated 12A by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) in the UK for "intense threat, moderate violence and occasional gory moments".[2] To achieve that rating, Lionsgate had to cut or substitute seven seconds of film by "digitally removing blood splashes and the sight of blood on wounds and weapons".[62] In the United States, the movie was granted a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)[63] for "intense violent thematic material and disturbing images  all involving teens"; as Collins had originally anticipated.[64]The soundtrack album for the The Hunger Games contains songs inspired by the film; only three of them appear in the film itself, during the closing credits.[65] The first single from the film's companion album, "Safe & Sound" by Taylor Swift featuring The Civil Wars, was released on December 23, 2011.[66] It reached number one on the iTunes overall charts in 12 hours.[citation needed] The music video for "Safe & Sound" was released on February 13, 2012. Along with separate songs from Swift and The Civil Wars, the soundtrack also features songs by The Decemberists, Arcade Fire, The Secret Sisters, Miranda Lambert featuring The Pistol Annies,[67] Neko Case,[68] Kid Cudi[67] Academy Award winner Glen Hansard,[67] The Low Anthem,[67] Punch Brothers,[67] Birdy,[67] Maroon 5, Jayme Dee,[67] and Carolina Chocolate Drops.[67] The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012.[69] The soundtrack track list was revealed on iTunes on February 13, 2012, and on the 14th "One Engine" was released as the second single. Jennifer Lawrence singing "Rue's Lullaby" was not included on the soundtrack. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, having sold 175,000 copies in its first week. It was the first since Michael Jackson's This Is It to debut at #1. It is one of just 16 soundtracks to grace the top slot in the history of the Top 200.Lionsgate originally announced that Danny Elfman and T-Bone Burnett would score The Hunger Games, with Burnett also acting as the film's executive music producer to produce songs for the soundtrack.[70] Due to scheduling conflicts, Elfman was replaced by James Newton Howard.[71] The score album was released on March 26, 2012.[72]Arcade Fire also contributed to the movie's original score. The group composed the grand, fascistic-inspired, ominous Panem national anthem, entitled "Horn of Plenty", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film.[73][74] "We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise," Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. "And there's an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It's like the Capitol's idea of itself, basically."[73][74] He further added that "it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [Hunger] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film."[73][74] Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to Spin Mobile, ""Horn of Plenty" pulls off the neat feat of sounding both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem. It still has one foot in the band's uncorrupted neighborhoods, but another is up on the podium at the end of Star Wars accepting an Olympic gold medal or something. Horns blare, a choir booms, strings swell, the martial percussion steals the show, and we just realized how much we love Big Brother."[75]The film also featured a rather obscure analog track from the 1970s composed by Laurie Spiegel for its "cornucopia scene."[76]The album reached a peak of 71st on the Canadian Albums Chart.[77]The Hunger Games received positive reviews. Based on 266 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 85% "Certified Fresh" rating and an average score of 7.2 out of 10. The site's consensus reads "thrilling and superbly acted, The Hunger Games captures the dramatic violence, raw emotion, and ambitious scope of its source novel".[78] On Metacritic, the film has a 67 out of 100, indicating "generally favorable reviews", based on reviews from 44 critics.[79] Many critics praised Jennifer Lawrence for her portrayal as Katniss Everdeen, as well as most of the main cast. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Lawrence embodies Katniss, "just as one might imagine her from the novel".[80] Empire magazine said "Lawrence is perfect as Katniss, there's very little softness about her, more a melancholy determination that good must be done even if that requires bad things."[80] Several critics have reviewed the film favorably compared with other young-adult fiction adaptations such as Harry Potter and Twilight. Justin Craig of Fox News rated the film as "[e]xcellent" and stated: "Move over Harry Potter. A darker, more mature franchise has come to claim your throne."[81] Rafer Guzman of Newsday referred to The Hunger Games as being "darker than 'Harry Potter,' more sophisticated than 'Twilight'."[82] David Sexton of The Evening Standard stated that The Hunger Games "is well cast and pretty well acted, certainly when compared with Harry Potter's juvenile leads."[83]Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, praising the movie as "effective entertainment" and Lawrence's performance. Despite being a largely positive review, he criticized the film for being too long and noted that the film misses opportunities for social criticism.[84] Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy gave the film four stars out of five, calling it "enthralling from beginning to end, science fiction that has depth and intelligence to match its pulse-racing entertainment value". Reynolds also spoke highly of Lawrence's performance and director Gary Ross, whose "rough and ready handheld camerawork" meant that viewers were "with Katniss for every blood-flecked moment of her ordeal in the combat arena".[85] However, film critic David Thomson of the magazine The New Republic called it a "terrible movie", criticizing it for a lack of character development and unclear presentation of the violence, describing the latter as "un-American".[86]Eric Goldman of IGN awarded the film four out of five stars, stating that director Gary Ross "gets the tone of The Hunger Games right. This is a grounded, thoughtful and sometimes quite emotional film, with its dark scenario given due weight. Ross doesn't give the film a glossy, romanticized 'Hollywood' feel, but rather plays everything very realistically and stark, as Katniss must endure these outrageous and horrible scenarios."[87] The film received some criticism for its shaky camera style, but it was said to "add to the film in certain ways".[87] The violence drew commentary as well, Time critic Mary Pols considered that the film was too violent for young children, even though the violence had been toned down compared with the novel,[88] while critic Thoden Janes of the Charlotte Observer found that "[...] the violence is so bland it dilutes the message".[89] Also writing in Time, psychologist Christopher J. Ferguson argued that parents' fears of the effect of the film's violent content on their children were unnecessary, and that children are capable of viewing violent content without being psychologically harmed.[90] Both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson were praised for their portrayals as Katniss and Peeta. Many critics also praised Isabelle Fuhrman's chilling portrayal of "Clove", identifying her as a break-out star.[91]On February 22, 2012, The Hunger Games broke the record for first-day advance ticket sales on Fandango, topping the previous record of Eclipse. The sales were reported to be 83percent of the site's totals for the day.[92] According to first tracking, unaided awareness for The Hunger Games was 11%, definite interest was 54%, first choice was 23% and total awareness was 74%.[93] In the week leading up to its release, the film sold-out over 4,300 showings via Fandango and MovieTickets.com[94] On Fandango alone it ranks as the third-highest advance ticket seller ever behind New Moon and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  Part 2.[95] Finally, according to Fandango it broke the site's single-day sales record (March 23), the mobile sales record for a weekend (March 2325, 2012) and the site's highest share of a film's opening weekend (Fandango sold 22% of the film's opening weekend tickets).[96]The Hunger Games earned $408,010,692 in North America, and $278,522,598 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $686,533,290.[4] It made the largest worldwide opening weekend for a film not released during the summer or the holiday period, earning $211.8million, which was just ahead of Alice in Wonderland's previous record ($210.1million).[97]In North America, The Hunger Games is the thirteenth highest-grossing film, the highest-grossing film released outside the summer or holiday period,[98] and the highest-grossing film distributed by Lionsgate.[99] The film set a midnight-gross record for a non-sequel ($19.7million), which is also the seventh-highest midnight gross overall.[100] On its opening day, it made $67.3million (including midnight showings), setting opening-day and single-day records for a non-sequel, both of which were later surpassed by Marvel's The Avengers.[9] The film also achieved the sixth highest opening-day and seventh highest single-day grosses of all time.[101][102][103] On its opening weekend, the movie grossed $152.5million, breaking Alice in Wonderland's opening-weekend records for a film released in March, for any spring release, and for a non-sequel  the latter surpassed by The Avengers.[99][104][105][106] Its opening weekend gross is also the largest for any film released outside the summer season and the fourth-largest of all time overall.[107] It remained in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since Avatar to achieve this.[11][108][109] On June 10, 2012 (its 80th day in theaters), it became the 14th movie to pass the $400-million-mark.[110] On April 20, 2012, Lionsgate and IMAX Corporation announced that due to "overwhelming demand", The Hunger Games would return to North American IMAX cinemas on April 27 for a further one-week engagement.[111]Outside North America, the film was released in most countries during March and April 2012,[112] with the exception of China, where it was released in June 2012.[113] On its first weekend (March 2325, 2012), the film topped the box office outside North America with $59.25million from 67 markets, finishing at first place in most of them.[114] The largest opening weekends were recorded in China ($9.6 million),[113] Australia ($9.48million), and the UK, Ireland and Malta ($7.78 million).[112][115] In total earnings, its highest-grossing markets after North America are the UK, Ireland and Malta ($36.5 million), Australia ($31.1 million), and Germany ($20.0 million).[112]The film was released in North America and the Netherlands on DVD and Blu-ray August 18, 2012 and in the rest of Europe on September 3, 2012. Extras include 'The World is Watching: The Making of The Hunger Games', numerous featurettes, the propaganda video in its entire form, a talk with the director Gary Ross and also Elvis Mitchell and a marketing archive.In its first weekend on sale, Lionsgate reported that 3.8 million DVD/Blu-ray copies of the movie were sold, with more than one-third in the Blu-ray format.[116] Three weeks after the release of the movie to home media formats in the US, over 5 million DVD units and 3.7 million Blu-ray units have been sold.[117][118]Charles McGrath, writing for The New York Times, said that the film will remind viewers of the television series Survivor, a little of The Bachelorette, and of the short story "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson published in 1948 by The New Yorker.[119] David Sexton of The Evening Standard compared The Hunger Games unfavourably to Kinji Fukasaku's Japanese film Battle Royale, as did several other critics;[83][120][121][122][123] the novel had earlier faced criticism for its similarities to the novel Battle Royale by Koushun Takami.[124] Jonathan Looms of The Oxford Student argues that it is "unfair that the film is only drawing comparisons with Battle Royale" but that it "is a veritable pastiche of other movies" as well, comparing it to The Truman Show, Death Race, the Bourne films, and Zoolander, and that it is common for artists to borrow from and "improve on many sources. Quentin Tarantino has built his career on this principle."[125] It reminded an author at Salon of the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game.[126]Wheeler Winston Dixon, a film professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, listed several precedents: Battle Royale, Jackson's "The Lottery", William Golding's Lord of the Flies, Metropolis, Blade Runner, Death Race 2000, and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.[127] Manohla Dargis in The New York Times compares it to Battle Royale, Ender's Game, and Twilight, but contrasts The Hunger Games in terms of how its "exciting" female protagonist Katniss "rescues herself with resourcefulness, guts and true aim."[128] Steve Rose of The Guardian refers to the film as "think Battle Royale meets The Running Man meets Survivor."[129] Writing in The Atlantic, Govindini Murty made a list of touchstones the film alludes to, from the ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian civilizations to modern references such as the Great Depression, the Vietnam and Iraq Wars, and reality television.[130] For her part, author Collins cites the myth of Theseus, reality television and coverage of the Iraq War as her inspiration.[131][132][133]During the film's opening weekend, controversial statements about various members of the cast arose, sparking open dialog about issues of racism, sexism and unrealistic body image. In a Jezebel article published March 26, 2012, Dodai Stewart reported that several users on Twitter posted racist tweets, criticizing the portrayals of Rue, Thresh and Cinna by African American actors.[134][135] In a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Collins stated that while she did not have any ethnic background in mind for lead characters Katniss and Gale because the book is written in "a time period where hundreds of years have passed" and there would be "a lot of ethnic mixing", she explains "there are some characters in the book who are more specifically described", and states that both Rue and Thresh are African American.[136] Lyneka Little of The Wall Street Journal states that although it is easy to find bigoted or offensive postings online, "the racist 'Hunger Games' tweets, because they are so shockingly ignorant even by the standards of the fringes of the internet, have kicked up a storm."[137] Fahima Haque of The Washington Post, Bim Adewunmi of The Guardian, and Christopher Rosen of The Huffington Post all reiterate the fact that Rue and Thresh are described in The Hunger Games as having dark brown skin, as well as Collins' assertion that they were intended to be depicted as African Americans.[134][138][139] Adewunmi remarked that "it comes to this: if the casting of Rue, Thresh and Cinna has left you bewildered and upset, consider two things. One: you may be a racist  congrats! Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!"[139] Erik Kain of Forbes saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech. He states that while society may never be free of racism, "racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record. Aggregations of these comments, like the Jezebel piece, expose people for what they are. Sure, many hide under the cloak of anonymity, but many others cannot or choose not to. And as the internet becomes more civilized and its denizens more accountable, this sort of thing carries more and more weight."[135] Amandla Stenberg responded to the controversy with the following statement: "As a fan of the books, I feel fortunate to be part of The Hunger Games family... It was an amazing experience; I am proud of the film and my performance. I want to thank all of my fans and the entire Hunger Games community for their support and loyalty."[140] Dayo Okeniyi was quoted saying "I think this is a lesson for people to think before they tweet" and "It's sad... We could now see where society is today. But I try not to think about stuff like that."[141]A number of critics expressed disappointment in Jennifer Lawrence's casting as Katniss because her weight was not representative of a character who has suffered a life of starvation. Manohla Dargis, in her review of the film for The New York Times stated "[a] few years ago Ms. Lawrence might have looked hungry enough to play Katniss, but now, at 21, her seductive, womanly figure makes a bad fit for a dystopian fantasy about a people starved into submission."[142] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said that in certain scenes, Lawrence displays "lingering baby fat."[143] These remarks have been rebuked by a number of journalists for pushing unrealistic body image expectations for women.[144] L.V. Anderson of Slate states that "[j]ust as living in a world with abundant calories does not automatically make everyone fat, living in a dystopian world like Panem with sporadic food access would not automatically make everyone skinny. Some bodies, I daresay, would be even bigger than Lawrence's."[145] Since none of Lawrence's male co-stars have come under the same scrutiny, Anderson concludes complaints about Lawrence's weight are inherently sexist.[145] MTV asked for responses from audiences on the controversy and reported that most found criticism of Lawrence's weight "misguided."[146] One response pointed to Collins' physical description of Katniss in The Hunger Games novel which reads "I stand straight, and while I'm thin, I'm strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me."[147] Los Angeles Times writer Alexandra Le Tellier commented that "[t]he sexist commentary along with the racist barbs made by so-called fans are as stomach-churning as the film's cultural commentary, which, in part, shines a light on the court of public opinion and its sometimes destructive power to determine someone else's fate."[148]Screening of The Hunger Games has been delayed indefinitely in Vietnam.[149] The film was to be released on March 30, 2012, but, according to a member of the Vietnamese National Film Board, the Board considers the film to be too violent and unanimously voted for the indefinite delay. It is, in fact, banned.[150]There have also been comparisons between The Hunger Games premise of children killing each other, and the child soldiers of the Lord's Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony in the midst of the Kony 2012 campaign.[151][152][153]Interpretations of the film's themes and messages have been widely discussed among critics and other commentators. In his review for The Washington Times, Peter Suderman expressed that "[m]aybe it's a liberal story about inequality and the class divide. Maybe it's a libertarian epic about the evils of authoritarian government. Maybe it's a feminist revision on the sci-fi action blockbuster. Maybe it's a bloody satire of reality television", but concludes the film only proposes these theories and brings none of them to a reasonable conclusion.[167]Reviewers and critics have differing views on whether the film represents feminist issues. Historically, among the "top 200 worldwide box-office hits ever ($350million and up), not one has been built around a female action star."[168] Manohla Dargis sees Katniss Everdeen as a female hero following in the lineage of "archetypal figures in the literature of the American West" such as Natty Bumppo, as well as characters portrayed by American actors such as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood.[169] Katniss is also seen as defying normative gender roles: she exhibits both "masculine" and "feminine" traits equally.[169] Dargis also notes that Katniss is a female character with significant agency: "Katniss is a fantasy figure, but partly what makes her powerful  and, I suspect, what makes her so important to a lot of girls and women  is that she's one of the truest feeling, most complex female characters to hit American movies in a while. She isn't passive, she isn't weak, and she isn't some random girl. She's active, she's strong and she's the girl who motivates the story."[169] Similarly, Shelley Bridgeman of The New Zealand Herald wrote that because the characteristics of "athleticism, strength, courageousness and prowess at hunting" are not given to a male protagonist, but to Katniss, her character is an abrupt departure from the stereotypical depiction of women as being innately passive or helpless.[170] Mahvesh Murad of the The Express Tribune said that the film's triumph is "a young female protagonist with agency", comparing her with Joss Whedon's Buffy Summers.[171]Kate Heartfield of the Ottawa Citizen does not share the view that the film, or the books on which it is based, is feminist. Despite being a blockbuster film with a female lead possessing masculine characteristics, Heartfield argues, The Hunger Games fails to challenge patriarchal or orthodox paradigms.[172] As evidence for her claim, Heartsfield points to the fact that Katniss is torn between her feelings for two male love interests, a trait she shares with Bella Swan of the The Twilight Saga, with whom she is often compared and contrasted.[172] Heartfield asserts that while Katniss may be an exceptional character, "she isn't threatening to our social order. There's no controversy over women taking up archery or martial arts. There is controversy these days in the United States over access to birth control. The relationship between female power in The Hunger Games and the real feminist battles of 2012 is comfortably remote."[172]The film has drawn varying interpretations for its political overtones, including arguments in favor of left-wing, right-wing, and libertarian viewpoints. Bob Burnett of The Huffington Post observed the film displays a general distrust of government, regardless of the audience's political party affiliation.[173] Steven Zeitchik and Emily Rome, in the Dallas Morning News, also stated that some viewers formed an opinion about The Hunger Games as a parable of the Occupy Wall Street activity.[174] The Huffington Post reported that Penn Badgley, a supporter of Occupy Wall Street, saw the film as a social commentary on the movement.[175] Burnett also states that "Collins doesn't use the terms 1percent and 99percent, but it's clear that those in the Capitol are members of the 1percent and everyone in the Panem districts is part of the 99percent".[173]Steven Zeitchik and Emily Rome, in the Los Angeles Times and the Dallas Morning News reported that, among other disparate interpretations, some viewers saw The Hunger Games as a Christian allegory.[176][177] Jeffrey Weiss of the Star Tribune has remarked on what he saw as the intentional absence of religion in The Hunger Games universe, and has commented that whilst the stories contain no actual religion, people are "find[ing] aspects that represent their own religious values" within it.[178] Donald Brake from The Washington Times, as well as Andy Langford, senior pastor at Central United Methodist Church in Concord, North Carolina and his daughter, Ann G. L. Duncan, a pastor at Hoyle Memorial United Methodist Church in Shelby, North Carolina, wrote that the film has Christian themes, such as that of self-sacrifice, which is found in Katniss' substitution for her younger sister, analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus as a substitute for the atonement of sins.[179][180] Brake, as well as another reviewer, Amy Simpson, both find that the film also revolves around the theme of hope, which is exemplified in the "incorruptible goodness of Katniss' sister, Primrose."[181] She also describes that Peeta Mellark is "a Christ figure" in the film.[182] Similar to the events in the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus, in the Games, Peeta is stabbed and left for dead after saving Katniss' lifetaking the wound that was initially meant for herand is then buried in the ground and placed in a cave for three days before emerging with a new lease on life.[183] Moreover, the Christian image of the Bread of Life is used throughout The Hunger Games; in the film, Peeta shows up "bearing a warm loaf of bread," and Katniss slowly comes "back to life."[184] A news video starring Jonathan Morris aired on Fox News discussed the religious themes in the film further.[185] In addition, many pastors have written Bible studies discussing the Christian allegories in the film.[186][187]On August 8, 2011, while still shooting the film, Lionsgate announced that a film adaptation of the second novel in The Hunger Games trilogy, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, is scheduled to be released on November 22, 2013.[188] In November 2011, Lionsgate entered negotiations with screenwriter Simon Beaufoy to adapt the novel for screen, since the post-production schedule for The Hunger Games was too crowded for Ross and Collins to adapt the next film as originally planned.[189] The Hunger Games: Catching Fire will begin production in the summer of 2012.[190] Gary Ross will not return for Catching Fire, and instead Francis Lawrence will direct.[191][192][193][194] On May 6, 2012, it was reported that Michael Arndt was in talks to re-write the script for Catching Fire.[195] Arndt officially signed on as the new script writer on May 24, 2012.[196]In July 2012, release dates were confirmed for two films based on the last book Mockingjay. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 will be released November 21, 2014 and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2 will be released November 20, 2015.[197] Lawrence, Hutcherson, Hemsworth, and Harrelson have all signed on to the whole franchise.[3][198] The Hunger Games: Catching Fire began filming September 10, 2012.[199]March 12, 2012(2012-03-12) (Premiere)March 22, 2012(2012-03-22) (Philippines)March 23, 2012(2012-03-23) (United States)1 Plot2 Cast3 Production

GMA News and Public Affairs (commonly GMA News; formerly RBS News Department, GMA Radio-Television News and GMA Rainbow Satellite News) is the news department of the Philippine broadcaster GMA Network and its sister network GMA News TV. It produces news and infotainment programs for all GMA Network owned and affiliated television and radio stations in the Philippines, and internationally through GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV. GMA News and Public Affairs is currently headed by Marissa Flores. It is headquartered at the Ground Floor of GMA Network Center in Quezon City.[1]The GMA News division traces its origin from the Republic Broadcasting System, established by Robert Stewart in 1959. Programming of its radio station, DZBB depended on mostly on news reports. The station covered the eruption of Mt. Hibok-Hibok in 1951, and the election and death of former President Ramon Magsaysay. While RBS Channel 7 was established in 1961, it was in 1970s that GMA became one of the most-watched television news source in the country. In 1983, Channel 7 was the first to break the news of Ninoy Aquino's death, and later would be the only television station to broadcast his funeral. The channel also became the first station to broadcast the Ramos-Enrile break-away that led to the People Power Revolt.In 1998, GMA teamed up with the Philippine Daily Inquirer to produce election coverage. Its flagship newscast, Saksi, won the 1999 Asian Television Awards and 2002 New York Festival awards for Best Newscast. In 2006, GMA News was praised by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo for its news coverage, and said that it was the reason for the network's high ratings. In the 2006 SWS Media Trust survey, GMA News garnered 60% of public trust, second only to rival ABS-CBN with 68%. But a similar Pulse Asia survey shows that GMA News is the more credible in the country and to key demographics. [1]GMA News became a pioneer in local television news in many ways. GMA was one of the pioneers of women in broadcast journalism. Tina Monzon-Palma was one of the first women co-anchors when she first presented News at Seven, one of the most-watched news programs in the 1970s and . Helen Vela was the first woman to anchor news in Tagalog for GMA Balita, and Mel Tiangco was the first late-night solo anchor for Frontpage. GMA was the first to broadcast an hourly news program, GMA News Live which is known today as the GMA Flash Report, and the first station to use a ticker for breaking news and traffic information. GMA News was also the first to use Electronic News Gathering Vans in the country in 1995. In 2004, it regularly began to use Satellite News Gathering facilities to reach more remote areas. It also covered major events in the country, such as the 1995 World Youth Day, 2003 World Meeting of Families, and 2000 Today.In celebration of the 50th Anniversary, GMA airs Limang Dekada: The GMA News 50th Anniversary Special on January 10, 2010 on GMA and January 31, 2010 on Q.GMAs Public Affairs division was established in 1987[2] when Tina Monzon-Palma, then head of GMA News recognized that a 30 minute newscast was not adequate and sufficient to inform the general Filipino public on what is happening to the recently established Aquino government after the historic People Power Revolution[3] in February 1986.[4] It started with five news personnel including Marissa La Torre Flores (now handles GMA News and Public Affairs as senior vice president) and held office inside the cameramens locker room before moving into the state-of-the-art GMA Network Center with no experience, equipment, camera and an improvised set broadcasting at the old GMA building in Edsa with only a passion to work attitude. Now with more than 500 news personnelhere and abroadand producing 16 of the most awarded programs on Philippine television today.The public affairs program Weekend With Velez, was the first network-produced program on GMA, afterward renamed to Velez This Week and was hosted by Jose Mari Velez. Later that year it was joined with other public affairs shows such as Firing Line with Teddy Benigno (later on hosted by Oscar Orbos); View Point with Dong Puno; Straight from the Shoulder hosted by Louie Beltran and The Probe Team by Che-Che Lazaro and Issues and Answers hosted by Art Borjal.From a makeshift and improvised set, the once GMA News garnered several honors and recognitions from local and international award-giving bodies, including two gold medals in the New York Festivals and their first Peabody Award in 1999,[5] one of the most distinguished merit in the broadcast industry, the only one awarded to an Asian country. The first Peabody was given for Kidney for Sale, an investigative work on the selling of kidneys in a depressed area along the coast of Manila Bay. The award also recognizes Marissa Flores as the executive producer and a team of producers, writers, directors and reporters, as well as Jessica Soho, Michelle Seva-Recto, Jay Taruc, Leogarda Sanchez and Rowel Cornejo, Melchor Quintos and Gregg Gonzales.When longest-running noontime show Eat Bulaga! celebrated its silver anniversary in 2004, Public Affairs co-produced Eat Bulaga history with noontime show's production company Television and Production Exponents, Inc. or TAPE, Inc., because one of News and Public Affairs personalities Mr. Arnold Clavio was a contestant in a former segment of noontime show. He hosted it and was co-hosted by his Unang Hirit co-host, Ms. Rhea Santos.Coinciding with its 20th anniversary in broadcasting excellence, GMA News and Public Affairs aired a documentary entitled 20: Dalawampung Taon ng GMA Public Affairs (20: Twenty Years of GMA Public Affairs) on October 28, 2007.[6]In 2010, The I-Witness won the George peabody award. The show is the documentary of Kara David.On December 9, 2003 the Philippine House of Representatives 12th Congress commended GMA News and Public Affairs through Resolution 787[7] authored by Rep. Rodolfo Plaza for its efforts in uplifting the standards of the Philippine broadcast industry by receiving the first Peabody Award gold medal for television news awarded to an Asian country in 1999.[8]1 History

The Legend of Korra is an American animated television series that premiered on the Nickelodeon television network on April 14, 2012.[2] It was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko as a sequel to their previous show, Avatar: The Last Airbender, which aired on the same network from 2005 to 2008. Like its predecessor, the series is set in a fictional world where some people are able to "bend"manipulate the elements of water, earth, fire, or air. Only one person, the "Avatar," can manipulate all four elements, and he or she is responsible for maintaining the balance in the world. The series follows Korra, the current incarnation of the Avatar, as she travels to the metropolis of Republic City to learn airbending and face an anti-bender revolutionary group called the "Equalists."[3][4]The series, whose style is strongly influenced by Japanese animation,[5] was announced at San Diego Comic-Con in 2010 as Avatar: Legend of Korra.[6] It was initially conceived as a miniseries of 12 episodes,[7] but is now set to run for 52 episodes separated into two seasons.[8] The creators separated each season into two "books," each of which tells a separate story. Several producers and voice actors from the previous series, including designer Joaquim Dos Santos and composer Jeremy Zuckerman, returned to work on The Legend of Korra.[9]The Legend of Korra was initially conceived as a 12-episode miniseries. Nickelodeon later expanded it to a full 26-episode season, and in July 2012 again to two 26-episode seasons. While Nickelodeon divides the series in two seasons for administrative purposes, the creators conceive of it as consisting of four separate "books" composed of 12 to 14 episodes ("chapters"), with each book telling a stand-alone story. The Legend of Korra is intended to conclude with the fourth book.[10]The Legend of Korra is set in the fictional world of Avatar: The Last Airbender. The world is separated into four nations: the (Northern and Southern) Water Tribes, the Air Nomads, the Earth Kingdom and the Fire Nation. The focus of the series is "bending," the ability of some humans (and animals) to telekinetically manipulate the element associated with their nation (water, earth, fire or air). Bending is carried out using spiritual and physical exercises, which are portrayed in the series as similar to Chinese and other Asian martial arts.Only one person, the "Avatar," can bend all four elements. Cyclically reincarnating among the world's four nations, the Avatar is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. Like its predecessor, The Legend of Korra focuses on the current incarnation of the Avatar: Korra, a 17-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe. At the start of the series, she has mastered waterbending, earthbending, and firebending, but must complete her training by learning airbending from Tenzin, the youngest child of Aang and Katara from the original series.[3]The series is mostly set in Republic City, the capital of the United Republic of Nations, a state that emerged after the end of the war that occurred in Avatar: The Last Airbender. Its capital, Republic City, a metropolis described as "what if Manhattan had happened in Asia" by the series' creators,[11] has become a melting pot for people of all nations. The residents are united by their passion for "pro-bending," a spectator sport in which two teams composed of one earthbender, waterbender, and firebender try to throw each other out of a ring using bending.The series opens with a montage introducing Korra as the Avatar and showing that she has mastered every element except airbending. It is then revealed that due to problems in Republic City, Tenzin will not be able to move to the Southern Water Tribe and teach Korra airbending. As a result, Korra sneaks out and runs away to Republic City so that Tenzin can train her there. Once there, Korra clashes with police chief Lin Beifong (the daughter of Toph from Avatar: The Last Airbender) after dispensing vigilante justice to the local triads. Shortly thereafter, the two main antagonists of the season are introduced: the Equalists, an underground activist movement; and Tarrlok, an ambitious politician. The Equalists are non-benders led by a mysterious masked man, Amon. Their goal is to bring about "equality" between benders and non-benders. Councilman Tarrlok believes in aggressive tactics for bringing the Equalists to justice, despite protests from his pacifist colleague Tenzin, Korra's airbending trainer. As Korra explores Republic City, she meets the brothers Mako and Bolin and joins their pro-bending team, the "Fire Ferrets." They are successful in the league, but romantic tensions among them and Asami, Mako's girlfriend, put a strain on their relationship.As the story progresses, Korra discovers that Amon has the power to remove a person's bending ability. Tarrlok cajoles Korra to join his anti-Equalist "task force," and the Equalists begin using terrorist tactics, climaxing in an attack on the pro-bending arena, where Amon strips the winning team of their bending. But when Tarrlok continues indiscriminately repressing non-benders, Korra refuses to continue supporting him. After Tarrlok imprisons her friends to blackmail her, they fight. Tarrlok overpowers Korra with bloodbending, an illegal form of waterbending, and kidnaps her, framing the Equalists. Tenzin, Lin, and Korra's friends eventually discover that Tarrlok is lying, but as they do Amon arrives at Tarrlok's hideout and removes Tarrlok's bending. Korra escapes, only to find Republic City facing an Equalist military coup.In the two-part finale of Book One: Air, naval reinforcements from the United Forces, led by Zuko's grandson Iroh, are defeated by Equalist sea mines and biplanes. Attempting to find Amon, Korra learns that Tarrlok and Amon are both sons of the bloodbender Yakone, who was defeated 42 years ago by Avatar Aang, as well as water- and bloodbenders. In a showdown with Amon at one of his rallies, Amon is able to strip Korra of her power to bend all elements but in desperation she unlocks her airbending. After Mako and Korra manage to overpower and publicly unmask Amon as a waterbender, Amon flees with Tarrlok, who later detonates their boat on the open sea. The despondent Korra finally manages to establish spiritual contact with her predecessor, Aang, who restores her bending powers, allowing her to do the same for Amon's other victims.The Legend of Korra was co-created and produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank, California. Animation work was mostly done by South Korean animation studio Studio Mir. Production of the series was announced at the annual Comic-Con in San Diego on July 22, 2010. It was originally due for release in October 2011.[6][12] Tentatively titled Avatar: Legend of Korra at the time, it was intended to be a twelve-episode[7] mini series set in the same fictional universe as the original show,[12] but seventy years later.[13] The show's premiere was delayed to April 14, 2012, to permit the addition of 14 episodes.[12] At the San Diego Comic-Con 2011, the creators confirmed that the first twelve episodes would constitute the first book and the other fourteen a second book. Also it was revealed that the title would be changed to The Last Airbender: Legend of Korra. In March 2012, it was renamed again to its final title: The Legend of Korra.The show is darker-themed than the original show, but with a balance between mature themes and a sense of fun and adventure. It was announced early on that the show's creators write all of the episodes themselves and that filler episodes would be omitted, allowing for a more concise story.[14] However, when the series was expanded from its original 12-episode schedule to 26 (and eventually 52), more writers were brought in so that the creators could focus on design work.[15] Joaquim Dos Santos and Kihyun Ryu, who worked on the animation and design of the original series, are also involved in this show, as is storyboarder Ian Graham. Jeremy Zuckerman, who composed the soundtrack for the original series as part of "The Track Team," also returned to score The Legend of Korra.[16]The Legend of Korra is produced mainly as traditional animation, with most frames drawn on paper in Korea by the animators at Studio Mir and scanned for digital processing. The series makes occasional use of computer-generated imagery for complex scenes, most noticeably in the animations of the pro-bending arena or the Satomobile factory.While The Legend of Korra is produced in the U.S. and therefore not a work of Japanese animation ("anime") in the strict sense, The Escapist magazine argued that the series is so strongly influenced by anime that it would otherwise easily be classified as such: Its protagonists (a superpowered heroine, her group of talented, supporting friends, a near-impervious villain who wants to reshape the world), its themes (family, friendship, fear, and death) and the quality of its voice acting as well as the style of its visuals are very similar to those of leading anime series such as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Bleach or Trigun.[5] A notable difference to such series is the absence of lengthy opening and ending sequences set to J-pop songs:[5] to save broadcast time, The Legend of Korra's openings and endings last only a few seconds. The series mostly abstains from using the visual tropes characteristic of anime, but does rarely use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.Like Avatar, The Legend of Korra is scored by The Track Team, the partnership of composers Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn. As with Avatar, no soundtrack album has been published or announced to date.Bryan Konietzko and Mike DiMartino's concept for the score was to blend traditional Chinese music with early jazz. On that basis, Zuckerman and Wynn composed a score combining elements of Dixieland, traditional Chinese music and Western orchestration, performed mainly by a string sextet and various Chinese solo instruments.[17]The first twelve episodes (Book 1: Air) of the first season aired in the U.S. on Nickelodeon between April 14, 2012 and June 23, 2012, and are available in the U.S. on the channel's website and through the Hulu Plus service. They are to be broadcast in other countries on the local Nickelodeon channels beginning in August 2012.In June 2012, Nickelodeon began producing the second part of the first season (Book 2: Spirits),[18][19] which is expected to air sometime in 2013.[19][20]In November 2012, the entertainment news website Hypable noted that a trailer for a The Legend of Korra DVD release had surfaced on the Internet. The trailer did not indicate when the DVD would become available.[21]Janet Varney was cast as Korra, the series' 17-year-old "headstrong and rebellious" protagonist,[1] and Aang's successor as the Avatar. Her character was inspired by Bryan Konietzko's "pretty tough" sister, and by female MMA fighters, notably Gina Carano.[19][22] The series focuses on Korra and her friends Mako, Bolin and Asami. Mako was named after Mako Iwamatsu, the voice actor for Iroh in the original series, who died during the production of Avatar: The Last Airbender's production. Mako is voiced by David Faustino and is described as "dark and brooding," having grown up on the streets.[1][23] His brother, Bolin, who is voiced by P. J. Byrne, has an opposite personality and is described as lighthearted, humorous, and "always having a lady on his arm."[1][24] Asami Sato, the only main character who is a non-bender, is voiced by Seychelle Gabriel. She is the only daughter of the wealthy industrialist Hiroshi Sato.[1] The other main characters are Korra's airbending teacher Tenzin, voiced by J. K. Simmons, and Republic City police chief Lin Beifong, voiced by Mindy Sterling. Additionally, Dee Bradley Baker, who voiced a number of animals in the original series, returned in The Legend of Korra to voice Naga and Pabu, Korra's and Bolin's animal friends. Pabu was inspired by Futa, a famous standing Japanese red panda.[25]Among the other recurring characters, the first to be introduced is Tenzin's wife Pema (Maria Bamford) and her children Jinora (Kiernan Shipka), Ikki (Darcy Rose Byrnes), Meelo (Logan Wells), and Rohan. Jinora and Ikki are both girls and airbenders. Jinora is calmer and an avid reader[26][27] and Ikki is described as "fun, crazy, and a fast talker."[27] Meelo (also an airbender) and Rohan (born during the finale of Book One: Air) are Pema's sons. Korra and her friends are supported by General Iroh, a firebender and General of the "United Forces." He is voiced by Dante Basco, the voice actor of Zuko in the original series, and is described as "a swashbuckling hero-type guy."[28][29][30] He is named after Iroh, Zuko's uncle in the original series.[18]Book One: Air features two main antagonists: Amon, the mysterious masked leader of the "Equalist" movement; and Tarrlok, a suave politician. Both are waterbenders, bloodbenders, and brothers who were raised in the Northern Water Tribe. Their father is Yakone, a criminal voiced by Clancy Brown who is seen in the series through Korra's visions of Republic City 42 years before the series' start. Amon, whose real name is Noatak, is voiced by Steve Blum. He is shown in the series to have the power to remove an individual's bending.[1][31] Tarrlok, who is also voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, is the Northern Water Tribe's representative on Republic City's governing council. He is an ambitious and charismatic politician who resorts to increasingly repressive methods to counter Amon and the Equalist movement.[32] Other recurring antagonists include the "Lieutenant" (Lance Henriksen), Amon's second-in-command, and Hiroshi Sato (Daniel Dae Kim), Asami's father who joins the Equalists because firebenders killed his wife. Sato is the self-made owner of Future Industries, a company that makes the series' version of the Model-T automobile: the "Satomobile." The character was inspired by Theodore Roosevelt and by the Japanese industrialists Keita Goto and Iwasaki Yatar.[33]David Hinckley of the New York Daily News wrote that the "visually striking" series is "full of little tricks and nuances that only true fans will notice and savor, but nothing prevents civilians from enjoying it as well."[34] Brian Lowry of Variety felt that the series "represents a bit more ambitious storytelling for older kids, and perhaps a few adults with the geek gene."[35] Prior to the first book's finale, Scott Thill of Wired hailed The Legend of Korra as "the smartest cartoon on TV," able to address adults' spiritual and sociopolitical concerns while presenting an "alternately riveting and hilarious ride packed with fantasy naturalism, steampunk grandeur, kinetic conflicts, sci-fi weaponry and self-aware comedy."[36] Thill proposed that the Equalists' cause reflected the recent issues in the Occupy movement, and DiMartino responded that though the series was written before Occupy Wall Street began, he agreed that the show similarly depicted "a large group of people who felt powerless up against a relatively small group of people in power."[37] Alyssa Rosenberg praised the show for examining issues of class in an urban setting, and a guest post in her column later argued that the struggle between Korra and Amon's Equalists reflected some of the ideas of John Rawls' "luck egalitarianism," praising the show for tackling moral issues of inequality and redistribution.[38][39]Elements of the first book that received particular praise were the exceptional quality of the animation, the background paintings[40] and the martial-arts action scenes,[41] as well as the series' innovative and engrossing visual design and style.[40] The writers were credited for finding a believable balance between magic and technology[42] and for their mature and nuanced portrayal of romantic relationships and conflicts.[43][41] Critics also praised the writers' willingness and ability to tackle difficult themes such as social unrest,[44] terrorism, Tarrlok's murdersuicide of Amon,[45] as well as (depending on the interpretation of a scene from the season finale) Korra considering suicide after losing her bending.[46][47][48]The first book overall, in particular the finale, received high praise by critics, but did get a few criticisms. Kotaku editor Kirk Hamilton, in a piece discussing his perceived flaws of the first season, wrote that he felt the series failed to tackle its central conflicts in a meaningful way, the mix of comedy and drama, the greater amount of character arcs in a shorter series, and the neat ending.[49] Raz Greenberg of Strange Horizons commented that Korra seemed as though she had things too easy in life in comparison to Aang, and also criticized the show's rapid pacing. [50] Max Nicholson of IGN largely praised the series' writing, animation, humor, setting, and characters, and even addressed criticisms of the ending by pointing out that several things accused of being a deus ex machina had been foreshadowed throughout the series. However, he did feel that the love triangle arc between Mako, Asami, and Korra fell flat and that the pro-bending arc felt superfluous while praising the way it led into the greater war arc with Amon. He also felt that Mako, despite being a major character, felt underwritten. Lauren Davis of io9 was extremely positive about the arc of the characters and the setting, though also felt disappointed about the show's pacing.[42]Book One: Air drew an average of 4.3 million viewers per episode. This was the highest audience total for an animated show in the U.S. in 2012.[51]Book One: Air is to be adapted as two novels by Erica David, aimed at readers aged twelve and up. The novelizations are to be published by Random House in 2013:[52]In August 2012, Variety reported that Paramount Animation, a sister company of Nickelodeon, was starting development of several animated movies, with budgets of around US$100 million. According to Variety, a possible candidate for one of the films is The Legend of Korra.[53] Series creator Bryan Konietzko wrote on his blog that while he and Michael Dante DiMartino "would love to write/direct an animated Korra feature film sometime," no such movie was in development.[54]Action/AdventureFantasy/SteampunkComedy-dramaMichael Dante DiMartinoBryan KonietzkoMichael Dante DiMartinoBryan KonietzkoJoaquim Dos SantosKi Hyun RyuJanet VarneyJ.

The Legend of Korra

The Legend of KorraThe Legend of Korra
How I Met Your Mother is an American sitcom that premiered on CBS on September 19, 2005, created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays, and directed by Pamela Fryman.Set in Manhattan, How I Met Your Mother follows the social and romantic lives of Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) and his friends Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), and Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris).[1] As a framing device, the main character, Ted,[1] using voiceover narration by Bob Saget, in the year 2030 recounts to his son and his daughter the events that led to his meeting their mother.Known for its unique structure and eccentric humor, How I Met Your Mother has been a critical success, having received positive reviews throughout most of its run. The show has been nominated for seven Emmy Awards, winning six. In 2012, the series won the People's Choice Award for Best TV Network Comedy and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Best Male Comedy Actor.[2]How I Met Your Mother was inspired by Carter Bays' and Craig Thomas' idea to "write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York."[3] The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[4][5] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her, but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work, and was available.[4]MacLaren's, a bar in the middle of New York, in which some of the show is set, is based on a bar named McGee's.[6] It has a mural that Bays and Thomas both liked and wanted to incorporate into the show.[7] The name for the bar is from Carter Bays' assistant, Carl MacLaren; the bartender in the show is also named Carl.[8]Each episode is usually shot over three days in the Los Angeles-based Soundstage Studio 22[9] and features upwards of 50 scenes with quick transitions and flashbacks. However, the "Pilot" episode was filmed at CBS Radford.[10] The laugh track is later created by recording an audience being shown the final edited episode. Thomas claims that shooting before a live audience would be impossible because of the structure of the show and the numerous flashforwards in each episode and because doing so "would blur the line between 'audience' and 'hostage situation'."[11] Later seasons started filming in front of an audience on occasion when smaller sets are used.The theme song is a portion of "Hey Beautiful" by The Solids, of which Bays and Thomas are members. Episodes from Season 1 generally started with the opening credits. A cold opening has been used since Season 2. Viewers then occasionally see Ted's children on a couch and hear him talking to them, telling the story of how he met their mother. Alternatively, scenes from previous episodes or shots of New York City with Ted narrating over the top are shown. Thomas has explicitly said Future Ted is an unreliable narrator since he is trying to tell a story that happened over 20 years earlier;[12] this has been a plot point in several episodes such as "The Goat", "Oh Honey", "How I Met Everyone Else" and "The Mermaid Theory". Nevertheless, Thomas has also emphasized maintaining a coherent and consistent universe, and trying to avoid continuity errors, based on his experiences of being a fan of other shows.[13]A scene directly relating to the identity of the mother, involving Ted's future children, was filmed near the beginning of Season 2 for the show's eventual series finale.[14] This was primarily done because the teenage actors portraying them will be adults by the time the final season is shot.[15]During the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike, How I Met Your Mother shut down production; but, when the strike ended, the show returned on March 17, 2008, with nine new episodes.[16] A change in timeslot was also announced, to 8:30 pm ET/7:30 pm CT, flip-flopping from the summer schedule with The Big Bang Theory.[17] CBS renewed the show for a fourth season on May 14, 2008,[18] which premiered on September 22, 2008.[19]In September 2008, it was announced that Lifetime Television had purchased the right to rerun How I Met Your Mother at a rate of about $725,000 per episode.[20] The four-year syndication contract stipulated that the studio deliver at least 110 half-hour episodes by the year 2010, and allowed for up to eight seasons of the show. At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[21] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was announced.[22] On May 20, 2009, CBS announced that How I Met Your Mother would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new comedy Accidentally on Purpose. On January 12, 2010, the show hit the milestone of its 100th episode. It was also announced that the series would return for a sixth season on CBS.[23] In response to being syndicated, Thomas said, "We're thrilled that it will live on in other forms," and they were proud of the show and it was great to see the strong demand.[24] However, cast members have suggested the show will run for no more than eight seasons.[25]On September 13, 2010, reruns of the series began airing on local U.S. broadcast television stations and on Chicago-based cable superstation WGN America. Featured in these airings are vanity cards previously unseen in the CBS and Lifetime airings due to marginalized credit sequences used by the two networks. Shown in between the closing credits and the production company credits, these vanity cards show portions of "The Bro Code", a list of rules frequently referenced by Harris' character, Barney Stinson, on how men should interact with each other, with an emphasis on activities involving pursuing members of the opposite sex. The opening theme song for the syndicated reruns is also slightly edited, running shorter and not using all the pictures seen in the opening montage that runs on DVD and the original CBS broadcasts. The episodes are also slightly edited, leaving out a few details.One of the series' ongoing traditions involves giving guest roles to actors from various Joss Whedon productions, many of whom co-starred with Hannigan on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Bays attributes this to their being "huge fans" and to those casts representing "a big talent pool".[26]Another tradition involves the use of euphemisms for culturally sensitive issues. These include eating a sandwich for smoking marijuana and reading a magazine for masturbating (in the bathroom, where one would read a magazine) and "playing the bagpipes" for loud, raucous sex acts. These euphemisms, among others, have been used extensively throughout the series and have even been used as central plot themes, such as the episode "Benefits" in Season 4.On March 4, 2011, CBS announced that the show had been renewed for two more seasons,[27] with the seventh season premiering with back-to-back episodes on September 19, 2011.[2]On July 27, 2011, it was announced that the FX channel had picked up the show for syndication. FX began airing the show on September 5, 2011.[28]In the year 2030, Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) sits his daughter and son down to tell them the story of how he met their mother.The series begins in 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from his college years; Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher and aspiring artist. Lily and Marshall have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall finally proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), whom he met in the restroom at a bar four years earlier. Barney is a serial womanizer who concocts elaborate con games, usually involving costumes and fake identities, designed to bed women, whom he discards immediately afterward.Ted begins his search for his perfect soul mate and meets an ambitious young reporter from Canada, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), with whom he quickly falls in love. Robin, however, doesn't want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Future Ted reveals that Robin is not the mother after referring to her as "Aunt Robin".Ted begins dating a baker, Victoria (Ashley Williams), whom he meets at a friend's wedding, causing Robin to become jealous and realize she does have feelings for Ted. Victoria, having been offered a fellowship in pastry-making, moves to Germany; and she and Ted try a long-distance relationship. Once Ted learns Robin has feelings for him, he tells her he broke up with Victoria, even though he hasn't. They almost have sex when Victoria calls and Robin answers, mistaking Ted's phone for her own. Ted and Victoria then break up and an angry Robin distances herself from Ted, but they eventually make up and decide to date.Meanwhile, Lily begins to wonder if she's missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall, and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking up with Marshall in the process. The season ends with Ted coming back to the apartment, the morning after spending the night with Robin for the first time, to find Marshall sitting in the rain with Lily's engagement ring, devastated by their sudden break up.Ted and Robin are now a couple; meanwhile, a heartbroken Marshall tries to continue his life without Lily. After enduring numerous emotional breakdowns, Marshall's friends step in, and Barney, using sly catch phrases and pick up lines, tries to get Marshall back in the dating game. Later, Lily, after finally realizing she is not meant to be an artist, returns to New York. She is reunited with Marshall, their engagement is reinstated. When Robin refuses to go to the mall or explain why, Marshall suspects she is married, and Barney suspects she has performed in adult films. They both bet on it, issuing Lily as "Slap Bet Commissioner." Lily oversees the search for the truth, as they discover that Robin was a teenage pop star named "Robin Sparkles", and Marshall eventually earns the right to slap Barney 5 times whenever he wants to. It is revealed Barney has a gay half-brother named James (Wayne Brady) and that he believes that Bob Barker is his father, unaware that his mother lied to him, and takes a trip to California to be a contestant on The Price is Right to meet his "father." While on the show, Barney wins all of the prizes and gives them to Lily and Marshall as a 'happy early wedding' present.In the season finale, Ted reveals to Barney that he and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on marriage and kids. They didn't tell anyone in order to avoid taking attention away from Lily and Marshall's wedding. The season ends with Barney excited at the prospect of Ted and himself being single guys on the town again, and ends the season with Barney saying, "This is going to be legen- wait for it..."Barney begins the season with the word, "-dary!" Robin returns from a trip to Argentina with her new boyfriend, Gael (Enrique Iglesias), and Ted must adjust to life as just her friend, while watching Robin and Gael fawning over each other. Marshall and Lily decide to move out on their own, falling in love with a place they can't afford. Robin learns of Lily's bad credit rating due to her compulsive shopping for designer brands, and forces Lily to tell Marshall. Despite this, they are able to finally secure their dream apartment, only to discover it's in a bad location and more poorly constructed than they thought (the floor is tilted). Barney is slapped for the third time on Thanksgiving, which Marshall dubs "Slapsgiving."Ted tells his children he met their mother through a story concerning her yellow umbrella. He finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick's Day party where his future wife was, although they did not meet. Ted attempts to woo Stella (Sarah Chalke), a dermatologist he sees to remove an embarrassing butterfly tattoo. This culminates in a memorable "two-minute date," which incorporates small talk, dinner, a movie, coffee, two cab rides, and a goodnight kiss, all within two minutes. Robin sleeps with Barney after he comforts her following a break-up with a past Canadian love; Ted is infuriated, and decides to stop being friends with Barney. Meanwhile, an unknown woman begins to sabotage Barney's attempts to hook up. His saboteur is revealed to be Abby (Britney Spears), Stella's receptionist, with a vendetta against him for not calling her after they had sex.In the season finale, Ted gets into a car accident and ends up in hospital, Subsequently Barney gets hit by a bus on the way to visit him and ends up receiving treatment in the same hospital. Ted realizes Barney really cares about him and they renew their friendship. It is revealed Barney has true feelings for Robin, while Ted proposes to Stella in an arcade.Stella says yes to Ted's proposal. Robin takes a new job in Japan, but quickly resigns and returns to New York to attend Ted's wedding, after realizing how much she misses her friends. Stella leaves Ted at the altar to get back together with Tony (Jason Jones), the father of her daughter. Barney struggles with his feelings for Robin as his company shifts him to the management team of a new acquisition, Goliath National Bank (GNB), where Marshall has accepted a position.Marshall and Lily move to their new apartment and debate over whether or not they're ready to have children. Robin becomes roommates with Ted and gets a job as an anchor for a 4 AM news show after Barney sends out her video resume. Ted and Robin decide to sleep together constantly so they won't fight over each other's bad co-living habits. Barney attempts to make them stop fighting to prevent this, revealing to Ted his love for Robin.Ted finds out Lily has sabotaged all of his relationships with anyone she doesn't approve of and indirectly may have inspired his breakup with Robin. Robin and Ted end up talking about it, causing their friendship to begin moving toward a positive note. After Barney finally sleeps with his 200th woman (and rubs it in the face of the childhood bully who taunted him into pursuing it), he begins to question the purpose of the remainder of his life, leaving him more certain of his feelings for Robin.Ted, while carrying the yellow umbrella, bumps into Stella and Tony. Tony later decides to visit him, sympathizing with Ted over his loss of Stella.

Hawaii Five-0 is an American police procedural drama television series and a re-imagining of the original 196880 television series. The series is produced by K/O Paper Products and 101st Street Television in association with CBS Productions. The title of the new show uses a zero in place of the letter "O" in the original title.[1]Hawaii Five-0 debuted on CBS, the same network that aired the original version. Like the original version, it follows an elite state police unit/task force set up to fight crime in the state of Hawaii. It premiered on Monday, September 20, 2010, 42 years to the day from the premiere of the original show, September 20, 1968. On October 21, 2010, CBS announced that Hawaii Five-0 had been given a full season order of 24 episodes.[2]On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed Hawaii Five-0 for a third season,[3] which premiered on September 24, 2012.[4]The series covers the actions of a small special state task force created by the Governor of Hawaii, Gov. Pat Jameson, to investigate serious crimes throughout the Islands, as Hawaii does not have a conventional state police force. The team is headed by Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett, USNR as it investigates crimes ranging from terrorism to kidnapping. McGarrett chooses as his partner Honolulu PD Detective Danny "Danno" Williams. He fills out the team by selecting Chin Ho Kelly, and Chin's cousin, a rookie HPD cop named Kono Kalakaua. The task force does not follow the normal chain of command and instead reports directly to the Governor's office. One unexplained part of the story concerns the name Five-0. Taken from a shirt worn by the young Steve McGarrett in a video that the team watches, Kono decides that Five-0 would be a good name for their task force. However, it is not explained how everyone (including tourists) seems to know what Five-0 is despite it being an unofficial name coined in a private meeting,[5][6] although the name appears to have been made official in later episodes. Five-0's headquarters are apparently located in Aliiolani Hale, site of a famous Kamehameha Statue, which features prominently in the series; in real life Aliiolani Hale serves as the central headquarters of the Hawai'i State Judiciary and where the Supreme Court of Hawaii regularly convenes.Each episode typically begins with a crime being committed or a body being discovered (although in one episode the team was assigned to provide protection for a foreign dignitary), and assignment of the subsequent criminal investigation to the unit by either the governor herself or her representative. The task force uses the authority of the governor's office to gain access to crime scenes and investigations involving the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) when they cross paths. To assist them in their investigations, the team is granted immunity from prosecution for actions committed in the line of duty, although this immunity is revoked by the lieutenant governor following the governor's assassination.A major character arc set up in the pilot episode revolves around the murder of McGarrett's father, who was working on a corruption case even after retiring from the HPD. After the terrorist responsible for his father's murder is apprehended, a mysterious figure interrogates him about Steve's investigation into his father's old cases. This figure is later revealed to be Wo Fat, a criminal with ties to the Japanese Yakuza, and is possibly connected to the suspected car-bomb murder of Steve's mother (a death originally ruled an accident). When his father investigated this as the head of the HPD Organized Crime Task Force, he began to dig too far into the corruption, forcing him to lay off the investigation. He nonetheless saved all his evidence in a toolbox, all of which was left to his son in the hope that he would someday conclude his father's work.Another character arc involves the reasons behind Chin Ho's departure from the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) after being accused of stealing cash from the HPD asset forfeiture locker. McGarrett accepts Chin Ho onto the task force, as he was his father's protg. As the series progresses, it is revealed that a mole within HPD framed Chin Ho for the theft, and that this mole was also possibly connected to McGarrett Sr.'s old corruption probe.In the season one finale, the Five-0 task force is disbanded after McGarrett is arrested for Governor Jameson's murder. However, in the second season, the new governor, Sam Denning, reinstates the task force after McGarrett is proven innocent; but the team no longer has absolute immunity and must follow the Governor's rules. Governor Denning appoints Lori Weston from the Department of Homeland Security to the Five-0 task force in episode 2 to monitor the team; she resigns after the task force is involved in a diplomatic incident at the Russian consulate.In season two, Masi Oka's Dr. Max Bergman, M.E., discovers his biological mother was the victim of a serial murderer who has started killing again. There was a cooling of relations between Rachel and Danny to the point, by the end of the season, where Danny was about to fight Rachel and her current husband Stan's plan to take Danny's daughter Grace with them on their move to the mainland. Kono is involved in an undercover assignment, for five episodes, where she appeared to have lost her badge, but was actually working HPD Internal Affairs Capt. Vincent Fryer, who was investigating a group of former cops engaged in illegal activities. Chin Ho and his former fiance reunite and marry, with the Five-0 task force and Kamekona as members of their wedding party.McGarrett continues to try to learn more about the death of his father and the mysterious Shelburne. His former SEAL Commander, Joe White (who was also a friend of McGarrett's father), arrives in the islands and appears to be helping McGarrett at times and getting in his way at others. Wo Fat returns and is involved in a series of murders, including the leader of the Yakuza, Hiro Noshimuri, and is being hunted down by them. At the end of the season, Joe takes McGarrett to see Shelburne in Japan; Shelburne turns out to be his mother, who was presumed dead for 20 years.[7]The idea to bring Hawaii Five-O back to television had been under consideration well before the 2010 version was announced. The first attempt was a one-hour pilot for a new series that was made in 1996 but never aired, although a few clips were found years later and are available online. Produced and written by Stephen J. Cannell, it was intended to star Gary Busey and Russell Wong as the new Five-0 team. Original cast member James MacArthur briefly returned as Dan Williams, this time as governor of Hawaii, with cameos made by other former Five-O regulars. Another attempt was made to turn the project into a film by Warner Bros. but that also was scrapped.[10]On August 12, 2008, CBS announced that it would bring Hawaii Five-O back to the network schedule for the 20092010 television season. The new version would be an updated present-day sequel, this time centering around Steve McGarrett, who succeeds his late father Steve (Jack Lord's character in the original series) as the head of the unit. Ed Bernero, executive producer and showrunner of Criminal Minds, was to helm the new take, which he described as "Hawaii Five-O, version 2.0". It was also to incorporate most of the iconic elements from the original, including the "Book 'em, Danno" catchphrase, into the remake. Bernero, who was a fan of the original, and had a ring tone of the series' theme song on his cell phone, had always wanted to bring the series back to TV.[11] This version did not go beyond the script stage.In October 2009, it was announced that Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci had signed on to script a pilot episode, and that Peter M. Lenkov would serve as the series showrunner.[12] Kurtzman and Orci decided to reboot the original concept similar to their work on the 2009 Star Trek film, rather than a sequel to the original series. Production on the pilot was shot in and around Honolulu from February to April 2010.On May 17, 2010, the Hawaii Five-O remake was picked up by CBS, which scheduled it for Monday nights in the 1011 pm timeslot.[13][14] The news was good for the state of Hawaii, which hopes that the remake will pump new life into the economy. Production of the remainder of the first season started in June 2010.[15][16] On June 24, 2010, the producers announced that it will use the warehouse at the former Honolulu Advertiser building as the official soundstage studio for the series starting in July 2010.[17] Exteriors representing Five-0 headquarters in the series are located at the Judiciary History Center of the Supreme Court Building in Honolulu, directly across the street from Iolani Palace, which represented Five-O headquarters in the original series.This revival series uses a zero as the last character in its title instead of the letter "O" that is used in the title of the original series. According to The Los Angeles Times, a CBS insider said that the disambiguation was necessary because of search engine results.[18] When Variety conducted its own search engine test on Google, it found that "Hawaii Five-0" (with the zero) had 263,000 results while "Hawaii Five-O" (with the letter O) had over 1.7 million.[19]On August 18, 2011, CBS announced that Hawaii Five-0 would cross over with NCIS: Los Angeles by having Daniela Ruah guest star as Kensi Blye from the latter series.[20] The crossover aired on October 24, 2011, in episode 6 of season 2. A two-part crossover was aired on the April 30, 2012 episode of Hawaii Five-0 and the May 1, 2012 episode of NCIS: Los Angeles, with two characters from each show visiting the other (Callen and Hanna from NCIS: Los Angeles and Danny and Chin Ho from Five-0).In February 2010, it was announced that Daniel Dae Kim had been cast to play Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-cop trained by Steve McGarrett's father. He was the first actor cast for the remake.[21] Several days later, Alex O'Loughlin was cast as Steve McGarrett,[22] the son of ex-cop John McGarrett (portrayed by William Sadler). The producers pay homage to the original series by making one of Steve's hobbies restoring his father's 1974 Mercury Marquis, which is in fact the actual car driven by Jack Lord in the latter half of the original series' run.[23] Actress Grace Park was later cast as rookie detective Kona "Kono" Kalakaua,[24] and Scott Caan was cast as Danny "Danno" Williams. In the recurring cast are Jean Smart as Governor Pat Jameson and Masi Oka as the medical examiner Max Bergman. Oka was upgraded to series regular for the second season.[25]Of note, several recurring roles have been filled by surviving members of the original cast. Al Harrington, who played Det. Ben Kokua in the original series, now plays a friend of McGarrett's, Mamo Kahike.[26] Dennis Chun, who had various guest roles in the original series and is the son of Kam Fong Chun (the actor that portrayed the original Chin Ho), has a recurring role as HPD Sgt. Duke Lukela in the remake.[27] James MacArthur, the last surviving main cast member from the original series, agreed to guest star in a first season episode; however, he died on October 28, 2010, before filming his appearance.[28]Larisa Oleynik was cast as Jessica Kaye[29] (changed to Jenna Kaye in the episode broadcast),[30] scheduled to join the Five-0 task force in the show's 19th episode.[31] Oleynik appeared on a recurring basis for the remainder of the 201011 season, with an option to become a regular in season 2;[32] however, her character was killed off in season 2, episode 10. It was also announced that Terry O'Quinn would be joining the cast of the show in season two,[33] along with Lauren German, who would play Lori Weston, a former Homeland Security (and FBI agent) official assigned by the new governor to keep an eye on the team.[34]For season three, Christine Lahti has been cast in a recurring role as Doris McGarrett, the thought-to-be-deceased mother of Steve McGarrett.[35] Also, Michelle Borth who plays Lt. Catherine Rollins will become main cast for season 3.Hawaii Five-0 uses the original show theme song composed by Morton Stevens. Critics received an early copy of the pilot with a synthesizer and guitar-based version of the theme. After negative reaction to the reworked song spread quickly online, Kurtzman said he and others realized that changing the music was a mistake, and arranged for studio musicians,[36] including three who had worked on the original from 1968,[37] to rerecord the theme "exactly as it was", except shortened to 30 seconds[36] from its original length of about 60 seconds.[38] Original instrumental music is composed by Brian Tyler and Keith Power.[39]Hawaii Five-0: Original Songs from the Television Series is a soundtrack album featuring music used in the CBS television series Hawaii Five-0. The first volume in the series received attention for how show producers integrated these new and previously unreleased tracks from major-name artists into the second season episodes. This method contrasted with the norm for TV soundtracks, which tend to be compilations of previously released music that is already available individually or on other albums. Hawaii Five-0: Original Songs from the Television Series was released on October 4, 2011, according to [1] Amazon.com.| "What Makes You Beautiful" || One Direction ||The series premiered in the U.S. on CBS on September 20, 2010. Canada's Global TV and NTV premiered the show at the same time as the United States premiere.[40] Hawaii Five-0 has been syndicated for broadcast in several countries worldwide, including Australia,[41] the United Kingdom,[42] France,[43] Germany,[44] Italy,[45][46] Japan,[47] Spain,[48] the Middle East,[49] the Netherlands,[50] and South Africa.[51]The show has received mostly positive reviews, scoring a 65 out of 100 aggregate score on Metacritic as of October 12, 2010.[2] On May 19, 2010, The Honolulu Advertiser offered an opinion about the new version: "A smart script, slick production values and maybe a splash of nostalgia got the remake of Hawaii Five-O placed on the CBS prime-time lineup this fall, but it will take more than beefcake and a remixed theme song to keep the show on the air." The piece also pointed out that times have changed since the original left the air, citing other shows that were set in Hawaii which have come and gone. It expressed a hope that the producers will succeed in bringing a new life to the title with this remake.[52] The show also has a large, hugely devoted fanbase, often called an "ohana". Hawaii Five-0 was also in the Guinness World Records 2012 for Highest-Rated New Show in the U.S. with a record 19.34 million viewers for its January 23, 2011 episode (Kai ee).[53]Series star Scott Caan was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Series, Miniseries or Television Film for his role as Danny on Hawaii Five-0. Hawaii Five-0 also won the "Favorite New TV Drama" at the 37th People's Choice Awards on January 5, 2011.Hawaii Five-0 made several positive effects on the state's economy since it began airing. Known as the "Five-0 Effect" by Hawaii News Now reporter Steve Uyehara, various Hawaii-based businesses saw an increase in sales after they were featured in episodes of the show. Visitor numbers to the USS Missouri Memorial Association, after being featured in some of the episodes, increased 25 percent, helping the site achieve a record year in 2010. Waiola Shave Ice, the business run by Kamekona on the show, saw a 20 percent increase in shave ice sales, along with a 30 percent rise in t-shirt sales. Kona Brewing Company also saw a 60 percent increase in sales after their beers were featured as McGarrett's favored alcoholic beverage in several episodes. In addition, residents from other states visit Hawaii based on viewing the series.[61]TNT has acquired the off network rights to air the series. Episodes will begin on the cable channel in 2014.[62]Hawaii Five-0 at TV.comPeter M.

"Steve" McGarrett, USNR, a former Navy SEAL with time spent in Office of Naval Intelligence. He is named after his grandfather, a USS Arizona casualty. McGarrett's father John is murdered in the pilot episode, and this forms the basis for the series' first story arc. (In Season 1 episode 4, "Lanakila", it was revealed that John McGarrett was born on March 15, 1942, and died September 20, 2010.) Steve McGarrett is both physically and intellectually capable, being able to speak Hawaiian and Chinese fluently while also being able to engage a person in hand to hand combat as well as utilizing fieldcraft when needed. McGarrett utilizes close quarters combat as his primary means of taking down suspects, something he was taught during SEAL training. He is an experienced Navy SEAL, as the governor once outlined his resume "Annapolis, five years Naval Intelligence, six years with the SEALs. Your superiors say that you are the best they have ever seen."Scott Caan as Detective Sergeant Daniel "Danny" (or "Danno") Williams, a Honolulu Police Department (HPD) detective, who transferred from the Newark Police Department when his ex-wife, Rachel, moved to Hawaii with their daughter Grace. Williams' "by-the-book" style contrasts with McGarrett's more impulsive "the ends justify the means" approach, and is a source of friction (and banter) between the two. Regarded as a haole for wearing a tie on the island during the first season, Williams is a loyal cop who is married to his job first and life second. As a consequence, he is often at odds with his ex-wife Rachel for sometimes not being on time. He is a loyal cop and friend, once refusing to believe that his former police partner was corrupt even when pitted against overwhelming evidence after the partner was found dead (season 1, episode 8).Daniel Dae Kim as Detective Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly, a former member of the HPD (reinstated in finale of season 1) and protg of McGarrett's father, who left the force after being falsely accused of corruption. It is later revealed that his uncle, a retired cop, took the money to pay for medical bills for his aunt. Despite insistence that he come clean, Kelly is willing to take the blame to prevent his uncle from going to jail. He is eventually cleared of the corruption charges and is reinstated to the HPD as a Lieutenant, but returns to the task force.Grace Park as Officer Kono Kalakaua, a recent HPD academy graduate and former professional surfer, who is also Chin Ho Kelly's cousin. She is detained and questioned by the HPD, having been accused of stealing $10 million from an HPD asset forfeiture locker. While on suspension, she helps Kelly and Williams go after Wo Fat, who was responsible for framing Steve McGarrett for the murder of the Governor. To the members of the Five-0 task force and to the general public, Kalakaua had been stripped of her badge by the Internal Affairs Department of the HPD, but it was later revealed to be a ploy for her to go undercover to bust a string of dirty ex-cops.Masi Oka as Dr. Max Bergman (Season 2present, season one recurring), an American-born Chief Medical Examiner. He also plays the piano and is a science fiction fan.Lauren German as Special Agent Lori Weston (Season 2 episodes 24 recurring, Season 2 episodes 516 main[8]), a former Homeland Security (and FBI) profiler assigned by the new governor to keep an eye on Five-0 to make sure they are following the rules.

He is later arrested by McGarrett in 2x22 - Ua Hopu.Larisa Oleynik as ex-CIA analyst Jenna Kaye, assistant to Five-0. She is later revealed to have an association with Wo Fat. At the end of an episode, she is seen driving Wo Fat away after he murdered Victor Hesse. She leaves to follow-up on a lead that her fianc, Josh whom she claimed had been killed by Wo Fat, might in fact be alive and asks Steve to go with her to North Korea to get him. It turns out to be a trap for McGarrett, from Wo Fat telling Jenna he'd release Josh if she brought him McGarrett, explaining her association with him. Jenna later discovers that Josh had been dead the entire time and that it was also a trap for her. She is able to tell McGarrett she's sorry for setting him up and gives him a pin to help him escape moments before Wo Fat shoots and kills her (season 2, episode 10).Taylor Wily as Kamekona, proprietor of Waiola Shave Ice and Kamekona's shrimp truck.

Modern Family is an American comedy which debuted on ABC on September 23, 2009. Presented in mockumentary style, the fictional characters frequently talk directly into the camera. It tells of Jay Pritchett, his second wife and step son, and his two children and their families. Lloyd and Levitan conceived the series while sharing stories of their own "modern families."The series premiered to critical acclaim and was watched by 12.6 million viewers.[1][2] Early on, it was named as a key contender for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[3] Soon after, on October 8, 2009, the series was picked up for a full season.[4][5] The series has received positive reviews from critics and received several award nominations. The series has won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in each of the past three years and the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series three times so far as well, twice for Eric Stonestreet and once for Ty Burrell, as well as the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series twice for Julie Bowen.[6][7] It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series Musical or Comedy.[8]The syndication rights to the show have also been sold to USA Network and 10 Fox affiliates for a fall 2013 premiere.[9][10][11] The success of the show has also led it to being the sixteenth-highest revenue-generating show for 2010, earning $1.6 million an episode.[12] Brian Lowry, of Variety, sums up the show in regards to the airing of the pilot episode: "Flitting among three storylines, it's smart, nimble and best of all, funny, while actually making a point about the evolving nature of what constitutes 'family'".[13]As Lloyd and Levitan retold stories about their families, it occurred to them that that could be the basis for a show. They started working on the idea of a family being observed in a mockumentary style show. They later decided it could be a show about three families and their experiences,[14] and originally called My American Family.[15] The creators pitched it to three of the four major networks. (They did not pitch it to Fox because of issues Lloyd had with the network over Back to You.)[16] CBS, not ready to use the single-camera style of filming nor ready to make another large commitment, rejected the series (Welcome to The Captain and Worst Week were single-camera sitcoms that recently aired on CBS but both lasted one season). NBC, already having two shows with a mockumentary format  The Office and Parks and Recreation  decided against accepting the show before the success of the other two series decreased. ABC accepted the series and picked it up for a full season.[16] Modern Family is an adaptation of a French TV show Fais pas ci, fais pas a of which ABC bought the rights in 2008.[17]The series quickly became a priority for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) after the pilot episode tested high with focus groups, resulting in the network ordering 16 episodes and adding it to the 20092010 fall lineup days ahead of ABC's official schedule announcement.[18][19][20] The series was given a full season pickup on October 8, 2009.[4][5] On January 12, 2010, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson announced that Modern Family had been renewed for a second season.[21] A third season was ordered by ABC on January 10, 2011.[22] The series was also picked up for syndication by USA during the first season for 1.5 million dollars and to 10 Fox affiliates during the second season.[9][10][11][23] The series airs in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland on Sky1.[24]Principal photography takes place in Los Angeles.[13] Creators Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan, whose credits both include Frasier, Wings, and Just Shoot Me,[15] are executive producers of the series, serving as showrunner and head writer under their Lloyd-Levitan Productions label in affiliation with Twentieth Century Fox Television.[13] The other producers on the writing team are Paul Corrigan, Sameer Gardezi, Joe Lawson, Dan O'Shannon, Brad Walsh, Caroline Williams, Bill Wrubel, Danny Zuker, and Jeff Morton.[13][25] The first team of directors included Jason Winer, Michael Spiller, Randall Einhorn, and Chris Koch. Winer has directed nineteen episodes of the series, making him the most prolific director of the series.[13][26]As a result of the show's success, the cast attempted in the summer of 2012 to renegotiate their existing contracts to obtain higher per-episode fees. However, talks broke down to the point where the first table read for the fourth season had to be postponed. Five of the cast members (Burrell, Bowen, Ferguson, Stonestreet and Vergara) retained the Quinn Emanuel law firm and sued 20th Century Fox Television in Los Angeles County Superior Court on July 24, 2012. While not part of the lawsuit, Ed O'Neill (who had been earning more per episode than the other five) joined his fellow castmates in seeking raises for each to about $200,000 per episode. Their complaint invoked the "seven-year rule" in California Labor Code Section 2855 (the De Havilland Law), and requested a declaration that their contracts were void because as drafted, the contracts were in violation of that rule.[27] Although the lawsuit is still pending, the performers returned for their first table read on July 26, 2012, with the understanding that the producers would resume contract negotiations in good faith.[28]Modern Family employs an ensemble cast. The show revolves around three families that are interrelated through Jay Prichett and his children, Claire and Mitchell. Jay Prichett (Ed O'Neill), the patriarch, is married to a much younger woman, Gloria (Sofa Vergara), a passionate[29] mother, who raises her son, Manny (Rico Rodriguez). Claire (Julie Bowen) is a homemaker mom married to Phil (Ty Burrell), a real estate agent and self-professed "cool dad". They have three children: Haley (Sarah Hyland) the stereotypical teenager,[30] Alex (Ariel Winter), the smart middle child[31] and Luke (Nolan Gould), the offbeat only son.[32] Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a lawyer, and his partner Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) have adopted a Vietnamese baby, Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons). In the first season, the adult cast was paid from a range of $30,000 per episode to about $90,000.[33]The series has also had several recurring characters. Reid Ewing appeared in several episodes as Haley's boyfriend, Dylan.[34] Fred Willard has guest starred as Phil's father, Frank Dunphy, and later went on to be nominated at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, but lost to Neil Patrick Harris's performance on Glee.[35] Shelley Long has appeared in both seasons as Claire and Mitchell's biological mother and Jay's ex-wife, DeDe Pritchett.[36][37] Nathan Lane appeared twice during the second season as Cameron and Mitchell's flamboyant friend, Pepper Saltzman.[38][39][40]Appearing in a few episodes is Jay and Gloria's dog Stella. Stella was played by Brigitte, but is now being played by Beatrice.[41]The characters in green have regular roles on the show. Dotted lines indicate a parental relationship through adoption or marriage, and dashed lines indicate a divorce between characters.The series premiered Wednesday, September 23, 2009 in the 9:00pm ET timeslot. Soon after, the series was picked up for a full season of 24 episodes on October 8, 2009.[4][5] On January 12, 2010, Modern Family was renewed for a second season by ABC.[42] The second season premiered September 22, 2010, airing in the same timeslot as the previous season.[43] Midway through the second season, the network renewed the series for a third season on January 10, 2011.[22] The third season premiered on September 21, 2011 with two back-to-back episodes,[44] beginning with a one-hour special. On May 10, 2012, Modern Family was renewed for a fourth season by the channel,[45][46] premiering on September 26, 2012.The first season was met with universal critical acclaim. It received a Metacritic score of 86 out of 100.[47] Entertainment Weekly gave it an A-, calling it "immediately recognizable as the best new sitcom of the fall".[48] In Time's review, the show was named "the funniest new family comedy of the year".[49] It has also been compared to the 1970s series Soap, in regards to the multiple family aspect. Some have made comparisons to The Office and Parks and Recreation, due to their mockumentary formats.[50] BuddyTV named the show the second best show in 2009, saying, "Every actor is fantastic, every family is interesting, and unlike many shows, there isn't a weak link".[51] Robert Canning of IGN gave the season a 8.9 saying it was "Great" and called it "Simply put, Modern Family was one of the best new comedies of the season." He also praised the ensemble cast and the characters calling them lovable.[52] According to Metacritic, the first season was the best reviewed new broadcast television series.[53]Modern Family's outstanding cast continues to impress, and even wobbly episodes reliably supply sharp observations and goofball charm.The second season received positive reviews much like the first season, despite being given criticism for a sophomore slump. Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the new season four stars out of four, saying, "Not since Frasier has a sitcom offered such an ideal blend of heart and smarts, or proven itself so effortlessly adept at so many comic variations, from subtle wordplay to big-laugh slapstick to everything in between."[55] Robert Bianco in a later review stated "as good as it was in its first year, is even better in its second" positively comparing the characters to the characters from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Cosby Show and Friends.[56] During the second season, Adweek named the show one of the 100 Most Influential TV Shows (98th chronologically).[57][58] Despite this, the season received criticism from some critics for a sophomore slump.[59][60] Eric Stonestreet, who received praise during the first season,[61] was criticized during the second season for being too over the top.[62][63] Alan Sepinwall called Cameron Tucker a "whiny, overly-sensitive diva".[62] On the other hand, Ty Burrell has received praise for his performance as Phil Dunphy through both seasons.[61][64][65]The third season received an overall mixed reception. Slant Magazine reviewer Peter Swanson wrote that while the first episode was "the type of wacky-location stunt that's usually reserved for the fifth or sixth season of a dying sitcom", the following episodes "have been better [...] but they're still uneven".[66] He also criticized the writers for relying too much on "stunt episodes and celebrity cameos, like David Cross".[66] He ultimately gave the season 3 out of 4 stars.[66] James Parker of The Atlantic said, at the beginning of the third season that "Modern Family is very, very funny, almost ruthlessly so ... [It's] a bit of a master class in pace and brevity ... The writing is Vorsprung durch Technik: hectically compressed but dramatically elegant, prodigal in its zingers and snorters but austere in its construction." He found it an exception to his dislike for sitcoms that eschew a laugh track.[67]In The New York Times, Bruce Feiler called attention to how the show depicts the increasing way communications technology shapes the way people perceive others, even family members. "[It] is surely the first family comedy that incorporates its own hashtag of simultaneous self-analysis directly into the storyline," he writes. "Mark Zuckerberg may be a greater influence on Modern Family than Norman Lear."[68]The show's writers and actors agree. "We used to talk about how cellphones killed the sitcom because no one ever goes to anyone's house anymore" for routine information, Abraham Higginbotham told Feiler. "We embrace technology so it's part of the story." Ty Burrell draws on Fran Lebowitz's observation that there is no institution other than media. "I had this little flash of Philand methat we are parsing our personality together externally from how people perceive us."[68]James Parker said that "The American family circa 2011 is, after all, an acutely self-conscious and self-interrogating unit: How does one 'parent'? Who does what, which 'role'? Is Dad sufficiently dad-like and Mom enough of a mom?" he writes. "Modern Family taps right into all this, the cameras that lurch through its three households producing the sensation of a wild and shaky experiment, recorded for purposes educational or scientific."[67]Modern Family drew criticism from the LGBT community for its portrayal of Cameron and Mitchell as not being physically affectionate with each other. The criticism spawned a Facebook campaign to demand Mitchell and Cameron be allowed to kiss. In response to the controversy, producers released a statement that a season two episode would address Mitchell's discomfort with public displays of affection. Executive producer Levitan has said that it was unfortunate that the issue had arisen, since the show's writers had always planned on such a scene "as part of the natural development of the show."[69] The episode "The Kiss" eventually aired with the kiss scene in the background which drew praise from multiple critics.[70][71]During the third season, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni argued that gay criticism of Cameron and Mitchell actually showed the progress gays have made toward social acceptance. "A decade ago," he writes, "[gays] would have balkedand balked loudlyat how frequently Cameron in particular tips into limp-wristed, high-voiced caricature." But now, "most gay people trust that the television audience knows we're a diverse tribe, not easily pigeonholed ... Modern Family endows us with a sort of comic banality. It's an odd kind of progress. But it's progress nonetheless."[72]Another notable criticism of Modern Family from various online news sources is that the show reinforces gender roles and sexist stereotypes. Michelle Haimoff of the Christian Science Monitor criticized the show for only casting the women as stay-at-home moms while the husbands on the show have very successful careers: "There is a difference between quirky, flawed characters and ones who are incapable of professional success. And when the latter is reliably female, it makes for sexist television. It also makes for unrealistic television."[73] Other authors reinforce this criticism by pointing out that stay-at-home mothers are no longer the norm in today's society.[74] According to the Department of Labor, 68.9% of married moms are working or looking for work. Thus, it's no surprise that the lack of representation for working moms sparked conversation on Twitter: "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon writer Ali Waller asked her Twitter followers, If Modern Family is so modern then why dont any of the women have jobs?[75]According to a CNET staffer, commenting on an episode: "The wife and daughter are unable to learn how to use the remote and must be taught by the father, while the son is 'good with electronics,' even though he is thought of as the stupidest member of the family."[76] In the episode "Game Changer," one of the wives on the show, Gloria, hides her skill at chess so that her husband will not be upset at losing: "On its own, this moment is at best a sappy quip about compromise in an often heavy-handed series, and at worst, it's a moment in a show with 9.3 million viewers, on a network owned by Disney, which explicitly validates girls and women subduing their intellect."[77]By contrast, Hanna Rosin has praised the show as one of several that have begun subverting the longtime American sitcom stereotype of bumbling fathers incapable of managing anything at home despite being the only one employed. "Phil Dunphy should be the house boob, with his embarrassing philosophy of 'peerenting,'" she wrote in Slate. "But Dunphy is not just comic relief; he's a successful salesman and the center of joy and fun in his household, especially compared to his uptight wife. No one really disdains him, and the domestic space belongs as much to him as to her."[78]In 2010, Modern Family was nominated with five Television Critics Association Awards. The show gained nominations for best new series, best comedy series and best program of the year, while Ty Burrell and Eric Stonestreet were nominated individually.[79] Like Friends, to reinforce the idea of an ensemble cast, the cast all submitted themselves in the Supporting Actor and Actress categories instead of Lead Actor and Actress for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[80] On August 29, 2010, Modern Family won Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series (for the pilot episode), and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (Eric Stonestreet). The show also later received a GLSEN Respect Award for its portrayal of "positive images and storylines that reflect a diverse America, including the depiction of a family headed by a gay couple."[81] In 2010, the cast won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy, beating the previous year's winner, Glee.[82] On July 14, 2011, the series received 17 Emmy nominations, the third most nominations for the year after Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire.[83] The awards the series was nominated for include Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actor for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.[83] The series has also been put on multiple critics' lists. In 2010, the series was listed on BuddyTV's Top Ten Best Comedy Shows of 20092010,[84] 2nd on Time's Top Ten Best shows of 2009,[85] 2nd on BuddyTV's Top Ten Best Shows of 2009,[86] Jason Hughes Best TV of 2009,[87] 10th on BuddyTV's Top 10 Returning Shows We're Most Excited to Come Back,[88] and on TV Guide's Our Favorite Families[89] Modern Family was awarded a Peabody Award in 2009.[90] In 2012, the show won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series  Musical or Comedy[8] and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award. In 2012, the show received a total of fourteen Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series, and nominations for all six of its adult actors in the Supporting Actor and Actress Comedy categories.Both Ann Romney (wife of US presidential candidate Mitt Romney) in an interview with The Insider and First Lady Michelle Obama in an interview with Kal Penn at the 2012 Democratic National Convention have cited Modern Family as their favorite TV show.Since its premiere, the series has remained popular. In its first season, the show became the sixth highest-rated scripted show in America among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, and the third-highest rated new show.[91] Aided by winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the show's second season became the highest rated show on Wednesday on premiere week[92] and also rose 34% from the previous season among adults between the ages of 18 and 49.[93] The show frequently ranked as television's top scripted series in adults 1849 as well.[94][95][96] The success of the show has been positively compared to The Cosby Show.[97] During the 20102011 season, Modern Family was the highest rated scripted show in the 1849 demographic, and the third highest rated overall sitcom behind CBS's The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men.[98][99] The season also ranked first among DVR viewers.[100] The third season premiere became ABC's top-rated season premiere in six years.[101] The series success in ratings has also led to the series being credited for reviving sitcoms.[102]Modern Family at TV.com1 Production

The Cannon Group Inc. was an American group of companies, including Cannon Films, which produced a distinctive line of low-to-medium budget films[2] from 1967 to 1993. The extensive group also owned, amongst others, a large international cinema chain and a video film company that invested heavily in the video market, buying the international video rights to several classic film libraries.Cannon Films was incorporated on October 23, 1967. It was formed by Dennis Friedland and Chris Dewey while they were in their early 20s. By 1970, they had produced films on a larger production scale than a lot of major distributors, such as Joe, starring Peter Boyle. They managed this by tightly limiting their budgets to $300,000 per pictureor less, in some cases. However, as the 1970s moved on, a string of unsuccessful movies seriously drained Cannons capital. This, along with changes to film-production tax laws, led to a drop in Cannon's stock price. 1978 saw the German release of the science-fiction musical The Apple under the title Star Rock. Other notable films co-produced by Friedland and Dewey included Blood on Satan's Claw and Michael Reeves' The Sorcerers.By 1979, Cannon had hit serious financial difficulties, and Friedland and Dewey sold Cannon to Israeli cousins Menahem Golan (who had directed The Apple) and Yoram Globus for $500,000.[3] The two cousins forged a business model of buying bottom-barrel scripts and putting them into production.They tapped into a ravenous market for action B-pictures in the 1980s.[4] Although they are most remembered for the Death Wish sequels and Chuck Norris action pictures such as The Delta Force and Invasion U.S.A., and even the vigilante thriller Exterminator 2 (the sequel to 1980s The Exterminator), Cannons output was actually far more varied, with musical and comedy films like Breakin, Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo, The Last American Virgin, and the U.S. release of The Apple; period romance pictures like Lady Chatterley's Lover (1981), Bolero, and Mata Hari (1985); science fiction and fantasy films like Hercules, Lifeforce and The Barbarians; as well as serious pictures like John Cassavetes Love Streams, Zeffirellis Otello (a film version of the Verdi opera), Norman Mailers Tough Guys Dont Dance, Andrei Konchalovskys Runaway Train, and Shy People; and action/adventure films such as the 3-D Treasure of the Four Crowns, King Solomons Mines, Cobra and American Ninja.One of Cannons biggest hits was the Vietnam action B-movie Missing in Action, with Chuck Norris.[5] The film, however, was criticized heavily as being a preemptive cash-in on the Rambo film series.[6][7] James Cameron's story treatment for Rambo: First Blood Part II was floating around Hollywood in 1983, by which Golan and Globus reviewed and were "inspired".[6][7] The writers of MIA even gave Cameron credit saying their film was inspired by his script treatment.[8] But Cannon had initially put the prequel Missing in Action 2: The Beginning into production. Only after the two movies were completed had the company realized that the planned second movie was superior to the first one. So, the first movie produced became an awkward prequel.[9]During these years, Cannon worked with entertainment-advertising company Design Projects, Inc. for most of the one-sheet posters, trade advertising, and large billboards prominently displayed at the Cannes Film Festival each year. Substantial pre-sales of the next years' films were made based on the strong salesmanship skills of Golan, Danny Dimbort, and the advertising created by Design Projects. The deposits made from these sales financed production of the first film in the production line-up, whichwhen completed and delivered to theatre owners around the worldgenerated enough money to make the next film in the line-up. Slavenberg Bank in the Netherlands provided bridge financing until the pre-sales amounts were collected.By 1986, when company earnings reached their apex with 43 films in one year, Cannon Films shares had soared a hundredfold. Golan remained Chairman of the Board, while Globus served as President.During this year, Cannon Films released Robotech: The Movie (also called Robotech: The Untold Story) for a limited run in Mesquite, Texas. (A suburb of Dallas.) Cannon was reportedly unsatisfied with Carl Maceks first version of the movie, which was almost a straight adaptation of the anime Megazone 23. It was at their insistence that footage from The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross (the series adapted as the Robotech Masters segment of the Robotech TV series) and Megazone 23 be spliced together to produce a more action-oriented movie. Macek recalls that although he was unhappy with this revised version, Menahem Golan, after viewing it, happily said: "Now thats a Cannon movie!"[citation needed] Nevertheless, Robotech: The Movie was unsuccessful in its brief Texas run and saw no further release. Carl Macek has gone on record as disowning it.[citation needed]Film critic Roger Ebert said of Golan-Globus in 1987, "no other production organization in the world todaycertainly not any of the seven Hollywood "majors"has taken more chances with serious, marginal films than Cannon."[10] That year, Cannon gained its greatest artistic success: its Dutch production The Assault won the 1986 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.Golan and Cannon Films were famous for making huge announcements and over-promoting movies that did not live up to expectationsor even exist. For instance, Lifeforce (1985) was to be "the cinematic sci-fi event of the '80s" and Masters of the Universe (1987) was dubbed "the Star Wars of the '80s."Additionally, Cannon owned the film rights to Spider-Man, and planned to make a Spider-Man movie in the mid-1980s.[11] Golan and Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of the films revenues.[11] The rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990.[12]By 1988, a cooling of the film market and a string of box office flops had drained Cannons capital. The multi-million dollar production of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), whose original $36-million budget was halved ($17 million) by Cannon, failed at the box office. Cannon signed an agreement with Warner Bros. to handle part of Cannons assets; however, the financial loss was staggering. Having purchased Thorn EMI's Screen Entertainment division in 1986,[13] Cannon Films was severely stretched, and faced bankruptcy. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation into Cannon's financial reports, suspecting that Cannon had fraudulently misstated them.On the verge of failure, Cannon Films was taken over by Path Communications, a holding company controlled by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti. Financed by the French bank Credit Lyonnais, Path Communications' takeover of Cannon immediately began a corporate restructuring and refinancing of $250 million to pay off Cannon debt. By 1989, Golan, citing differences with both Parretti and Globus, resigned from his position and left Cannon to start 21st Century Film Corporation, while Globus remained with Path.One of the final movies produced by the team of Golan and Globus that received a wide release under the Cannon Films banner was the Jean-Claude Van Damme post-apocalyptic action film Cyborg. This film was conceived to use both the costumes and sets built for an intended sequel to Masters of the Universe and the ill-fated live-action version of Spider-Man. Both projects were planned to shoot simultaneously under the direction of Albert Pyun. After Cannon Films had to cancel deals with both Mattel and Marvel Entertainment because of their financial troubles, they needed to recoup the money spent on both projects.As part of his severance package from Path, Golan took the rights to Marvels characters Spider-Man and Captain America. (Golan was able to put Captain America into production, and released it directly to video through his 21st Century Film Corporation.) Not to let that pre-production work go to waste, Pyun wrote Cyborg, with Chuck Norris in mind, suggesting it to Cannon Films. Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast in the lead role. Some television stations still give the films title as Masters of the Universe 2: Cyborg.Following Golan's departure from Cannon Films, he became the head of 21st Century Film Corporation. Globus continued working with Parretti at Path.When Path took over control of MGM/UA in 1990 as part of the MGM-Pathe merger, the Cannon Films library became part of the MGM library. During Parretti's tenure at MGM, he appointed Globus as president of the studio for a brief period of time.In 1990, Parretti reorganized Cannon Pictures, Inc. as the low-budget distribution arm of Path. Veteran Italian film producer Ovidio G. Assonitis served as Chairman and CEO of the new Cannon Pictures from 1990 to 1991. After the MGM-Pathe merger, Cannon Pictures spun off from Path, and was later run by former Cannon Group production head Christopher Pearce, who served as Chairman and CEO from 1991 to 1994. Cannon Pictures continued to release films, including A Man Called Sarge, American Ninja 4: The Annihilation and No Place to Hide.Parretti was pushed out of management control of MGM in 1991 by Credit Lyonnais, after he defaulted on loan payments.[14] Parretti was later convicted of perjury and evidence tampering in a Delaware court for statements he made in a 1991 civil case, brought by Credit Lyonnais to validate their removal of Parretti, to the effect that a document he claimed allowed him to retain control of MGM was authentic;[15][16] he fled the country for Italy before he could be sentenced or extradited to France, where he was wanted on criminal charges related to his use of MGM's French assets.[16][17] In 1997, the California Superior Court in Los Angeles entered a final judgement in a separate civil suit against Parretti, ordering him to pay $1.48 billion to Credit Lyonnais.[16] After Federal prosecuters unsealed an indictment against Parretti and Florio Fiorini accusing them of fraud in 1999, Italian authorities arrested both men and held them for extradition to the United States.[18] Parretti was released by the cort of appeal in Perugia shortly thereafter, ordered to remain in his home town of Orvieto and report to the police three times a week, even though authorities in Rome had requested he be held pending a decision on the extradition.[19]The 1988 Golan-Globus film Alien from L.A., starring model Kathy Ireland, was used as the basis of episode #516 of the movie-mocking television show Mystery Science Theater 3000. In 1993, Cannon Pictures released its last film Street Knight before it closed down. Yoram Globus and Christopher Pearce later joined 21st Century Film Corporation until 1996.Golan is still producing and directing films. Globus is the president of Globus Max, which has interests in film production and distribution and runs a 140-screen cinema chain in Israel.[citation needed]In late 2011 it was revealed that Australian director Mark Hartley is working on a documentary about Cannon Films called Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films.[20]The Cannon Group's first films in the United States were distributed independently and released on home video, initially through MCA Videocassette, Inc. and later on the small Paragon Video label. Cannon then made a deal with MGM, and their movies were distributed for home video (and later some films theatrically) by MGM, appearing in the gray MGM Video "big boxes".Later, Golan and Globus had a falling out with MGM, supposedly over the erotic unrated film Bolero with Bo Derek, which ended up being released under the U.S.A. Home Video label. Their movies were then released on home video for a short time by Media Home Entertainment, with some of the larger films, like Masters of the Universe and Over the Top, distributed by either or Warner Bros. or TriStar Pictures. When Cannon merged with Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment, they inherited EMI's home video label, which was then a partnership with HBO; however, they soon withdrew from the partnership to start their own video label with underwriting from WB, which lasted into the 1990s.Today, the worldwide theatrical and home-video rights (as well as international TV rights) to the majority of Cannon's library are owned by MGM, with the following exceptions:In all cases except worldwide television rights to Lifeforce, Trifecta Entertainment & Media handles the United States television rights to the Cannon pictures produced by Golan and Globus from 1979 onward; these rights were previously owned by Viacom Enterprises, Paramount Domestic Television, CBS Paramount Domestic Television, and CBS Television Distribution. CTD and its ancestor companies owned the TV rights to Superman IV until 2006, after which Warner Bros. Television took over the rights for three years, which went in 2009 to Paramount through television licensee Trifecta. Paramount Pictures owns the rights to distribute the Cannon library (except Lifeforce) on digital platforms. MGM retains television and digital platform rights to earlier Cannon films released before the company's purchase by Golan and Globus in 1979, such as Joe.1 History

Wyle was the only major cast member of ER to have been with the show since its inception (1994) when he left after its eleventh season (2005). His performances on the show earned him Emmy Award nominations in each of its first five seasons. As part of an ensemble he was nominated several times for the Screen Actors Guild Award, he was recognized with three Golden Globe nominations as Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television and won the 2001 TV Guide Award for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Wyle left the series at the end of the eleventh season, although he returned in guest appearances for a four-episode arc during the twelfth season. He stated that he left because he wanted to spend more time with his family and friends and to make room for the upcoming generation.[citation needed] However, in 2009, Wyle returned to ER during its fifteenth and final season for five episodes, including the series finale. According to the Guinness World Records 2005 Special 50th Anniversary Edition, Wyle became the holder of a "Highest paid TV drama actor per episode" record during the 2003-2004 tenth season, earning approximately $400,000 per episode. While on ER, Wyle's estimated salary was $9 million a year[citation needed]. Wyle has also appeared in the most episodes of ER, 255, four more than Laura Innes.*[6]Along with his film and television career, Wyle has also appeared on stage appearing in a 1995 Los Angeles stage production of The 24th Day with Peter Berg. With The Blank Theatre Company, he performed in The Who, and more recently in Lobster Alice, with Nicholas Brendon, where he played the surrealist painter Salvador Dal.

The two-hour premiere of Falling Skies was watched by 5.9 million viewers, making it cable television's biggest series launch of the year, with more than 2.6 million adults 1849 and 3.2 million adults 2554.[9] The series was renewed on July 7, 2011, for a second season of 10 episodes scheduled to air in summer 2012.[10]The first season of Falling Skies tied with the FX series American Horror Story as the biggest new cable series of the year among adults 18-49.[11]BuddyTV ranked him #91 on its list of "TV's Sexiest Men of 2011".[12]Wyle dated several women, including actress Samantha Mathis. While filming The Myth of Fingerprints in 1996, he met make-up artist Tracy Warbin. After proposing to her on Valentine's Day in 1999, they married on May 6, 2000. Together, they have a son, Owen Strausser Speer Wyle (born November 9, 2002), and a daughter, Auden Wyle (born October 15, 2005). Warbin's pregnancy with Auden was announced on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.Wyle bought Bo Derek's ranch in Santa Ynez Valley, California, in June 1999, for approximately $2.5 million. They listed their Los Feliz (Los Angeles) home at close to $4.4 million. The traditional-style house was designed by architect Paul Williams, was built in 1934 and has a theater, a detached guest house-office and a landscaped yard with city views, a pool, a koi pond, a patio and a fire pit.Wyle and Warbin, his wife of almost ten years, separated in late October 2009, according to People magazine. The couple live in separate residences, and both see their two children daily.[13]In 1999, Wyle made an appearance during the beginning of Steve Jobs's Macworld Expo keynote presentation, initially pretending to be Jobs. When the audience caught on, Jobs himself appeared and began to banter with Wyle.[14][15] It was a practical joke by Jobs and Wyle in light of the movie Pirates of Silicon Valley.Wyle devotes much of his free time to the international non-profit organization Doctors of the World and to his work as a member of the Human Rights Watch Council. Wyle also serves as the voluntary artistic producer of the Blank Theatre Company in Hollywood, which stages annual young playwrights festival and whose alumni include Ed Asner, Sarah Michelle Gellar, D. B. Sweeney, James Kerwin, Amber Benson, Megan Henning, Travis Schuldt, Warren Davis, Grant Show, and Nicholas Brendon. He also recently acquired Second Stage Theater (Los Angeles) in Hollywood, where the company has mounted numerous successful productions.Wyle was the spokesperson for The Cover the Uninsured campaign in 2004, which had as Honorary Co-Chairs former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter. The Cover the Uninsured Week is annually held in the United States of America and focuses attention on the nearly 44 million Americans who go without health care coverage. The campaign includes several events among different communities, health and enrollment fairs, press conferences and business seminars all over the U.S. Additionally, Wyle is also a vegetarian and a supporter of animal rights, having started a farm intended as sanctuary for abused and rescued animals. Wyle has also become a spokesman for the World Wildlife Fund, dedicated to protecting and conserving wildlife for future generations.[16]In 2009, Wyle became a spokesperson for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), claiming that polar bears are "hanging on by a thread" and "may be extinct in our children's lifetime, due to the effects of climate change."[17]In 2012, Wyle did work to support the disability rights group ADAPT.[18] On April 23, he was arrested during a protest in Capitol Hill to fight against Medicaid-cuts for the elderly and people with disabilities.[19]1 Early life2 Education3 Career

Numb3rs (/nmbrz/; stylized NUMB3RS) is an American crime drama television series that ran on CBS from January 23, 2005 to March 12, 2010. The series was created by Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, and follows FBI special agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) and his mathematical genius brother Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) who helps Don solve crimes for the FBI. Brothers Ridley and Tony Scott produced Numb3rs; its production companies are the Scott brothers' Scott Free Productions, CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Television, and later CBS Paramount Television).The show focuses equally on the relationships among Don Eppes, his brother Charlie Eppes, and their father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime, normally in Los Angeles. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by a team of FBI agents led by Don and mathematically modeled by Charlie, with the help of Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol) and Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat). The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics were always in some way crucial to solving the crime.The series was the most popular show airing on Friday evenings throughout its first four seasons.[1] In May 2010, CBS announced that Numb3rs had been cancelled after six seasons.[2]The show revolved around three intersecting groups of characters: the FBI, scientists at the fictitious California Institute of Science (CalSci), and the Eppes family.Temporary characters on the show were often named after famous mathematicians. For example, in the episode "In Plain Sight" (season 2, episode 8), one of the criminals is named Rolle and Charlie's father mentions a meeting with a man named Robert Peterson.Opening: (Narrated by David Krumholtz) We all use math every day. To predict weatherto tell timeto handle money. Math is more than formulas and equations. Its logic; its rationality. Its using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.The first season run of the show aired between January 23, 2005, and May 13, 2005, at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays. It sees the start of the working relationship between Los Angeles' FBI department and Charlie Eppes. The main FBI agents are Charlie's brother, Don Eppes, and Terry Lake, as well as David Sinclair. Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes, provides emotional support for the pair, while Professor Larry Fleinhardt and doctoral student Amita Ramanujan provide mathematical support and insights to Charlie. Season One was a half-season, producing only 13 episodes. Sabrina Lloyd played Terry Lake, an agent in this season; she was later replaced by Diane Farr, who played Megan Reeves.The second season run of the show aired between September 23, 2005, and May 19, 2006, again at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays. Season Two sees several changes to Don's FBI team: Terry Lake is reassigned to Washington and two new members join Don and David Sinclair: Megan Reeves and Colby Granger. Charlie is challenged on one of his long-standing pieces of mathematical work and also starts work on a new theory, Cognitive Emergence Theory. Larry sells his home and assumes a nomadic lifestyle, while he becomes romantically involved with Megan. Amita receives an offer for an assistant professor position at Harvard University, but is plagued by doubt as her relationship with Charlie is challenged and her career is in upheaval. Alan begins work and dating again, although he struggles with the loss of his wife, and both he and Charlie dream of her.Numb3rs was renewed for a third season,[3] which began airing in North America and Canada at 10:00 p.m. on Friday September 22, 2006, and ended on May 18, 2007. Charlie and Amita intensify their relationship, as do Larry and Megan, especially after Megan's kidnapping. Amita has troubles adjusting in her new role as a CalSci professor, and Larry announces his leave of absence  he will be on the International Space Station for six months, which greatly distresses Charlie. Charlie and his colleagues are troubled by Dr. Mildred Finch, the newly appointed Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, whom they learn has begun dating Alan. Meanwhile, Don dates Agent Liz Warner and questions his ethics and self-worth, and receives counseling. Charlie sees Don's therapist and the two understand one another more. Despite Don's concerns, Alan engages in some FBI consulting with his knowledge of engineering, and Larry returns from the space station, disillusioned. The finale wraps up with a revelation that Colby was actually a double agent for the Chinese.Noticeable changes from previous seasons include the removal of the opening credit sequence (credits are now done during the first segment of the show), the absence of Peter MacNicol's character for much of the season, and the absence of Diane Farr's character for a few episodes. Peter MacNicol appeared in the first eleven episodes before leaving for the television show 24, but returned to Numb3rs for the 21st episode of season 3 ("The Art of Reckoning"). His character's absence was written into the show by having him become a Payload Specialist on the International Space Station. Diane Farr, pregnant for most of the season, left the show for maternity leave in episode 18 ("Democracy"); her character's absence is explained as a special assignment to the Department of Justice.The season premiere aired on September 28, 2007, in the same time slot as in previous seasons, 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time.[4] Because of the writer's strike, only 12 episodes were initially produced. However, once the strike ended, CBS announced the show's return April 4, 2008, with six episodes.[5] The season ended on May 16, 2008.As this season starts, Colby Granger escapes from jail, and is revealed to be a triple agent. He then rejoins the team. Don and Liz break up halfway through this season, after Liz has trouble with Don's trust issues. Amita's parents come to visit, which becomes a secondary theme throughout most of the season. Due to her work at the D.O.J., Megan is conflicted by her work, and turns to Larry for help. Near the end of the season, Don's girlfriend from season 2, Robin Brooks, returns. Don and Robin then continue their relationship. Charlie attends FBI training camp because he has been working with Don for several years and wants to better understand what his brother does. In the season finale, Megan leaves the team to move back to Washington, D.C., and Charlie goes head-to-head with Don about a case. This causes Charlie to send information to scientists in Pakistan. He is subsequently arrested and has his security clearance revoked, so he can no longer help Don on cases. At the end of the episode, Don drives away to another case and Charlie admits that giving up FBI work will be harder than he expected.Several characters from previous seasons did not return in season 4. These characters include Mildred Finch and Ian Edgerton (though Edgerton appears in Seasons Five & Six).The fifth season premiered on October 3, 2008, and the season finale aired on May 15, 2009. The season premiere was moved back one week to accommodate the 2008 presidential debates.[6]Season five opens three weeks after "When Worlds Collide" (season four's season finale), with the government dropping the charges against Charlie. Charlie gets his security clearance back after he and Don fight FBI Security Officer Carl McGowan. Don begins to explore Judaism. The team adds new agent Nikki Betancourt, who arrives shortly after Megan Reeves' departure. Liz is offered a promotion but turns it down. Buck Winters (from the episodes, "Spree" and "Two Daughters") breaks out of prison and comes after Don. Alan suddenly finds himself coaching CalSci's basketball team. David becomes Don's primary relief supervisor. DARPA tries to recruit Charlie, but he turns down their offer. Toward the end of the season, Don is stabbed, and Charlie blames himself for it. The aftermath of Don's stabbing causes Charlie to focus more on his FBI consultation work. Amita is kidnapped, and the team races to find her. After she is rescued, Charlie proposes to Amita. Her response is unknown.Notes about Season Five: "Disturbed" marked the 100th episode of Numb3rs.[7]The sixth season premiered Friday September 25, 2009, at 10:00 p.m. EDT[8] and the season finale aired on March 12, 2010. The season starts with the engagement of Charlie and Amita. Soon after, Larry turns down an opportunity to meet with mathematicians at CERN, in Geneva, and drops his course load for the following semester. This leads Charlie to realize Larry is once again leaving, and leaving all of his work to Charlie. Don learns that his former mentor is crooked, causing Don angst when he has to shoot his mentor. Charlie and Don learn that Alan has lost a substantial amount of money in his 401(k). After some delay, Larry leaves Los Angeles, only to find a vacant piece of land for sale within driving distance of the city. Alan decides to return to work and finds a job as a software technical consultant. David asks Don for advice about career paths within the FBI. Larry returns from the desert with a new theory about the universe's fate. Charlie and Amita begin planning their wedding and decide to join the Big Brother/Big Sister program to practice parenting skills. They get married before their move to England to teach at the University of Cambridge. Don loses his gun, recovers it after it is used in some vigilante murders, and gets engaged. Before leaving, Charlie and Amita decide that the family garage should be converted to a guest house so Alan can continue living with them. Leaving Colby, Liz, and Nikki behind, David departs for Washington, D.C., to take a position as an anti-corruption team leader.CBS DVD (Distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment) has released all 6 seasons of Numb3rs on DVD in Region 1. The first five seasons have been released in Regions 2 & 4.Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, have won several awards for the show, including the Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science in 2006,[31] and the National Science Board's Public Service Award in 2007.[32] Also, the show's stunt coordinator, Jim Vickers, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination in 2006 for episode 14 of Season 2, "Harvest".[33]Several mathematicians work as consultants for each episode.[34][35][36] Actual mathematics is presented in the show; the equations on the chalkboards are mathematically valid, and are somewhat applicable to the situations presented in each show. This mathematical validity and applicability of the equations has been asserted by professional mathematicians.[34][37][38]However, "getting the math right and getting it to fit with the plot are not priorities for the NUMB3RS team", according to creator Cheryl Heuton.[39]A book entitled The Numbers Behind Numb3rs: Solving Crime with Mathematics (ISBN 0452288576; published August 28, 2007) has been written by Keith Devlin and Dr. Gary Lorden, a consultant to the show, explaining some of the mathematical techniques that have been used both in actual FBI cases and in other law enforcement departments.[40][41]Since the premiere season, the blog[42] edited by Prof. Mark Bridger (Northeastern University) has explained the mathematics behind each episode of the show.In Denmark, a blog[43] on the mathematics in Numb3rs was established when the show premiered there. It is run by Assoc. Prof Lisbeth Fajstrup and is written in Danish.Wolfram Research (the developers of Mathematica) is the chief math consultant, reviewing scripts and providing background mathematics for the show. Starting with season four, their website in collaboration with CBS is entitled "The math behind NUMB3RS".[44]At least one mathematician consultant to the show has expressed concern with its use of mathematics, which is inserted after the script and written to provide plausible sounding jargon, rather than having consultants involved at all stages of story development.[39] Other criticisms include the show's portrayal of female mathematicians and inappropriate aspects of the relationship between Charlie Eppes and his graduate student Amita Ramanujan.[39]The idea of Numb3rs was generated in the late 1990s when Nick Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, attended a lecture given by Bill Nye, a popular science educator.[45] The premise of the show is similar to that of author Colin Bruce's reimaginings of the Sherlock Holmes character,[46] and to the "Mathnet" segment on the children's television show Square One.Gabriel Macht was originally cast to portray the character of Don Eppes[citation needed]. Also, the original concept for the show had the events take place at Massachusetts Institute of Technology;[47] this was later changed to the fictional California Institute of Science, commonly called CalSci. Scenes which take place at CalSci are filmed at California Institute of Technology (Caltech)[47] and the University of Southern California. One of the most frequent campus locations at Caltech is the vicinity of Millikan Library, including the bridge over Millikan Pond, the Trustees room, and the arcades of nearby buildings. At USC, locations include Doheny Library and the Town and Gown dining room. Exteriors for the FBI offices are on the distinctive bridge at Los Angeles Center Studios.[48]Another common location is the Craftsman home of the Eppes family. The house shown in the first season is real; it is owned by David Raposa and Edward Trosper,[49] although a replica set was used from the second season onwards.[50]Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of Numb3rs on CBS.[51]Note: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.Numb3rs at TV.com1 Cast and characters2 Episodes

House (also known as House, M.D.) is an American television medical drama that originally ran on the Fox network for eight seasons from November 16, 2004, to May 21, 2012. The show's main character is Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), a drug-addicted, unconventional, misanthropic medical genius who leads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional PrincetonPlainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The shows premise originated with Paul Attanasio, while David Shore, who is credited as creator, was primarily responsible for the conception of the title character. The shows executive producers include Shore, Attanasio, Attanasios business partner Katie Jacobs, and film director Bryan Singer. It was largely filmed in Century City.House often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patients illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights. His flouting of hospital rules and procedures frequently leads him into conflict with his boss, hospital administrator and Dean of Medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). Houses only true friend is Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), head of the Department of Oncology. During the first three seasons, Houses diagnostic team consists of Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). At the end of the third season, this team disbands. Rejoined by Foreman, House gradually selects three new team members: Dr. Remy Thirteen Hadley (Olivia Wilde), Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), and Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn). Kutner makes his final appearance late in season five. Chase and Cameron continue to appear in different roles at the hospital until early in season six. Cameron then departs the hospital, and Chase returns to the diagnostic team. Thirteen takes a leave of absence for most of season seven, and her position is filled by medical student Martha M. Masters (Amber Tamblyn). Cuddy and Masters depart before season eight; Foreman becomes the new dean of medicine, while Dr. Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) and Dr. Chi Park (Charlyne Yi) join Houses team.Critically acclaimed for the first half of its run, House was among the top-ten rated shows in the United States from its second through its fourth season. Distributed to 66 countries, House was the most watched television program in the world in 2008.[1] The show received numerous awards, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Peabody Award, and nine People's Choice Awards. On February 8, 2012, Fox announced that the eighth season, then in progress, would be Houses last.[2] The series finale aired on May 21, 2012, following an hour-long retrospective.In 2004, David Shore and Paul Attanasio, along with Attanasio's business partner Katie Jacobs, pitched the show (untitled at the time) to Fox as a CSI-style medical detective program,[3] a hospital whodunit in which the doctors investigated symptoms and their causes.[4] Attanasio was inspired to develop a medical procedural drama by The New York Times Magazine column "Diagnosis", written by physician Lisa Sanders, who is an attending physician at Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH), and Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) is modeled after this teaching institution.[5] Fox bought the series, though the network's then-president, Gail Berman, told the creative team, "I want a medical show, but I don't want to see white coats going down the hallway".[6] Jacobs has said that this stipulation was one of the many influences that led to the show's ultimate form.[6]We knew the network was looking for procedurals, and Paul [Attanasio] came up with this medical idea that was like a cop procedural. The suspects were the germs. I mean, germs don't have motives.After Fox picked up the show, it acquired the working title Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain[8] ("zebra" is medical slang for an unusual or obscure diagnosis, while "circling the drain" refers to terminal cases, patients in an irreversible decline).[9] The original premise of the show was of a team of doctors working together trying to "diagnose the undiagnosable".[10] Shore felt it was important to have an interesting central character, one who could examine patients' personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies.[10] As Shore and the rest of the creative team explored the character's possibilities, the program concept became less of a procedural and more focused upon the lead role.[11] The character was named "House", which was adopted as the show's title as well.[8] Shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the pilot episode.[3] Bryan Singer, who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles, has said that the "title of the pilot was 'Everybody Lies', and that's the premise of the show".[11] Shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of Berton Rouech, a staff writer for The New Yorker between 1944 and 1994, who specialized in features about unusual medical cases.[4]Shore traced the concept for the title character to his experience as a patient at a teaching hospital.[12] Shore recalled: "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [for my cluelessness] and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room."[13] A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way.[14] The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox rejected this. Jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network's insistence that the character be reimaginedputting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension.[11] The writers ultimately chose to give House a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis, which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency.[14]Similarities between Gregory House and the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle appear throughout the series.[15][16] Shore explained that he was always a Holmes fan and found the character's indifference to his clients unique.[13] The resemblance is evident in House's reliance on deductive reasoning[15] and psychology, even where it might not seem obviously applicable,[9] and his reluctance to accept cases he finds uninteresting.[17] His investigatory method is to eliminate diagnoses logically as they are proved impossible; Holmes used a similar method.[8] Both characters play instruments (House plays the piano, the guitar, and the harmonica; Holmes, the violin) and take drugs (House is addicted to Vicodin; Holmes uses cocaine recreationally).[15] House's relationship with Dr. James Wilson echoes that between Holmes and his confidant, Dr. John Watson.[8] Robert Sean Leonard, who portrays Wilson, said that House and his characterwhose name is very similar to Watson'swere originally intended to work together much as Holmes and Watson do; in his view, House's diagnostic team has assumed that aspect of the Watson role.[18] Shore said that House's name itself is meant as "a subtle homage" to Holmes.[8][19] House's building number is 221B, a direct reference to Holmes's street address.[9]Individual episodes of the series contain additional references to the Sherlock Holmes tales. The main patient in the pilot episode is named Rebecca Adler after Irene Adler, a character in the first Holmes short story, "A Scandal in Bohemia".[20] In the season two finale, House is shot by a crazed gunman credited as "Moriarty," the name of Holmes's nemesis.[21] In the season four episode "It's a Wonderful Lie," House receives a "second edition Conan Doyle" as a Christmas gift.[22] In the season five episode "The Itch," House is seen picking up his keys and Vicodin from the top of a copy of Conan Doyle's The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes.[23] In another season five episode, "Joy to the World," House, in an attempt to fool his team, uses a book by Joseph Bell, Conan Doyle's inspiration for Sherlock Holmes.[8] The volume had been given to him the previous Christmas by Wilson, who included the message "Greg, made me think of you." Before acknowledging that he gave the book to House, Wilson tells two of the team members that its source was a patient, Irene Adler.[24] The series finale pays homage to Holmes's apparent death in "The Final Problem", the 1893 story with which Conan Doyle originally intended to conclude the Holmes chronicles.[25]House is a co-production of Heel and Toe Films, Shore Z Productions, and Bad Hat Harry Productions in association with Universal Media Studios for Fox.[27] Paul Attanasio and Katie Jacobs, the heads of Heel and Toe Films; David Shore, the head of Shore Z Productions; and Bryan Singer, the head of Bad Hat Harry Productions, have been executive producers of the program since its inception.[12] Lawrence Kaplow, Peter Blake, and Thomas L. Moran joined the staff as writers at the beginning of the first season after the making of the pilot episode. Writers Doris Egan, Sara Hess, Russel Friend, and Garrett Lerner joined the team at the start of season two. Friend and Lerner, who are business partners, had been offered positions when the series launched, but turned the opportunity down. After observing the show's success, they accepted when Jacobs offered them jobs again the following year.[28] Writers Eli Attie and Sean Whitesell joined the show at the start of season four. Since the beginning of season four, Moran, Friend, and Lerner have been credited as executive producers on the series, joining Attanasio, Jacobs, Shore, and Singer.[27] Hugh Laurie was credited as an executive producer for the second[29] and third[30] episodes of season five.Shore is House's showrunner.[31] Through the end of the sixth season, more than two dozen writers have contributed to the program. The most prolific have been Kaplow (18 episodes), Blake (17), Shore (16), Friend (16), Lerner (16), Moran (14), and Egan (13). The show's most prolific directors through its first six seasons were Deran Sarafian (22 episodes), who was not involved in season six, and Greg Yaitanes (17). Of the more than three dozen other directors who have worked on the series, only David Straiton directed as many as 10 episodes through the sixth season. Hugh Laurie directed the seventeenth episode of season six, "Lockdown".[32] Elan Soltes has been the visual effects supervisor since the show began.[33] Lisa Sanders, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, is a technical advisor to the series. She writes the "Diagnosis" column that inspired House's premise.[34] According to Shore, "three different doctors... check everything we do".[35] Bobbin Bergstrom, a registered nurse, is the program's on-set medical adviser.[35]It wasn't a massive move when I first considered [doing House]. What usually happens is you do a pilot and of the very few picked up, only about a quarter go to a second year. So I thought I'll have three fun weeks. I never dreamed I'd be here three and a half years later.At first, the producers were looking for a "quintessentially American person" to play the role of House.[37] Bryan Singer in particular felt there was no way he was going to hire a non-American actor for the role.[10] At the time of the casting session, actor Hugh Laurie was in Namibia filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix. He assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light,[37] and apologized for its appearance[38] (which Singer compared to a "bin Laden video").[39] Laurie improvised, using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the "American actor" was able to grasp the character.[10][40] Singer was not aware that Laurie was English, due to his convincing American accent. Laurie credits the accent to "a misspent youth [watching] too much TV and too many movies".[37] Although locally better-known actors such as Denis Leary, David Cross, Rob Morrow, and Patrick Dempsey were considered for the part, Shore, Jacobs, and Attanasio were as impressed as Singer and cast Laurie as House.[41]Laurie later revealed that he initially thought the show's central character was Dr. James Wilson. He assumed that House was a supporting part, due to the nature of the character, until he received the full script of the pilot episode.[42] Laurie, the son of a doctor, Ran Laurie, said he felt guilty for "being paid more to become a fake version of [his] own father".[37] From the start of season three, he was being paid $275,000 to $300,000 per episode, as much as three times what he had previously been making on the series.[43][44] By the show's fifth season, Laurie was earning around $400,000 per episode, making him one of the highest paid actors on network television.[45]Robert Sean Leonard had received the script for the CBS show Numb3rs, as well as that for House.[46] Leonard thought the Numb3rs script was "kind of cool" and planned to audition for the show.[46] However, he decided that the character he was up for, Charlie Eppes, was in too many scenes; he later observed, "The less I work, the happier I am".[46] He believed that his House audition was not particularly good, but that his lengthy friendship with Singer helped win him the part of Dr. Wilson.[46] Singer had enjoyed Lisa Edelstein's portrayal of a prostitute on The West Wing, and sent her a copy of the pilot script.[47] Edelstein was attracted to the quality of the writing and her character's "snappy dialogue" with House, and was cast as Dr. Lisa Cuddy.[47]Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent suggested that he audition for the role of Dr. Robert Chase. Spencer believed the program would be similar in style to General Hospital, but changed his mind after reading the scripts.[48] After he was cast, he persuaded the producers to turn the character into an Australian.[49] Patrick Dempsey also auditioned for the part of Chase; he later became known for his portrayal of Dr. Derek Shepherd on Grey's Anatomy.[50] Omar Epps, who plays Dr. Eric Foreman, was inspired by his earlier portrayal of a troubled intern on the NBC medical drama ER.[51] Jennifer Morrison felt that her audition for the part of Dr. Allison Cameron was a complete disaster.[52] However, before her audition, Singer had watched some of her performances, including on Dawson's Creek, and already wanted to cast her in the role.[52] Morrison left the show when her character was written out in the middle of season six.[53]At the end of season three, House dismisses Chase, while Foreman and Cameron resign.[54] House must then recruit a new diagnostic team, for which he identifies seven finalists. The producers originally planned to recruit two new full-time actors, with Foreman, who returns in season four's fifth episode, bringing the team back up to three members; ultimately, the decision was made to add three new regular cast members.[55] (Along with Epps, actors Morrison and Spencer remained in the cast, as their characters moved on to new assignments.) During production, the show's writers dismissed a single candidate per episode; as a result, said Jacobs, neither the producers nor the cast knew who was going to be hired until the last minute.[56] In the season's ninth episode, House's new team is revealed: Foreman is joined by doctors Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn),[57] Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson),[58] and Remy "Thirteen" Hadley (Olivia Wilde).[59] The candidates rejected by House have not returned to the show, with the exception of the last one cut: Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek), who appeared for the rest of season four as Wilson's girlfriend,[60] and in season five as a hallucination of House's.[61] While Penn and Wilde had higher profiles than the actors who played the other finalists, Jacobs said they went through an identical audition process and stayed with the show based on the writers' interest in their characters.[56] Kutner was written out of the series near the end of season five after Penn took a position in the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs.[62]The contracts of Edelstein, Epps, and Leonard expired at the end of season seven. As a cost-cutting measure, the three actors were asked to accept reduced salaries. Epps and Leonard came to terms with the producers, but Edelstein did not, and in May 2011 it was announced that she would not be returning for the show's eighth season.[63]House is often filmed using the "walk and talk" filming technique,[6][17] popularized on television by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, Sports Night, and The West Wing.[64] The technique involves the use of tracking shots, showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking.[64] Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because "when you put a scene on the move, it's a... way of creating an urgency and an intensity".[6] She noted the significance of "the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6'2" and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop".[6] Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker described the show's "cool, 'Fantastic Voyage'like special effects of patients' innards. I'll bet you didn't know that when your kidneys shut down they sound like bubble wrap popping."[65] "Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat" of one patient, another critic observed, "but up her nose and inside her brain and leg".[66] Instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery, the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography.[33] Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise, revealing aspects of his character and the story.[6]The pilot episode was filmed in Canada; primary photography for all subsequent episodes has been shot on the Fox lot in Century City.[35] Bryan Singer chose the hospital near his hometown, West Windsor, New Jersey, as the show's fictional setting.[12] Princeton University's Frist Campus Center[a] is the source of the aerial views of PrincetonPlainsboro Teaching Hospital seen in the series.[67] Some filming took place at the University of Southern California for the season three episode "Half-Wit", which guest-starred Dave Matthews and Kurtwood Smith.[68] Part of House's sixth season was filmed at the abandoned Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital, in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, as the fictional Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital.[69]The opening sequence begins with an MRI of a head with an image of the boxed "H" from the logo (the international symbol for hospital) in the foreground. This is then overlaid with an image of Dr. House's face taken from the pilot episode with the show's full title appearing across his face. House's head then fades and the show's title is underlined and has the "M.D." appear next to it, producing the entire logo of the show. This was the full extent of the title sequence in the pilot episode.[70] All subsequent episodes contain a longer sequence including the names of the six featured cast members and creator David Shore. Laurie's name appears first, followed by the names of the five other featured cast members in alphabetical order (Edelstein, Epps, Leonard, Morrison, Spencer, then Shore).[71]After the show's title fades, there is an aerial view of PPTH (actually various Princeton University buildings, primarily Frist Campus Center).[67] This is followed by a series of images accompanying each cast member's name; most are shown next to, or superimposed upon, illustrations of the human anatomy. Laurie's name appears next to a model of a human head with the brain exposed; Edelstein's name appears next to a visual effectsproduced graphic of nerve axons; Epps's name is superimposed upon a rib cage X-ray; Leonard's name appears on a drawing of the two hemispheres of the brain.[71] The producers originally wanted to include an image of a cane and an image of a Vicodin bottle, but Fox objected. Morrison's title card was thus lacking an image; an aerial shot of rowers on Princeton University's Lake Carnegie was finally agreed upon to accompany her name.[72] Spencer's name appears next to an old-fashioned anatomical drawing of a spine. Between the presentations of Spencer's and Shore's names is a scene of House and his three original team members walking down one of the hospital's hallways.[71] Jacobs said that most of the backgrounds have no specific meaning; however, the final imagethe text "created by David Shore" superimposed upon a human neckconnotes that Shore is "the brain of the show".[72] The sequence was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design in 2005.[73] The title sequence continued to credit Spencer and Morrison, even when their characters were reduced to background roles during seasons four and five, and Morrison even after hers was written out. A new opening sequence was introduced in season seven to accommodate the changes in the cast, removing Morrison's name and including Jacobson and Wilde's.[74][75]The series' original opening theme, as heard in the United States, comprises instrumental portions of "Teardrop" by Massive Attack.[76][77] An acoustic version of "Teardrop", with guitar and vocals by Jos Gonzlez, is heard as background music during the season four finale.[78]Anytime you try to summarize a show in one word, you sound like an ass. It's about truth.Gregory House, M.D., often construed as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey.[70] Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a pre-credits scene set outside the hospital, showing events ending with the onset of the patient's symptoms.[17] The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness,[76][80] which often fail until the patient's condition is critical.[76] They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed,[67] and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting.[17] The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices,[dubious  discuss] and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.[3]The team employs the differential diagnosis method,[80] listing possible etiologies on a whiteboard, then eliminating most of them, usually because one of the team (most often House) provides logical reasons for ruling them out.[81] Typically the patient is misdiagnosed at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless;[80] this usually causes further complications, butas the nature of the complications often provides valuable new evidenceeventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly.[17] House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character.[80] Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases.[82]The team face many diagnostic difficulties from patients' concealment of symptoms, circumstances, or personal histories, so House frequently proclaims during the team's deliberations, "The patient is lying", or mutters "Everybody lies"; such an assumption guides House's decisions and diagnoses,[9] and makes the countermeasure of housebreaking a routine procedure. Because many of his hypotheses are based on epiphanies or controversial insights, he often has trouble obtaining permission for medical procedures he considers necessary from his superior, who in all but the final season is hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy.[83] This is especially the case when the proposed procedures involve a high degree of risk or are ethically questionable. There are frequent disagreements between House and his team,[84] especially Dr. Allison Cameron, whose standards of medical ethics are more conservative than those of the other characters.[76]Like all of the hospital's doctors, House is required to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic.[70][85] His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief.[76][86] During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments.[70] However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses.[15] Analogies with some of the simple cases in the clinic often[dubious  discuss] inspire insights that help solve the team's case.[17][87]It's not a show about addiction, but you can't throw something like this into the mix and not expect it to be noticed and commented on. There have been references to the amount of his consumption increasing over time. It's becoming less and less useful a tool for dealing with his pain, and it's something we're going to continue to deal with, continue to explore.A significant plot element is House's use of Vicodin to manage pain, caused by an infarction in his quadriceps muscle five years before the show's first season, which also forces him to use a cane.[89] In the first season; eleventh episode "Detox", House admits he is addicted to Vicodin, but says he does not have a problem because the pills "let me do my job, and they take away my pain".[b] His addiction has led his colleagues, Cuddy and Dr. James Wilson, to encourage him to go to drug rehabilitation several times.[90] When he has no access to Vicodin or experiences unusually intense pain, he occasionally self-medicates with other narcotic analgesics such as morphine,[91] oxycodone,[92] and methadone.[93] House also frequently drinks liquor when he is not on medical duty, and classifies himself as a "big drinker".[94] Toward the end of season five, House begins to hallucinate; after eliminating other possible diagnoses, he and Wilson determine that his Vicodin addiction is the most likely cause.[95] House goes into denial about this for a brief time, but at the close of the season finale, he commits himself to Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital.[96] In the following season's debut episode, House leaves Mayfield with his addiction under control.[97] However, about a year and a half later, in season seven's 15th episode, "Bombshells", House reacts to the news that Cuddy possibly has kidney cancer by taking Vicodin,[98] and his addiction recurs.[99]Throughout House's run, six of the main actors have received star billing. All of them play doctors who work at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey.[70] Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), the title character, heads the Department of Diagnostic Medicine.[106] House describes himself as "a board-certified diagnostician with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology".[107] Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), House's one true friend, is the head of the Department of Oncology.[108] Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), an endocrinologist,[109] is House's boss, as she is the hospital's dean of medicine and chief administrator.[110] House has a complex relationship with Cuddy, and their interactions often involve a high degree of innuendo and sexual tension.[111] In the sixth episode of season five, "Joy", they kiss for the first time.[112] Their physical relationship does not progress any further during the fifth season; in the finale, House believes he and Cuddy had sex, but this is a hallucination brought on by House's Vicodin addiction.[96] In the finale of season six, Cuddy tells House she loves him. They kiss and agree to try being a couple.[113] Throughout season seven, House and Cuddy try to make their relationship work.House's original team of diagnosticians consists of Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), a neurologist; Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), an intensivist; and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), an immunologist.[110] In the season three episode "Family", Foreman announces his resignation, telling House, "I don't want to turn into you".[c] During the season finale, House tells Chase that he has either learned everything he can, or nothing at all, and dismisses him from the team. Cameron, who has developed an affection for Chase, soon resigns.[54] This leaves House without a team for the season four premiere.[114]Under orders from Cuddy to recruit a new team, House considers forty doctors.[94] Season four's early episodes focus on his selection process, structured as a reality TVstyle elimination contest[94] (Jacobs referred to it as a "version of Survivor").[115] House assigns each applicant a number between 1 and 40, and pares them down to seven finalists.[116] He assesses their performance in diagnostic cases, assisted by Foreman, who returns to the department after his dismissal from another hospital for House-like behavior.[116][117][118] While Foreman's return means there are only two open slots, House tricks Cuddy into allowing him to hire three new assistants.[119] He ultimately selects Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), a former plastic surgeon; Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn), a sports medicine specialist; and Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley (Olivia Wilde), an internist (nicknamed for her number in the elimination contest).[119][120] In the season finale, Thirteen discovers she has, as she had long dreaded, Huntington's disease, which is incurable.[78]In the eleventh episode of season five, "Joy to the World", Foreman and Thirteen engage in a passionate kiss.[24] Thirteen is at first reluctant to start a relationship with Foreman, but the two eventually begin dating and are still together at the end of the season.[96] They break up early in season six. In the twentieth episode of season 5, "Simple Explanation", Kutner is found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. Because Kutner left no note, House suspects foul play, though the death is accepted by the other characters as a suicide.[121]In the seventh episode of season two, "Hunting", Cameron and Chase have a one-night stand.[122] In the middle of season three, they initiate a sexual relationship that Cameron insists be casual;[109] when Chase declares that he "wants more", Cameron ends the affair.[123] By the end of the season, however, Cameron recognizes that she has romantic feelings for Chase and they begin a serious relationship.[54] After leaving the diagnostic team, they assume different roles at the PPTH, Cameron as a senior attending physician in the emergency room[d] and Chase as a surgeon.[94] They become engaged in the season five episode "Saviors" (the episode immediately following Kutner's suicide)[61] and are married in the season finale.[124] When Chase rejoins House's team in season six, Cameron leaves her husband and the hospital in "Teamwork", the season's eighth episode.[125] She returns as a guest character in "Lockdown", nine episodes later.[126]Early in season seven, Thirteen takes an unexplained leave of absence. Cuddy orders House to fill her position with another woman,[127] but eventually makes the choice for him: medical student Martha M. Masters (Amber Tamblyn), who makes her first appearance in the season's sixth episode.[128] Thirteen returns in the "The Dig"the season's 18th episode and the show's 150thin which the reason for her absence is revealed: she was in prison for six months for having helped euthanize her brother, who was suffering from advanced Huntington's.[129] While Jacobson and Wilde play central characters (as did Penn), they did not receive star billing until season seven. They were credited as "Also Starring", with their names appearing after the opening sequence.[130] In season seven, Jacobson and Wilde received star billing; new regular cast member Tamblyn did not.[131]The first six seasons of House each included one or more recurring featured characters, who appear in multi-episode story arcs.[132] In season one, Edward Vogler (Chi McBride), the billionaire owner of a pharmaceutical company, appears in five episodes.[133] He donates US$100 million to the PPTH in return for chairing its board.[134] Vogler represented an attempt to introduce a villain, a move urged by Fox. By the time the Vogler episodes began to air, the show had become a hit and the character was soon dropped.[133] Shore said the concept of a villainous boss was not really viable for the series: "It's called House. The audience knows he'll never get fired."[9]Stacy Warner (Sela Ward), House's ex-girlfriend,[135] appears in the final two episodes of the first season, and seven episodes of season two.[9] She wants House to treat her husband, Mark Warner (Currie Graham), whom House diagnoses with acute intermittent porphyria in the season one finale.[135] Stacy and House grow close again, but House eventually tells Stacy to go back to Mark, which devastates her.[136]Michael Tritter (David Morse), a police detective, appears in several season three episodes. He tries to extract an apology from House, who left Tritter in an examination room with a thermometer in his rectum.[137] After House refuses to apologize, Tritter brings him up on charges of unprescribed narcotics possession and forces him to attend rehab. When the case reaches court, Cuddy lies for House and the case is dismissed. The judge reprimands Tritter for pursuing House to excess, and tells House that she thinks he "has better friends than he deserves", referring to Cuddy's 11th-hour testimony on his behalf. House is sentenced to one night in jail for contempt of court and finishes his rehabilitation under the influence of Vicodin.[90]The candidates for House's new diagnostics team are season four's primary recurring characters.[138] In addition to the three who are chosen, the other four finalists are Jeffrey Cole (Edi Gathegi); Travis Brennan (Andy Comeau), an epidemiologist;[138] Henry Dobson (Carmen Argenziano), a former medical school admissions officer;[94] and Amber "Cut-throat Bitch" Volakis (Anne Dudek), an interventional radiologist.[120] Each of the four departs the show after elimination, except for Volakis, who appears throughout the season, having started a relationship with Wilson.[139][140] In the two-part season finale, Volakis attempts to shepherd a drunken House home when Wilson is unavailable. They are involved in a bus crash, which leads to her death.[78][141] She reappears late in season five among the hallucinations House suffers.[61]Private investigator Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston), a character inspired in part by Shore's love of The Rockford Files, appears in three episodes of season five.[142][143] House initially hires Douglas to spy on Wilson, who has ended their friendship after Volakis's death (the friendship is subsequently rekindled). House later pays Douglas to look into the private lives of his team members and Cuddy.[144] If the character was accepted by the audience, there were plans to feature him as the lead in a spin-off show.[145] In September 2008, Shore spoke to Entertainment Weekly about his vision for the character: "I don't want to do just another medical show. What does excite me in terms of writing is the choices people make and the nature of right and wrong... and a private investigator can approach that question much more readily than a doctor can."[146] There was no show featuring Douglas on the fall 2009 network television schedule.[147] He returns to House in season six as Cuddy's boyfriend.[148] They are briefly engaged until Cuddy breaks it off, realizing that she is in love with House.[149]House received largely positive reviews on its debut;[150] the series was considered a bright spot amid Fox's schedule, largely filled with reality shows.[151] Matt Roush of TV Guide said that the program was an "uncommon cure for the common medical drama".[152] New York Daily News critic David Bianculli applauded the "high caliber of acting and script".[66] The Onion's "A.V. Club" approvingly described it as the "nastiest" black comedy from FOX since 1996's short-lived Profit.[153] New York's John Leonard called the series "medical TV at its most satisfying and basic",[154] while The Boston Globe's Matthew Gilbert appreciated that the show did not sugarcoat the flaws of the characters to assuage viewers' fears about "HMO factories".[155] Variety's Brian Lowry, less impressed, wrote that the show relied on "by-the-numbers storytelling, albeit in a glossy package".[156] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle described it as "mediocre" and unoriginal.[157]General critical reaction to the character of Gregory House was particularly positive.[150][158] Tom Shales of The Washington Post called him "the most electrifying new main character to hit television in years".[159] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Rob Owen found him "fascinatingly unsympathetic".[160] Critics have compared House to fictional detectives Nero Wolfe,[161] Hercule Poirot, and Adrian Monk,[162] and to Perry Cox, a cantankerous doctor on the television show Scrubs.[151][160] One book-length study of the series finds a powerful kinship between House and another famous TV doctor, Hawkeye Pierce of M*A*S*H.[163] Laurie's performance in the role has been widely praised.[76][161][164] The San Francisco Chronicle's Goodman called him "a wonder to behold" and "about the only reason to watch House".[157] Gabrielle Donnelly of the Daily Mail said that because of Laurie's complex personality, he was "perfectly cast" in the title role.[44]Critics have also reacted positively to the show's original supporting cast, which the Post's Shales called a "first-rate ensemble".[159] Leonard's portrayal of Dr. Wilson has been considered Emmy Award worthy by critics with TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly, and USA Today.[165][166] Bianculli of the Daily News was happy to see Edelstein "finally given a deservedly meaty co-starring role".[66] Freelance critic Daniel Fienberg was disappointed that Leonard and Edelstein have not received more recognition for their performances.[167]Reaction to the major shifts of season four was mixed. "With the new crew in place House takes on a slightly more energized feel", wrote Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk. "And the set up for the fifth season is quite brilliant."[168] The Star-Ledger's Alan Sepinwall wrote, "The extended, enormous job audition gave the writers a chance to reinvigorate the show and fully embrace Laurie's comic genius".[132] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times, on the other hand, took issue with the developments: "the cast just kept getting bigger, the stories more scattered and uneven until you had a bunch of great actors forced to stand around watching Hugh Laurie hold the show together by the sheer force of his will".[169] USA Today's Robert Bianco cheered the season finale: "Talk about saving the best for last. With two fabulous, heartbreaking hours... the writers rescued a season that had seemed diffuse, overcrowded and perhaps too ambitious for its own good."[166]In contrast to the acclaim the series had earlier received, season five of House met with relatively poor notices. A. A. Gill of The Sunday Times felt that the show had "lost its sense of humour".[170] The Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan wrote, "House used to be one of the best shows on TV, but it's gone seriously off the rails".[171] Though McNamara of the Los Angeles Times found detective Lucas Douglas a "delightful addition" to the season's early episodes,[169] Ryan saw him as an "unwelcome distraction... an irritating pipsqueak".[143] The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman came in for particular criticism.[132][172]At the end of the show's run, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote that "House had, in its final seasons, become a rather sentimental show".[173] In New York Magazine's blog Vulture, Margaret Lyons wrote, "More than a hospital drama or a character piece or anything else, House is a complex meditation on misery." But, continued Lyons, there is a line between "enlightened cynicism" and "misery-entropy", and "as the show wore on, its dramatic flare dimmed while its agony flare burned ever brighter."[174] Alan Sepinwall wrote, "The repetition and muck of [the] middle seasons ultimately severed whatever emotional connection I had to House's personal struggles."[25]The show placed #62 on Entertainment Weekly's "New TV Classics" list.[175] The show was declared the second highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002-2012).[176]After its first five seasons, House was included in various critics' top ten lists; these are listed below in order of rank.Since its premiere, House has been consistently popular. In its first season, when it ranked twenty-fourth among all television series, House was the ninth most popular primetime program among women.[182] Aided by a lead-in from the widely popular American Idol,[183] the following three seasons of the program each ranked in the top ten among all viewers. House reached its peak Nielsen ratings in its third season, attracting an average of 19.4 million viewers per episode.[184] According to Jacobs, the production team was surprised that the show garnered such a large audience.[185] In its fifth season, the show attracted 12.0 million viewers per episode and slipped to nineteenth place overall. It remained Fox's most popular show other than American Idol.[186]The most-watched episode of House is the season four episode "Frozen",[187] which aired after Super Bowl XLII.[188][189] It attracted slightly more than 29 million viewers.[190] House ranked third for the week, equalling the rating of American Idol and surpassed only by the Super Bowl itself and the post-game show.[191] Below is a table of House's seasonal rankings in the U.S. television market, based on average total viewers per episode. Each U.S. network television season starts in September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.House has redefined the medical television show. No longer a world where an idealized doctor has all the answers or a hospital where gurneys race down the hallways, House's focus is on the pharmacologicaland the intellectual demands of being a doctor. The trial-and-error of new medicine skillfully expands the show beyond the format of a classic procedural, and at the show's heart, a brilliant but flawed physician is doling out the prescriptionsa fitting symbol for modern medicine.House has received many awards and award nominations. In 2005, 2007, and 2008, Laurie was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.[202] The Emmy board also nominated House for Outstanding Drama Series in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, but the show has yet to win the award.[203] For the season one episode "Three Stories", David Shore won a writing Emmy in 2005[73][204] and the Humanitas Prize in 2006.[205] Director Greg Yaitanes received the 2008 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing - Drama Series, for directing "House's Head", the first part of season four's two-episode finale.[206]The show has been nominated for six Golden Globe Awards and received two. Hugh Laurie has been nominated four times for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Drama; he won in 2006[207][208] and again in 2007.[209][210] In 2008 the series received its first nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series - Drama.[211] House was nominated for best dramatic series again the following year, but has yet to win in the category.[212]The show received a 2005 Peabody Award for what the Peabody board called an "unorthodox lead charactera misanthropic diagnostician" and for "cases fit for a medical Sherlock Holmes", which helped make House "the most distinctive new doctor drama in a decade".[213] The American Film Institute (AFI), included House in its 2005 list of 10 Television Programs of the Year.[201]In 2011, House won four People's Choice Awards: favorite TV drama; favorite dramatic actor and actress for Laurie and Edelstein; and favorite TV doctor.[214]Laurie won the Screen Actors Guild's award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series in both 2007 and 2009.[215] Writer Lawrence Kaplow won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2006 for the season two episode "Autopsy".[216] In 2007, the show won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for prosthetic makeup.[217]In 2005, Laurie appeared on the cover of TV Guide as "TV's Sexiest Man".[182] In 2008, Gregory House was voted second sexiest television doctor ever, behind ER's Doug Ross (George Clooney).[44][218]In 2008, House was distributed in a total of 66 countries. With an audience of over 81.8 million worldwide, it was the most watched television show on the globe and far surpassed the viewership figures of the leading TV dramas the previous two years (CSI and CSI: Miami).[219][220] The following year, it placed second in the world after CSI.[221]House episodes premiere on Fox in the United States and Global in Canada, which have identical schedules.[222] The show was the third most popular on Canadian television in 2008.[223] That same year, House was the top-rated television program in Germany,[224] the number 2 show in Italy,[225] and number 3 in the Czech Republic.[226] The series is also very popular in France,[227] Spain,[228] Sweden, and the Netherlands.[229] In the United Kingdom, the first four seasons were broadcast on Five. Sky1 acquired first-run rights beginning with season five.[230] The original, English-language version of the show also airs in Australia on Network Ten,[231] in New Zealand on TV3,[232] and in Ireland on 3e, TV3's cable channel.[233]Episodes of the show are also available online for download: Amazon Video on Demand, iTunes Store and the Zune Marketplace offer episodes from all of seasons 1 through 6, with episodes from the current season (season 7)[citation needed] appearing one week after they air live on television.[234] In 2007, NBC Universal (the show's distributor) and Apple Inc. (iTunes' owner) had a disagreement that temporarily kept the fourth season off iTunes.[235] In a statement to the press, Apple claimed that NBC Universal wanted to drive up the per-episode price to $4.99.[236] In September 2008, it was reported that the issue between Apple and NBC had been resolved.[237] Episodes can now also be purchased in HD on iTunes for $2.99.[238] Recent episodes are available in streaming video on Fox's official House webpage[239] and on Hulu.com.[240]The first seven seasons of the show were released on DVD encoded for regions 1, 2 and 4. A boxed set comprising seasons one through seven has been issued, as well.[241] Universal Studios Home Entertainment announced plans to rerelease the first season in region 1 in anamorphic widescreen (the original release is letterboxed).[242] It is unclear if the DVDs will be re-released with anamorphic widescreen in regions 2 and 4, where they have been presented in 4:3 fullscreen.[243][244]For a charity auction, T-shirts bearing the phrase "Everybody Lies" were sold for a limited time starting on April 23, 2007, on Housecharitytees.com. Proceeds from sales of those shirts and others with the phrase "Normal's Overrated" went to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).[245][246] House cast and crew members also regularly attend fundraisers for NAMI and have featured in ads for the organization that have appeared in Seventeen and Rolling Stone. The show's efforts have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the charity. Jacobs said that through their association with NAMI, they hope to take "some of the stigma off that illness".[247]Nettwerk released the House M.D. Original Television Soundtrack album on September 18, 2007.[248] The soundtrack includes full length versions of songs featured in House and previously unreleased songs especially recorded for the series.[249] In 2008, the Spanish game company Exelweiss designed a cellphone game for the show, which was released in both Spanish and English versions.[250]In June 2009, Legacy Interactive announced a licensing agreement with Universal Pictures Digital Platforms Group (UPDPG) to develop a video game based on the series, in which players step into the roles of House's diagnostic team to deal with five unusual medical cases.[251] The game, released in May 2010, included a minigame calling upon the player to "navigat[e] a restaurant-placemat-style maze, in which a giant sandwich must avoid hungry physicians on its way to Dr. House's office." It received an F from The A.V. Club,[252] however Legacy had updated the game by August 2010.[252]House at TV.com  1 Production

Psych is an American detective comedy-drama television series created by Steve Franks and broadcast on USA Network. It stars James Roday as Shawn Spencer, a young crime consultant for the Santa Barbara Police Department whose "heightened observational skills"[1] and impressive detective instincts allow him to convince people that he solves cases with psychic abilities. The program also stars Dul Hill as Shawn's best friend and reluctant partner Burton "Gus" Guster, as well as Corbin Bernsen as Shawn's captious father, Henry.The series airs new episodes in the U.S. on Wednesdays at 9PM ET/PT, 9PM CST on USA Network. During the second season, an animated segment was added to the series titled "The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus". Psych debuted on Friday, July 7, 2006, immediately following the fifth season premiere of Monk, and continued to be paired with the series until Monk's conclusion on December 4, 2009. It was the highest-rated U.S. basic cable television premiere of 2006.[2] The sixth season ended on April 11, 2012. It is currently USA Network's longest-running original series on air.[3] On January 10, 2012, USA renewed the series for a seventh season, to include 16 episodes. [4] Psych will begin its seventh season on February 27, 2013.[5]Most episodes begin with a cold open in the form of a flashback to Shawn and Gus's childhood. The flashbacks usually involve Shawn and Gus being taught a lesson by a young Henry Spencer, who wishes that his son would follow in his footsteps and become a law enforcement officer. As a child, Shawn was taught by Henry to hone his powers of observation and deduction, often using games and challenges to test him. Each flashback also sets the theme for the episode.Shawn originally becomes known as a psychic when, after calling in tips on dozens of crime covered on the news, which help the police to close the case, the police become suspicious of his knowledge. The police theorize that such knowledge could only come from the "inside" and they decide to arrest him as a suspect. To avoid being sent to jail, Shawn uses his observational skills to convince the police that he is psychic. The interim police chief warns Shawn that if his "powers" are fake, he will be prosecuted. With no choice but to keep up the act, and having proven himself an effective aid to the police in solving crimes, he establishes a psychic detective agency, Psych, and becomes a consultant to the police. Pretending to have psychic powers allows him to engage in strange and comic behavior as he turns real clues into hunches and otherworldly visitations. He enjoys teasing lifelong friend Gus, a pharmaceutical representative, about Gus's eclectic interests as they drive around in a Toyota Echo nicknamed "the blueberry" solving crimes.Head detective Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson), playfully named "Lassie" by Shawn and Gus, quietly respects Shawn's crime-solving skills but doubts his psychic abilities and is constantly exasperated by his antics. On the contrary, junior detective Juliet "Jules" O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Chief Vick (Kirsten Nelson) are far less antagonistic with O'Hara expressing belief in Shawn's abilities, while Vick is mum on the subject and usually willing to give Shawn the leeway he needs to solve cases. Henry and Shawn have a difficult relationship, but despite this, Henry reluctantly helps Shawn on various occasions.The show uses White Rock, British Columbia, Canada for its Santa Barbara, California setting.[13] Psych also incorporates Vancouver and various locations around the Lower Mainland of British Columbia as a backdrop. Santa Barbara is on a mountainous coastline without bays and just has the few Channel Islands miles offshore. Many of the overlooking helicopter shots and set up shots (in which the exterior of the Santa Barbara Courthouse is shown) are actually filmed in Santa Barbara. The animated segments "The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus" were created by J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. The music, effects and sound design for "The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus" were created by Fred Weinberg.The theme song for Psych is "I Know You Know" by The Friendly Indians, series creator Steve Franks' band. Some episodes in Seasons 3, 4, 5, and 6 use the extended full-length version of "I Know You Know", but most episodes use the usual, shortened version. In some episodes the theme song is changed, usually as a tie-in to the theme of the episode to come.The Christmas and Hindi-themed variations of the song also include variations on the main titles. In particular, the Hindi and Chinese-themed episodes phonetically translated words into Devanagari and Chinese characters, respectively, in their title sequences. The theme in the Twin Peaks tribute is an almost shot-for-shot recreation of the Twin Peaks theme.Since the series first aired, a pineapple has been a recurring theme, with one visible or with an implied presence in every episode. The pineapple is a major marketing point for items related to the show on the USA website.[15] There is also a website that is dedicated to finding a pineapple or pineapple related object in each episode.[16]Psych scored a 4.51 rating and an average of 6.1 million total viewers at its premiere, which made it the highest rated scripted series premiere on basic cable in 2006 in all key demographics (households, P18-49, P25-54, and total viewers), according to a USA Network press release, quoted from the Futon Critic.[2]From the San Jose Mercury News:From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer:Seasons one through six are available on DVD in Region 1, while seasons one, two, and three are available in Regions 2 and 4.

However, it is really his exceptional observational skills and eidetic memory that allow him to obtain his "visions". He refuses to take anything seriously, though has matured slowly throughout the seasons. He has had romantic tension with Juliet since they met, which led them to start dating in the middle of season 5. In the middle of season 6 he tries to propose to her but finds out he is not ready and Juliet is not ready. At the end of season 6 he moves in with her.Burton "Gus" Guster (Dul Hill) is Shawn's best friend since childhood as well as business partner. He also is a pharmaceuticals salesman. Unlike Shawn, he takes his work very seriously, playing the "straight man" and usually tries to act professionally, yet in later episodes he ends up as invested in jokes and snacks like Shawn. He is famous for his many aliases (usually given to him by Shawn), including "Magic Head", "Lavender Gooms", "Ghee Buttersnaps", and "Control Alt Delete". He is known for being attracted to all types of women, who usually end up as the criminal. He is also known for his super sensitive nose, the "Super Sniffer" or "Super Smeller".Carlton "Lassie" Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) is the head detective for the Santa Barbara Police Department. He is skeptical of Shawn's psychic abilities, and is extremely annoyed by Shawn's comic antics. However, he once secretly confessed to Shawn while drunk that he respects him and because of this he occasionally comes to Psych for help with his more difficult cases.Juliet "Jules" O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) is a junior detective for the Santa Barbara Police Department, and is Lassiter's partner. She joined the SBPD after Lassiter's old partner got transferred in season 1, and was originally a cop in Miami. Throughout the series she and Shawn share constant romantic tension, and the two start dating in season 5.Chief Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson) is the SBPD Chief. She is tough but fair, usually reluctant to hire Shawn and Gus for cases, but almost always gives in. She respects Shawn's help and input but firmly keeps him in check (as much as she can) when he pushes the limits of the law or her patience.Henry Spencer (Corbin Bernsen) is Shawn's uptight and precise father and a former police sergeant. He trained Shawn on everything about being a detective, going so far as teaching him to remember the layout of a room with his eyes closed and beating a lie detector. He is usually visited by Shawn with questions about various cases, but is usually reluctant to help. He has been rehired to the SBPD to be in charge of the department's consultants, much to Shawn's chagrin. At the end of Season 6, Henry quit the SBPD and then was shot by a former police partner after finding out he was being paid to cover up cases for criminals in the season's cliffhanger ending.Young Shawn (Seasons 15: Liam James; Seasons 5present: Skyler Gisondo) is the younger version of Shawn Spencer. He is shown at the beginning of most episodes in flashbacks to the late 1980s and early 1990s, usually learning a life lesson from his father, which helps him later in the episode. He has also been portrayed in various episodes by Josh Hayden and Kyle Pejpar.Young Gus (Carlos McCullers II) is the younger version of Burton "Gus" Guster. He is shown at the beginning of various episodes in flashbacks with Shawn. He was also portrayed by Isaah Brown during the first season.Buzz McNab (Sage Brocklebank) is a naive but lovable cop who often provides Shawn and Gus with clues. He takes every case given him by Lassiter and Juliet with a polite, optimistic attitude, despite both Lassiter and Jules finding said case to be menial. Shawn gives him a "little boy cat" (that is actually a girl cat) that once helped him solve a case in season one. In "Shawn Gets the Yips" (4.05), McNab is severely injured when a bomb went off in his mailbox while he was getting his mail. Later in the episode, he returns to work with a severe concussion and on crutches, but alive; he remarks to Shawn and Gus that he had lost part of three toes, though, and when Shawn coughs from dehydration (he thought that his elliptical trainer was rigged with a bomb and a motivational note written by Jules said if his heart rate got below 150 beats/min he would die), he immediately begins to go get Shawn a drink of water before being told numerous times that he should rest. He has occasionally pulled Shawn over for various traffic violations only to realize that it is him and apologize. In the fourth season finale episode, "Mr. Yin Presents..." (4.16), McNab is attacked and knocked unconscious by the unseen killer, otherwise known as Yin, but survives. He returns in season 5.Madeleine Spencer (Cybill Shepherd) is a police psychologist who is Shawn's mother and Henry's ex-wife. In the episode "Ghosts" (3.01), she tells Lassiter that she has eidetic tonal memory, which is like Shawn's photographic memory but with sound. She appears in "Ghosts" (3.01), "Murder? ... Anyone? ... Anyone? ... Bueller?" (3.02), "An Evening with Mr. Yang" (3.16), and "Yang 3 in 2D" (5.16). She was portrayed over-the-shoulder by a different actress in "Shawn (and Gus) of the Dead" (2.16).Abigail Lytar (Rachael Leigh Cook) is Shawn's high school crush, whom he let get away when he moved from, then back to, Santa Barbara and his parents got divorced. She first appears in "Murder? ... Anyone? ... Anyone? ... Bueller?" (3.02) and returns in "An Evening with Mr. Yang" (3.16), "He Dead" (4.02), "Bollywood Homicide" (4.06), and "You Can't Handle This Episode" (4.10). In "You Can't Handle This Episode", the winter half premiere of Season 4, Abigail departs for Uganda. However, she returns in the episode "Mr. Yin Presents..." (4.16). After being kidnapped by Yin and saved by Shawn, she tells him she does not like danger and breaks up with him after the two share a final kiss.Winnie Guster (Phylicia Rashad) is Gus' mother. She appears in the first two of the series' Christmas episodes, "Gus's Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy" (2.10) and "Christmas Joy" (3.09).Bill Guster (Ernie Hudson, Keith David) is Gus' father. Although the character of Gus' father appeared in the first two Christmas episodes, Bill Guster was played by Ernie Hudson in "Gus's Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy" and by Keith David in "Christmas Joy".Mr. Yang (Ally Sheedy) is a serial killer, first appearing in "An Evening with Mr. Yang" (3.16). She returns after a decade-long absence to target Shawn in her deadly game of cat-and-mouse. In the season four finale, "Mr. Yin Presents..." (4.16), Shawn and Gus visit her in prison. She seems to have a deeper connection to Shawn, as the last scene of "Mr. Yin Presents..." shows Yin, Yang's partner, looking at a picture of what is presumably a younger Yang, standing next to young Shawn. Her help is enlisted again by Shawn and Gus in "Yang 3 in 2D", the fifth season's finale, in which it is revealed that she is actually Yin's daughter.Mary Lightly (Jimmi Simpson) was a department psychologist who was an expert on Mr. Yang. He first appeared in "An Evening with Mr. Yang" (3.16) and later in "Mr. Yin Presents..." (4.16). He was stabbed to death in the season four finale by Yin while bravely trying to capture him alone. He appears on videotape in "Yang 3 in 2D" (5.16) as well.Woody the Coroner (Kurt Fuller) is a police coroner that Shawn shares a mutual respect with. His wife cheats on him with multiple men, some of whom he has approved. He is also apparently wanted in the Philippines. He first appeared in "High Top Fade Out" (4.07).[6]Mr. Yin (Christopher Turner, Peter Weller) was a serial killer who was actually responsible for the Yang murders. He is also Yang's father. He first appeared in "Mr. Yin Presents..." (4.16) targeting Shawn, and later returned for a second round in "Yang 3 in 2D" (5.16), in which he is murdered by his daughter.Pierre Despereaux (Cary Elwes) is an extremely elusive Canadian art thief. He first appeared in "Extradition: British Columbia" (4.01). When Shawn and Gus travel to Canada on a ski trip they end up catching him. However, it is revealed that he, in fact, is simply an insurance fraudster. Despereaux returned in "Extradition II: The Actual Extradition Part" (5.10), in which he was accused of multiple murders after his escape from prison. He was later cleared of the murder charges and finally extradited to the United States. He makes a return in the episode "Indiana Shawn and the Temple of the Kinda Crappy, Rusty Old Dagger" (6.10), in which he races with Shawn and Gus against a gang of art thieves to find an old dagger.Declan Rand (Nestor Carbonell) is a rich criminal profiler so good at his job that he poses a threat to Shawn. He turns out to be a fake criminal profiler and knows that Shawn is not a real psychic. His first appearance was in "Shawn 2.0" (5.08), and his most recent appearance was in "One, Maybe Two, Ways Out" (5.09). In "Extradition II: The Actual Extradition Part" (5.10), Juliet announces that she and Declan broke up.Marlowe Viccellio (Kristy Swanson) is a woman Lassiter meets and becomes romantically involved with. It is later discovered that she has been stealing blood in order to help her dying brother, and she is sent to prison. Despite this, her relationship with Lassiter continues. She first appears in "This Episode Sucks" (6.03) and later in "Let's Doo-Wop It Again" (6.13).Frank O'Hara (William Shatner) is a talented con man who uses his talents to fool the Santa Barbara Police Department. Shawn figured out his schemes, but told him he wouldn't give him up if he mended his relationship with Juliet. Juliet figures it out but he tries to right his wrongs by solving the crime. Juliet is slowly starting to have a better relationship with him. He first appears in "In for a Penny", and again in "Indiana Shawn and the Temple of the Kinda Crappy, Rusty Old Dagger."The theme was given a Christmas theme for the episode "Gus's Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy" (2.10). It was used again in "Christmas Joy" (3.09) and "The Polarizing Express" (5.14).The song was sung in Spanish for "Lights, Camera... Homicidio" (2.13).It was expanded into Bollywood-themed version sung in Hindi in "Bollywood Homicide" (4.06).Boyz II Men performed an a cappella version of the theme for "High Top Fade Out" (4.07). It was used again for the episode "Let's Doo-Wop It Again" (6.13).In the season 5 premiere, "Romeo and Juliet and Juliet" (5.01), the main titles are translated in Chinese. However, the actual theme song itself is not edited.Curt Smith of Tears for Fears guest starred in "Shawn 2.0" (5.08) and recorded his own version of the theme. Smith also recorded a song ("This is Christmas") for the episode "The Polarizing Express" (5.14).[14]Julee Cruise, who recorded the theme for Twin Peaks, recorded a slower, extended version of the theme for the Twin Peaks-inspired episode "Dual Spires" (5.12).A superhero-themed version was recorded for "The Amazing Psych-Man & Tap Man, Issue #2" (6.04). The main titles were also re-done in a comic book style.For the episode "Heeeeere's Lassie" (6.11), the song and main titles were given a theme similar to The Shining.Psych was the winner of the Independent Investigations Group Annual Award for "Excellence in Entertainment" for advancing the cause of science and exposing superstition.

Blue Collar TV is a television program that aired on The WB Television Network with lead actors Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy. The show's humor dealt principally with contemporary American society, and especially hillbilly, redneck, and Southern stereotypes. The show was greenlighted on the heels of the success of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. It was created by Fax Bahr and Adam Small, in addition to J.P. Williams and Jeff Foxworthy. Blue Collar is a US phrase used to describe manual laborers, as opposed to White Collar for office or professional workers.Fellow Blue Collar Comedy Tour costar Ron White declined to star on Blue Collar TV due to a fear of being typecast as "blue collar." However, he guest-starred on many episodes of the show. On his 2006 comedy album, You Can't Fix Stupid, White jokingly cited his own lack of work ethic as a reason for not participating more on the show.Unlike most sketch comedy programs, each episode of Blue Collar TV was generally centered around a theme, which Foxworthy reveals at the start of each episode. Themes included "Food", "Kids", and "Stupidity", among others. Foxworthy occasionally does a comedic monologue based on the theme.The show originated from the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta. Later episodes of season 1 and all episodes of season 2 were taped at The Classic Center in Athens, Georgia, although the show taped at the House of Blues in New Orleans during a two-episode road trip in 2004. Later episodes were filmed during their Blue Collar tour.The show halted production a few weeks into the 2005 fall season. It was also removed from the lineups of both Comedy Central and the WB. No official statement was given by the WB, though Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy both confirmed the end of Blue Collar TV on their websites.Blue Collar TV returned on May 31, 2006, to finish airing its second season throughout the summer as filler for the final weeks of The WB, which would shut down later that year. The show did not move to The CW. In summer 2006, Foxworthy started his own show, Foxworthy's Big Night Out, which aired on Country Music Television and retained some aspects of the Blue Collar TV format. It was canceled after its first season. As of Summer 2010 the show is in reruns on CMT.Blue Collar TV had many guest stars during its short run. Sometimes, it was a musical guest that performs at the end of the episode. In most cases, the musical guest also takes part in at least one sketch.Guests have included:Note: Due to the show's relatively short life, no cast members were added or removed during the show's run.Season releases1 Recurring sketches2 Guest appearances3 Cast members4 DVD releases5 External links"Bad Jobs for Take Your Daughter to Work Day:" This sketch features Foxworthy, Engvall, or Larry the Cable Guy at a job with their "daughter" tagging along. Their job is always something that would make Take-Your-Daughter-To-Work-Day awkward, such as NASCAR driver or Newscaster."Big Kids:" Foxworthy, Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy play Ronnie, Blake, and Dooley, three toddlers who constantly misbehave and annoy their parents, usually from the back seat of their car."Bill The Bad Storyteller:" Bill Engvall tries to tell a story to his friends, but he's unable to tell it very well. In most cases, the story starts off interesting or creepy, but the conclusion is very plain and boring."Dan Grogan:" Grogan (Foxworthy) is the spokesman and owner of Dan Grogan's House of Gravy and Gravy Spa. Grogan's company also makes and sells Pre-chewed Food and Ranch Cleanser. Grogan's restaurants and spas are well known for their "Gravy Bombs" (balloons filled with brown gravy) and appearances by "Seargant Gravy(Engvall) & Davey the Gravy Dog"."Dinner With...:" After a short skit featuring a character saying who he wouldn't want to be invited over for dinner, the scenario is shown featuring a typical family, with that very person over for dinner. The dinner guests have included Hank Williams Jr., Joe Rogan, and Jeff Jarrett."Fat Family:" Engvall, Brooke Dillman, and Ayda Field play a family of morbidly obese people, though they are proud of their physical state and don't like skinny people or the thought of losing weight. Their appearances usually revolve around normal sitcom happenings, though modified to suit their happiness of their weight."Martha Stewart's Tips from the Inside:" Martha Stewart (Dillman) gives household hints from jail, each hint inspired by her prison experiences."The Martin Bros.:" Casey, Jack, and Dale Martin (Foxworthy, Engvall, and Larry the Cable Guy), are three unruly brothers who drink all the time, play jokes on people, and never take anything seriously. They were first seen hosting the show "Hick Eye For The Queer Guy", and later opened a party planning company."On the Red Carpet with Dee & Engle Barry:" Dee & Engle (Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy) interview big names in country music at the Country Music Awards red carpet pre show."Politically Correct Fairy Tales:" Larry the Cable Guy reads fairy tales that are now politically correct from his niece's (or nephew's) fairy tale book (Snow Caucasian and the Seven Handy Capable Little Persons, for example) to the children. He isn't impressed with the stories in their new state, and usually stops before the story is finished, (except The Tortoise and the Hare in the Non-Competitive Fun Run), to explain "how it really ends", which usually involves him going into the story, and abruptly ending it (For example, in "Vertically-Challenged Native American Riding Hood and the endangered wolf" He ends the story by saying "I go in there, I shoot the wolf, send grandma to an old folks home, get Little Red Riding Hood out of that hood, and shack up and eat wolf steaks."). Other "Politically Correct Fairy Tales" that have been told by Larry the Cable Guy:

"Jack and the Organic Beanstalk" (formerly known as Jack and the Beanstalk).
"Twas The Night Before A Non-denominational Winter Holiday" (formerly known as Twas the Night Before Christmas).
"A Child's Guide to Health and Wellness" (formerly known as Hansel and Gretel).

An example would be "Artichoke" (I "artichoke" the feller who told me to order this). Only recurring sketch used in every episode. It is published by Hatfield-McCoy and is a parody of Merriam-Webster."Redneck Yard of the Week:" Each week, Foxworthy and Ayda Field present a Redneck Yard Of The Week, as submitted by home viewers to http://www.redneckyard.com. The presentation is done like an awards ceremony, with Foxworthy providing commentary on the winning yard after the yard is shown."Rescue 911!:" A parody of the TV show of the same name, hosted by Jim Farnsworth (Foxworthy). Each episode inexplicably revolves around the Parker family, after Tom (Oldring) gets devastating injuries caused inadvertently by his grandma, followed by the dad (Larry) calling 911, and the EMT's arriving, where Jim Mayweather (Williams) suffers similar injuries, and Don Clinton (Engvall) saves the day."Tell Me That Don't Stink:" Here, Foxworthy has the female cast members (Heath and an audience member also played once each) smell a substance that doesn't smell very pleasant at all. Smelled items include doe-in-heat urine and valerian root."The Deck:" four friends sit on a deck and tell deck stories.The first with comic/actor Drew Carey."The Tacketts:" A dysfunctional redneck family, in a sitcom-like environment. Each episode involves a conflict, usually involving the bickering father and mother (Jeff and Brooke), though each episode ends happily. Also features Larry, Bill, and Ashley as the other members of the family."CSI:" based on the TV show CSI, it talks about crimes that take place, for example the Greensboro Tri-County Area, finds evidence of the crime and finds the criminal."The What Burns Me Booth:" This is a sort of testimonial booth where various people say what burns them up."White Trash Days Of Our Lives:" A spoof of Days of our Lives, which Ayda Field costars in.

Such examples have included "The Real Bachelor" (a parody of The Bachelor), "Larry the Spider Guy" (a parody of Spider-Man), and "Handicops" (a parody of COPS)."Totes TV-A skit featuring Brook, Ashley, Ayda and Bill playing a woman hosting a talk show television show with a sorority background.

Abigail "Abby" Sciuto (/uto/) is a fictional character from the NCIS television series by CBS Television, and is portrayed by Pauley Perrette. Like Jethro Gibbs, Anthony DiNozzo, and Dr. Donald Mallard, Abby was first introduced in the episodes "Ice Queen" and "Meltdown" (which together served as the backdoor pilot for NCIS) in the television show JAG, and has appeared in every episode of NCIS, in addition to being featured on the show's spin-off, NCIS: Los Angeles. The role has made Perrette the most popular actress on U.S. primetime television,[1] according to Q Score.Abby Sciuto is a forensic specialist at the Naval Criminal Investigative Service headquarters at the Washington Naval Yard, with expertise in ballistics, digital forensics, and DNA analysis. In the first episode for season 7, "Truth or Consequences", DiNozzo, while under the influence of a truth serum, describes her as "a paradox wrapped in an oxymoron smothered in contradictions in terms. Sleeps in a coffin. Really, the happiest goth you'll ever meet."[2] Her gothic style of dress and her interest in death and the supernatural enigmatically contrast with her generally hyperactive demeanor and enthusiasm about her work. AOL named her as number 95 on a list of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.[3]Abby has a gothic style of dress, including black dresses and t-shirts, mini-skirts, and goth jewelry, including anklets and toe rings. She wears pigtailed dyed hair (due to Perrette's hair being dyed as she is a natural blonde[4]), and has at least eleven tattoos on her neck, arms, back, ankle and other places. Her neck choker is one of her favourite pieces of jewelry. While some of the tattoos are Perrette's and real, others are makeup, such as the large cross on her back applied on occasions when Perrette shows her bare back on camera.[5] The spider web on her neck is not real either, as producer Donald Bellisario wanted the character to have a tattoo that would be visible (almost) all the time. However Perrette has expressed dislike for the spider tattoo and wishes for an episode where Abby gets it removed but so far, that hasn't happened.[5] Abby also has a stuffed hippo named "Bert" that makes flatulence noises when squeezed, which has been used for comic effect when Abby is upset. She decorates some of the areas in her lab with toys such as 'Bleeding Edge Goth' dolls and 'Teddy Scares.' The Teddy Scare 'Rita Mortis' can be seen sitting next to her computer monitor. Abby's biggest pet peeve, as revealed in Season 5's "Lost and Found" by Timothy McGee, is people who claim to be vegetarians but still eat chicken; her second biggest pet peeve is people who mishandle evidence.Abby drives a candy-apple red Ford '32 Deuce Coupe bearing a Washington, D.C. personalized vanity plate "4NS CHIK" which is prominently featured in Season 5's "Dog Tags".[6] She previously drove a hearse (mentioned in "Hiatus, Part I"), which ran poorly and had bald tires.Like Gibbs, Abby enjoys caffeine, primarily in the form of large cups of a fictional drink called "Caf-Pow." At times, when she is worried about the caffeine interfering with her sleep, she drinks "No-Caf-Pow" instead. (According to Perrette, the cups were originally filled with Hawaiian Punch, but when she stopped eating and drinking refined sugar, unsweetened cranberry juice was used instead.)[7] When changing the artwork in her lab during "Hung Out to Dry", she states that she has a "Chagall feeling", a reference to Marc Chagall, a Jewish Belarusian artist whose main works came from fantasy and dreams. Her favorite term for something out of the ordinary is "hinky". It is also shown that she enjoys attending concerts, but her failure to wear earplugs at one of them left her with temporary hearing loss the next day, forcing her to ask DiNozzo for help analyzing some audio evidence.[8]Abby has shown a tendency to become very agitated, to the point of near-panic, if any of the team are seriously hurt. When Gibbs was admitted to hospital, Abby ended up on the verge of a nervous breakdown, pacing back and forth while delivering a rambling, disjointed stream-of-consciousness plea that explained (among other things) how close she and Gibbs were, the reason she was arriving after visiting hours, how she felt about Gibbs being injured, and how important it was to her that Gibbs not die from his injuries.Abby developed a fondness for Butch, a Navy sniffer dog, in the season 5 episode "Dog Tags". She renamed it "Jethro" after Gibbs, because it was "handsome and quiet" like him. The dog was framed for the murder of a petty officer as the dog was found at the murder victim's house, but Abby proved Jethro's innocence. Afterwards, Abby forced McGee to adopt the dog, much to his dismay (as Jethro had attacked him earlier in the episode). Abby would have preferred to adopt Jethro herself, but her landlord did not allow tenants to have pets.Sciuto is well-versed in her field of study; she is rarely stumped by the puzzles that Gibbs' team present to her. Abby has been shown to have skills in traditional forensics, computer forensics, and hacking. She has implied that she has a PhD in chemistry.[9] It has been shown that she does all the work on the evidence herself. In season 3, when she was given an assistant, Charles "Chip" Sterling, she revolted but eventually learned to put up with him. However their working partnership did not last long as Abby later discovered Sterling had framed DiNozzo for murder. Exposed, Chip threatened her with a knife; she promptly subdued him, hog-tied him with duct tape, and insisted on being allowed to work alone from then on, something Jenny Shepard agreed to.It has been shown that she has a younger brother, Luca,[10] and niece.[11] She also mentioned that her grandmother was an Olympic swimmer who won a silver medal[12] and that she had an uncle named Teddy who owned a bar.[13]She also has an Uncle named Horace whom she referred to as Horace "the Haggler" during an episode. It has also been mentioned numerous times that she is a devout Roman Catholic and is on a bowling team with several nuns.In "Kill Ari Part 2" at Kate Todd's funeral, it is revealed Abby grew up in New Orleans.In the episode "Seadog", Gibbs tells Tony that Abby knows how to use sign language because both of her parents were deaf.It was stated in the NCIS: Los Angeles episode "Random On Purpose", Abby is in her late 20s.Abby is a hearing child adopted by deaf parents[14] and likes her music loud. Abby has stated that she dreams of visiting the Galpagos Islands, Dollywood, and Israel before she dies.[15] Abby graduated with full honors from LSU with a triple major in sociology, criminology and psychology. She earned her master's degree from Georgia State University in criminology and forensic science. Sciuto's interest in forensics came from living near a wrecking yard and being intrigued by the cause and effect of the wrecks.[15][16] The season 9 episode "Enemy on the Hill" revealed that Abby has another brother, Kyle (played by Daniel Louis Rivas), who is her biological brother, as it is revealed that Abby is in fact adopted.[17]Abby gets along well with all the rest of the team. She is very fond of Ducky, who uses her full name, Abigail. (She is called Abby or Abbs by most everyone else, except Director Leon Vance, who calls her Ms. Sciuto.) Abby is fiercely loyal to the team, and considers them family which is shown by her distress when one or more of them is in serious danger.Abby's relationship with Tony is a friendly one, with the two making friendly, non-hostile jibes at each other, and squabbling about various topics, such as movies and personal possessions. Abby is perhaps the only member of the NCIS cast who displays a love and knowledge of movies that even comes close to matching Tony's. In "Twilight," after Tony narrowly avoids being part of an explosion on his first day back from sick leave after getting pneumonic plague, she runs at him and hugs him so hard he nearly falls over. In the episode, "Frame-Up," she almost single-handedly unravels the forensic evidence used to frame Tony of murder in order to clear his name, then subdues the killer  her assistant  when he threatens her with a knife. The explosion of Tony's car in "Bury Your Dead" causes her to become increasingly obsessed with her work, in order to prevent thoughts of his possible death. In "Reunion," after Tony, McGee and Gibbs rescue Ziva from Somalia, Abby starts with a rant criticizing Ziva for her continuing mistrust of Tony, which, in trademark Abby fashion, ends with her saying how worried she was about Ziva, and hugging her. This then sparks a confrontation between Tony and Ziva that sees their relationship restored to normal.Before her death in the line of duty, Special Agent Caitlin Todd was a close friend of Abby's. They often hung out after work, and Abby is one of the few to know what Kate's tattoo actually is. Abby was at first cold to Ziva David when the latter first arrived at NCIS, as she was the half-sister of Ari, who killed Todd. Abby would scribble over pictures of Ziva and frequently mispronounce her surname to annoy her. Later, upset by Ziva's calm response to Gibbs being injured in a bombing, Abby slapped her. Abby eventually came around, and she and Ziva became good friends. This was solidified in the episode "Capitol Offense" when Ziva, in gratitude for Abby allowing her to stay at her place (Ziva's home was being fumigated for termites), bought her a "chocoholic's choice" cupcake. The cupcake soon vanished, and Abby brought out all her forensic know-how to find it. Ultimately, it was McGee who had taken the cupcake, angering Abby and the others. At first, Ziva flinched whenever Abby would hug her given that she did not know why Abby did so, but eventually, she overcame this, and Ziva now accepts Abby's hugs with no problems.She is friendly with Medical Assistant Jimmy Palmer. She has helped him with an autopsy and "Rolfed" him when he injured himself in the morgue in "Life Before His Eyes". In "Newborn King", Palmer brings his future father in-law, Ed Slater, to NCIS. Later in the episode McGee visits Abby to see she has locked the two in the back room. Jimmy states if Slater hadn't made a comment about Abby's tattoo then they wouldn't be in time out, implying he took Abby's side. Jimmy also chose Abby to be his Best Woman at his wedding in "The Missionary Position".Abby and Gibbs have a very strong bond. Abby is one of only two characters (the other one being Ducky) to have no fear of him. Gibbs is often seen giving Abby kisses on the cheek, and hugging her, especially when she does good work on the cases she works on. Sometimes, he even massages her shoulders. He often brings her a fresh Caf-Pow when he arrives at the lab for information on a case, whether or not she has called him down to tell him about it. Gibbs generally tolerates Abby's goth dress style, knowing that she does a great job in her work, but often has to ask her to get to the point when she starts rambling. Abby sometimes turns to Gibbs when she needs to talk about something personal that is bothering her and he helps by listening to her. Both Gibbs and Abby are proficient with American Sign Language, as Abby grew up with deaf parents. On several occasions, Abby has been described as "the favorite", a fact that does not escape the rest of the team, but they do not begrudge her for it.Gibbs is also very protective of Abby, especially when she is in very serious danger. For example, in the episode "Bloodbath", she was threatened by a hit man hired by a defendant in a case in which she was testifying, which was also complicated by an ex-boyfriend, Mikel Mawher[18] (guest star, Vincent Young), against whom she had a restraining order, but who then called her in violation of the order. When Gibbs found out about this, he pointedly told Mikel, "The only reason you're still able to walk is because I never heard about you until today!"[19]Sometimes, that protectiveness extends from the rest of the team as well. For example in the episode "Spider and the Fly", Alejandro Rivera came to NCIS and began to threaten Abby for not sending in a report about the murder of Pedro Hernandez, Rivera's father, whom Gibbs had killed twenty years previously in revenge for Hernandez killing Gibbs' first wife, Shannon, and young daughter, Kelly. The entire team, including Ducky and Vance, ordered him to leave her alone and to not harass her, or to be escorted forcibly from NCIS Headquarters. Rivera eventually left of his own accord, but was later arrested for attempting to kill Gibbs and his father at a safehouse, and accidentally killing his sister, Paloma.Gibbs' concern for Abby's safety is such that he will even drop his trademark cup of coffee if she is in serious danger. Twice this occurred: in the episode "Kill Ari" when Ari shot at her while she was in her lab, the other time was in the episode "Driven" when she was trapped inside an experimental Humvee, which had been rigged to fill with exhaust fumes and suffocate its occupants.She had a relationship with McGee which she stated that she would like to keep casual during season 1. Although the relationship ended late in the same season, they both have exhibited jealousy when someone of the opposite sex pays attention to the other. There continues to be some erotic teasing and tension between the two, implied through such facts as McGee's apparent ability to describe the inside of Abby's bedroom in his novel. After finding out Abby sleeps in a coffin, he said, "You told me it was a box sofa," indicating he has at least stayed over. The implications went farther when he added, "I can't believe I slept in a coffin," and she impishly replied, "Not just slept." In the episode "Bloodbath" when Abby's life is threatened and the team sends her home with McGee, it is revealed at one point Abby kept a toothbrush at McGee's apartment.In the NCIS: Los Angeles episode "Random on Purpose", Abby, having been previously seen on video-conference or talking to someone from her lab in Washington D.C, arrived in Los Angeles to meet the OSP team as she informed them she was investigating a serial killer called the Phantom who had murdered 15 people all over the country and had also left no DNA or even physical evidence at the scenes.Having already formed a strong friendship with Eric Beale, Abby developed friendships with the Office of Special Projects (OSP) team, including G. Callen (Chris O'Donnell); Sam Hanna (LL Cool J); and most notably the operations manager Hetty Lange (Linda Hunt) who commented that Abby is "the first NCIS employee [she] has ever met with a sense of style".[20] Abby was later kidnapped by the Phantom, later revealed to be a law firm receptionist named Tom Smith who sought to kill her to keep his identity a secret as he hoped to go around, killing more people, having developed something of a taste for it.Kensi Blye, another NCIS Special Agent who is an expert in forensics praised Abby for her high levels of thinking, stating that she lived up to the hype.Although Vance mentioned that Gibbs and the NCIS MCRT team were en route to Los Angeles to rescue her, Abby was saved thanks to the efforts of the OSP team and was later seen telling Gibbs and McGee on a video-conferencing link that she was okay although their faces and voices were not shown.To date, Abby has not returned to Los Angeles nor has she reappeared in any video-conference calls which strongly suggests that her appearances in Season 1 were just a one-off. It could also be presumed that due to what happened to her in LA and for security reasons, Gibbs and Vance are unwilling to let her return to LA by herself.1 Personality2 Background3 Relationships

NCIS, formerly known as NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.The concept and characters were initially introduced in two episodes of the CBS series JAG (season eight episodes "Ice Queen" and "Meltdown"). The show, a spin-off from JAG, premiered on September 23, 2003 on CBS and, to date, has aired nine full seasons and has gone into syndicated reruns on USA Network, Cloo (formerly Sleuth), and Ion Television. Donald Bellisario is co-creator, along with Don McGill, as well as executive producer.NCIS was originally referred to as Navy NCIS during season one; "Navy" was later dropped from the title as it was redundant. In season seven, NCIS was joined by a spin-off series, NCIS: Los Angeles, starring Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J.In 2011, NCIS was voted Americas favorite television show.[1] On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed NCIS for a 10th season[2] which premiered on September 25, 2012.[3] Brian Dietzen was also promoted to series regular for season ten.[4]NCIS follows a fictional team of Naval Criminal Investigative Service Major Case Response Team (MCRT)[5] special agents headquartered at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. It is described by the actors and producers (on special features on DVD releases in the United States) as being distinguished by its comedic elements, ensemble acting, and character-driven plots.NCIS is the primary law enforcement and counter-intelligence arm of the United States Department of the Navy, which includes the United States Marine Corps. NCIS investigates all major criminal offenses (felonies)i.e., crimes punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice by confinement of more than one yearwithin the Department of the Navy. The MCRT is frequently assigned to high-profile cases such as the death of the U.S. president's military aide, a bomb situation on a U.S. Navy warship, the death of a celebrity on a reality show set on a US Marine Corps base, terrorist threats involving U.S Naval and Marine weapons and/or Naval or Marine installations, and kidnappings of Navy and Marine Corps personnel.The MCRT is led by Supervisory Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon). Gibbss team is composed of Special Agent and Senior Field Agent Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Special Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), and Special Agent (former Mossad liaison officer) Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), who replaced Caitlin "Kate" Todd (Sasha Alexander) when she was shot and killed by rogue Mossad agent Ari Haswari (Rudolf Martin) at the end of season two. The team is assisted in their investigations by Chief Medical Examiner Donald "Ducky" Mallard (David McCallum), his assistant Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen), who replaced Gerald Jackson (Pancho Demmings), and Forensic Specialist Abigail "Abby" Sciuto (Pauley Perrette).It is revealed, through flashbacks, that the head of the MCRT before Gibbs was Special Agent Mike Franks (Muse Watson), who led the unit when it was part of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS), the predecessor agency of the NCIS. Franks recruited Gibbs shortly after Gibbs' retirement from the Marine Corps, eventually retiring himself some years later. After Franks' departure, Gibbs recruited DiNozzo from the Baltimore Police Department's Homicide Section. The two were briefly joined by Vivian Blackadder (Robyn Lively), whom Gibbs recruited from the FBI. In the second part of the NCIS pilot, Blackadder allowed her emotions to nearly derail an anti-terror operation in Spain. Gibbs is noticeably disappointed; Blackadder is not present in the series' first regular episode, replaced by Caitlin Todd, a Secret Service agent who joins Gibbs' team after resigning from the Secret Service. Todd is eventually killed in the line of duty in the season two finale, and is ultimately replaced by Ziva David, who from season three to season seven is the Mossad liaison officer who eventually gains American citizenship and becomes a full agent. McGee first appears as a Field Agent assigned to the Norfolk Field Office. He uses his computer skills to aid the MCRT in subsequent investigations through the rest of season one, until he is officially promoted with his own desk at the Navy Yard in the beginning of season two.NCIS is currently led by Director Leon Vance (Rocky Carroll). The first director seen in the series, Thomas Morrow (Alan Dale), left after being promoted to Deputy Director of the Department of Homeland Security. Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) was appointed director after Morrow in the first episode of season three, the first NCIS director to be in the regular series cast list. After Shepard was killed in a shootout at the end of season five, Vancewho was assistant director of NCIS before her deathwas seen as acting director after her death and was promoted to take her place.Prior to the launch of the first season, advertisements on CBS identified the show as "Naval CIS". By the time of the launch of the first episode, NCIS was airing under the name Navy NCIS, the name it held for the entire first season. Since the "N" in NCIS stands for "Naval", the name "Navy NCIS" was technically redundant. The decision to use this name was reportedly made by CBS, over the objections of Bellisario, in order to:After its successful first season, the name of the series was shortened to NCIS.NCIS is set in the Washington, D.C. area but is filmed in Santa Clarita, California.[15] The sound stages are in Santa Clarita. The series is shot throughout southern California.It was reported in May 2007 that Donald Bellisario would be stepping down from the show.[16] Due to a disagreement with series star Mark Harmon, Bellisario's duties as showrunner/head writer were to be tasked to long-time show collaborators, including co-executive producer Chas. Floyd Johnson and Shane Brennan, with Bellisario retaining his title as executive producer.[17] In fall 2009,[clarification needed] Gary Glasberg joined the crew and became the new "day-to-day" runner of NCIS, as Shane Brennan had to focus on his new show, the spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles.[18]Nine complete seasons of NCIS have aired, with the ninth season ending on May 15, 2012. The tenth season premiered on September 25, 2012.[19] As of November 27, 2012(2012 -11-27)[update], 218 original episodes of NCIS have aired.Crossover appearances with other CBS shows:Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of NCIS.The first eight seasons of NCIS have been released in Regions 1, 2 and 4. In Germany (Region 2), seasons 14 and 68 were released in two separate sets for each season. The first season DVD omits the two introductory episodes from season eight of JAG, though they are featured on the JAG season eight DVD.In 2010, CBS Interactive and GameHouse released a mobile video game, NCIS: The Game for iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, and BREW/J2ME. The game features five different cases written by the show's writers.[70]On November 1, 2011, Ubisoft released NCIS, a video game for the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii. A Nintendo 3DS version was released on March 6, 2012. The video game was deemed as a mockery to the show by reviewers and players alike, and received a 2/10 rating on GameSpot.[71]CBS Records released the show's first soundtrack on February 10, 2009.[72] The Official TV Soundtrack is a two-disc, 22-track set that includes brand new songs from top artists featured prominently in upcoming episodes of the series as well as the shows original theme by Numeriklab[73] (available commercially for the first time) and a remix of the theme by Ministry. The set also includes songs performed by series regulars Pauley Perrette and Cote de Pablo.A sequel to the soundtrack was released on November 3, 2009. NCIS: The Official TV Soundtrack; Vol. 2 is a single disc, 12 track set that covers songs (many previously unreleased) featured throughout the seventh season of the show, including one recording titled "Bitter and Blue" by Weatherly, as well as two songs used in previous seasons.In 2009, CBS picked up an NCIS spin-off series with the title NCIS: Los Angeles.[74][75][76][77] Filming began in February 2009, with the characters introduced in a two-part NCIS episode entitled "Legend" which aired on April 28, 2009 and May 5, 2009.[75] The characters listed were: G. Callen, Lara Macy, Nate "Doc" Getz, Kensi Blye, and Sam Hanna.[78] Crew members include Michael B. Kaplan, Lev L. Spiro, Jerry London, Sheldon Epps, and Mark Saraceni.[79]Chris O'Donnell plays the lead character of G. Callen.[80] LL Cool J, plays the role of Special Agent Sam Hanna, a former Navy SEAL, who works in the undercover unit of NCIS in Los Angeles, and is also fluent in Arabic and an expert on Middle Eastern culture."[76] Peter Cambor and Daniela Ruah were confirmed to be cast as leads, playing a psychologist (called "Nate") and forensic investigator/undercover agent (called "Kensi") respectively.[78]Following the shows official pick up, Louise Lombard was not signed for the role of Special Agent Lara Macy, that she had played in the pilot. Linda Hunt and Adam Jamal Craig were confirmed to replace her, playing OSP Manager Henrietta Lange and Special Agent Dom Vail, both starring roles. Craig left the series in episode 21 of season 1, was replaced by Eric Christian Olsen playing Marty Deeks,[81] the LAPD/NCIS Liaison and Kensi's partner.Characters from NCIS have appeared in the spin-off; Leon Vance has a recurring role and Abby Sciuto appeared in the episodes "Random on Purpose" and "Killshot".NCIS: Los Angeles is created by Shane Brennan. NCIS creator Donald Bellisario sued CBS over NCIS: Los Angeles in April 2011 because of his "first opportunity" to develop a spin-off, which according to the sue Bellisario wasn't offered from CBS.[82] In June 2012 a Court judge dismissed Bellisario's sue.[83]ALMA AwardASCAP AwardBMI Film & TV AwardsCalifornia on Location AwardsEmmy AwardsNAACP Image AwardsPeople's Choice AwardsImagen Foundation AwardsYoung Artist AwardsNCIS at TV.comPolice proceduralDramaDonald P.

He was a sniper in the United States Marine Corps, achieving the rank of gunnery sergeant, until 1991 when his first wife Shannon and daughter Kelly were killed by a Mexican drug dealer.[9] Gibbs killed the drug dealer in Mexico, after being told by Special Agent Mike Franks where to find him, and joined NIS, later renamed NCIS, initially training under Franks.[10] After Franks' retirement, Gibbs became the agent in charge of the MCRT. He has been married four times, but is currently single, which is often referred to on the show. He also has a difficult relationship with his father. Gibbs and Director Shepard had a romantic relationship in the past, shown through the use of flashbacks. He is seen as somewhat of a fatherly figure to Abby and later to Ziva. Due to his senior status at NCIS, he has also carried out tasks at a higher level, such as becoming a temporary acting director for the entire agency.Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) is the senior field agent of the Major Case Response Team at NCIS. He is a former Peoria, Philadelphia, and Baltimore police officer and detective. After working on a case with Gibbs while he was a detective with Baltimore PD, he discovered his best friend and partner was a dirty cop and quit from the police and joined NCIS in 2001.[11] Ducky considers DiNozzo to be a younger version of Gibbs, using his "gut" to solve cases (e.g., in the episode "Collateral Damage").[12] Considered a notorious womanizer, his behavior even irritates the females he works with, although his behavior has been shown to change as the character developed. DiNozzo is a movie expert and sometimes his expert knowledge can irritate his coworkers.Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) is a Special Agent on the Major Case Response Team since season seven. For her first four years in the show, she was a part of the NCIS team as a Mossad Liaison Officer. David replaced Special Agent Kate Todd, who was killed by David's half-brother, Ari. She later killed Ari to save Gibbs' life; by doing so she earned Gibbs' trust. In the season seven premiere, "Truth or Consequences", David is rescued from North Africa by Gibbs, DiNozzo, and McGee, where she had been held captive during a mission for Mossad. David eventually returned to the U.S. and resigned from Mossad, becoming a probationary NCIS agent and a US citizen, and (in the season nine premiere) a full-fledged agent.Abigail "Abby" Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) is a forensics specialist working with the Major Case Response Team. She has an affinity for goth fashion and a passion for Caf-Pow, a fictional high caffeine beverage. She has a close friendship with McGee, and claims to be Gibbs' favorite[13].Timothy McGee (Sean Murray) is a Special Agent on the Major Case Response Team. He has a degree in computer forensics from MIT and a degree in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins, and, along with Abby Sciuto (with whom he was briefly intimate and remains close friends), acts as the team's technology specialist. McGee was originally assigned to the Norfolk Naval Base, but became a permanent team member at the end of the season two opening episode, "See No Evil". Often called "Probie" by DiNozzo, despite no longer being a probationary. Under the pseudonym Thom E. Gemcity he is also the author of a best-selling book using characters based on members of the team.Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen; seasons 1present) replaced Gerald Jackson as the assistant to Dr. Mallard. Originally credited in a recurring role, Dietzen has been credited as "Also Starring" since season six. He is promoted to series regular for the tenth season.[4]Leon Vance (Rocky Carroll) became Director of NCIS following Jenny Shepard's death at the end of the season five. He was formerly NCIS Assistant Director.Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard (David McCallum) is Chief Medical Examiner assigned working at the NCIS headquarters. He spent some time as a medical examiner in Vietnam, Bosnia, and Afghanistan before working for NCIS. He was close friends with Jenny Shepard and is best friends with Gibbs.Caitlin "Kate" Todd (Sasha Alexander) was a Special Agent of the Major Case Response Team for seasons one and two. Initially working as a United States Secret Service agent, she was offered a job at NCIS by Gibbs. She was killed in the season two finale, "Twilight", after being shot in the head by double agent Ari Haswari (Ziva David's half-brother).Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) was director of NCIS for seasons three to five and formerly Gibbs' partner (and lover). She was killed in the season five finale, "Judgment Day", at a deserted restaurant in the middle of a desert.Tobias Fornell, portrayed by Joe Spano (seasons 1present), is a senior FBI Special Agent. He has a daughter with his ex-wife, who was previously married to Gibbs. Gibbs and Fornell have a spiky camaraderie and frequently have meetings in a stopped elevator while pretending to their respective staffs they are furiously arguing. In fact, after sharing a somewhat adversarial relationship early on, the two now share a close friendship.Mike Franks, portrayed by Muse Watson (seasons 38), was a retired special agent with NIS and long-time mentor to Gibbs, whom he still calls Probie. He is also close friends with DiNozzo and Jenny Shepard. He loses his trigger finger in "Rule Fifty-one" but claims that he "can still pull the trigger with [his] thumb." In the season eight episode "Swan Song," he is murdered with a scalpel by Lt. Jonas Cobb, the "Port to Port Killer", though he appears in the episode as a ghost-like figure who interacts with Gibbs in Gibbs' memories as he recalls the events leading up to Franks' murder. In the season nine episode "Life Before His Eyes" Franks appears in Gibbs' hallucination.Trent Kort, portrayed by David Dayan Fisher (seasons 48), is an undercover CIA special agent who always seems to have his own devious goals to pursue. Gibbs regards him as very dangerous and does not trust him. While trying to clean up the agency's mess involving the "Port-to-Port Killer ", Lt. Jonas Cobb, he loses his left eye in a fight with Cobb. After Cobb is taken care of, Ziva's boyfriend, CIA Agent Ray Cruz, is ordered to "handle" Kort in Tel Aviv.Eli David, portrayed by Michael Nouri (seasons 6present), is the director of the national intelligence agency of Israel, the Mossad. He is also father of both NCIS (and ex-Mossad) Agent Ziva David and rogue Mossad double agent Ari Haswari. Even though David does not support his daughter working at NCIS, he claims he nevertheless loves her. David is close friends with, and mentor to, Director Vance, during Vance's first assignment for what was then the NIS.Anthony DiNozzo, Sr., portrayed by Robert Wagner (seasons 7-present), is the father of NCIS agent Tony DiNozzo. He is depicted as something of a con artist who is perpetually short of funds; Sr and Jr are initially estranged but reestablish a relationship in Season 8.Jackson Gibbs, portrayed by Ralph Waite (seasons 6present) is the father of NCIS agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs.E. J. Barrett, portrayed by Sarah Jane Morris (season 89), is a Special Agent with NCIS and formerly a team leader. She investigated the "Port to Port Killer" case in season eight, disappearing for a year after the conclusion of the case and the deaths of her team members. She reappeared after a year on the run from the "Phantom Eight". She is a love interest of DiNozzo's throughout season eight and part of season nine, and remains good friends with DiNozzo after her reappearance.Ned Dorneget, portrayed by Matt L. Jones (season 9), a young probationary agent who works with Gibbs' team. He is used by a home grown terrorist named Harper Dearing (Richard Schiff) who is getting revenge on NCIS. Dearing pays a dentist to place a listening device inside one of Dorneget's fillings.Ray Cruz, portrayed by Enrique Murciano (season 89) is Ziva's ex-boyfriend. He is mentioned frequently by her prior to his first appearance in "Two-Faced"; he works for the CIA, and is thus nicknamed "C-I-Ray" by DiNozzo. He is Special Agent Barrett's contact on the investigation into the Port-to-Port killer, something he withheld from Ziva, and which prompts her to leave him, albeit temporarily.

The Mentalist is an American police procedural television series that debuted on September 23, 2008, on CBS.[1] The show was created by Bruno Heller, who is also its executive producer. The show follows former "psychic" Patrick Jane (Simon Baker), who is now a consultant to the fictional California Bureau of Investigation (CBI), using the highly developed observational skills he previously employed to "read" peoples' minds. The Mentalist was released on iTunes on October 1, 2012.[citation needed]On March 14, 2012, CBS announced that The Mentalist had been renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on September 30, 2012.[2]The Mentalist follows Patrick Jane, an independent consultant for the fictional California Bureau of Investigation (CBI) based in Sacramento, California. Although not an officer of the law of any sort, he uses skills from his former career as a successful, yet knowingly and admittedly fraudulent psychic medium to help a team of CBI agents solve various crimes. The ultimate goal of Patrick Jane and his cooperation with the CBI is to track down the killer known as "Red John" who was responsible for the brutal murders of Patrick's wife and daughter.Patrick Jane formerly had a lucrative career as a con man, successfully posing as a psychic medium and enjoying near-celebrity status. He appeared on television to claim that his paranormal abilities helped the police profile a serial killer named Red John. Red John, angered by the perceived slight, murdered Jane's wife and young daughter in revenge. Jane subsequently abandoned his job as a psychic and teamed with the CBI, using his skills to help them solve various crimes. His main focus is on the cases involving Red John or Red John copycats. He admits to faking the supernatural aspects of his skills, often asserting that "there's no such thing as psychics," yet he has finely honed skills in cold reading, hypnotism, and pickpocketing, as well as powerful observational skill and a deep insight into the human psyche and behavior. These skills come in handy in every episode, but his unorthodox and bizarre techniques to solve crimes sometimes offend the team of agents with whom he works.The show often sets episodes in fictional locales with names like Salinger Mill and Rancho Rosa. Like the majority of American television shows, The Mentalist is mostly filmed within the studio zone in Los Angeles County, but occasionally films a few scenes on location in Sacramento.On October 15, 2008, CBS ordered a full (the first) season of The Mentalist.[3] On May 20, 2009, CBS renewed The Mentalist for a second season, which premiered on September 24, 2009, in the US[4] and on September 22 on CTV in Canada,[5] as well as September 28, 2009, in Australia. On May 19, 2010, CBS announced that The Mentalist was renewed for a third season.[6] On May 18, 2011, the show was officially renewed for a fourth season, and on March 14, 2012, CBS renewed the show for a fifth season.Warner Home Video has released the first three seasons on DVD in Regions 1, 2, and 4. Season 4 will be released on September 18, 2012[7] in Region 1, October 8, 2012[8] in Region 2 and on October 31, 2012 in Region 4.[9]The pilot episode had an audience of 15.6 million viewers in its first airing, and 7.8 million in a re-airing three days later.[18] The December 2, 2008, episode ("Flame Red") was the highest-rated television show of the week, marking the first time a program in its first season had achieved that distinction since Desperate Housewives four years earlier.[19]The show has been criticized as being a rip-off of Psych.[20][21]On November 6, 2009, TNT announced that it had obtained exclusive syndication rights for The Mentalist and would begin airing old episodes of the series starting in the fall of 2011.[31] In Greece, the series premiered in 2009 on pay-TV service NovaCinema 1, the first season premiered in February 7, 2011 on Star Channel, and so far season 2 has been broadcast. In India, The Mentalist premiered on November 2010 on Zee Cafe and was re-aired from May 14, 2012 (Season 1 to Season 4).The Mentalist at TV.com1 Synopsis2 Production3 Cast and characters

His backstory is that he spent his childhood in traveling carnivals with his mean-spirited con-man father who taught him to see all outsiders as marks. He met his wife, Angela, who was also a carny, and together they left the carnival life. Honing the skills his father taught him, Jane became a successful psychic and medium. Red John murdered Angela and their daughter Charlotte in retaliation for Jane's televised challenge. Jane now works as a criminal consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation. Jane has started to develop close friendships with his colleagues, especially his boss, Senior Special Agent Teresa Lisbon. He usually presents his jocular, teasing face, but he shows his darker side when dealing with Red John. At those times, Jane becomes intense, focused, and willing to go to great lengths to capture and even kill him. He owns a classic French car, a robin egg blue Citron DS. As an avid tea drinker, he shows a certain liking to lapsang souchong at multiple occasions.Robin Tunney as Senior Special Agent Teresa Lisbona senior special agent with the CBI and leader of the Serious Crime Unit of which Patrick is part. Though Patrick often annoys her with his unusual behavior and going behind her back, she views him as a valuable member of the team and will almost always back him up. Her mother was killed in a drunk driving accident, leaving her to care for her brothers and her abusive alcoholic father. She is the only member of the team Patrick trusts with details of his past and they work well together, though his attitude often causes trouble for her. Her team is responsible for the Red John case, although the responsibility for catching Red John was taken over briefly by Sam Bosco, her mentor when she was a junior agent, until he and his team were murdered by one of Red John's operatives. Although there has never been a demonstrated romantic link between Jane and Lisbon in any episode, the writers have not eliminated it as a plausible possible development for future episodes. At the very least she is one of the few people that Jane truly cares about, and she is seen from time to time affected by his charm.Tim Kang as Special Agent Kimball Choa special agent with the CBI and a member of Lisbon's Serious Crime Unit. Cho has a dry, deadpan sense of humor and is good friends with Rigsby. He is often the one who sees through Patrick's parlor tricks (when Patrick tells Van Pelt that he was moving a straw across the table with telekinesis, Cho simply says, "He blew on it"). He was secretly called Ernie by the Bosco team, who also refer to Rigsby as Bert; Cho claims not to mind, as "Ernie's the clever, handsome one." He was a member of a street gang, the Avon Park Playboys, garnering a juvenile record, which is sealed. He also spent time in juvenile hall, until leaving to serve in the U.S. Army Special Forces, before becoming a police officer and then joining the CBI. Because of his difficult childhood, Cho often befriends kids who have committed crimes, possibly because they remind him of himself at that age.Owain Yeoman as Special Agent Wayne Rigsbya special agent with the CBI and a member of Lisbon's Serious Crime Unit, serving as an arson specialist. He served two years as a San Diego arson investigator before joining CBI. He developed strong feelings for Van Pelt. He didn't initially act on them, as romance between agents is against regulations, but ultimately the two gave in to their feelings and began seeing each other secretly. Their relationship ultimately became public knowledge, and so an ultimatum was issued to them by Madeleine Hightower to end their relationship, which they did to protect both of their careers. They remain friends and colleagues, despite the awkwardness of the working environment. Rigsby's father is a former career criminal who used to be part of a notorious biker gang. To save his father from going back to jail for parole violations, Rigsby lies to his father's parole officer. This forces Cho to lie to SPU during an investigation into the murder of cop killer Todd Johnson while in CBI custody.Amanda Righetti as Special Agent Grace Van Pelta special agent with the CBI and a member of Lisbon's Serious Crime Unit, serving as its newest member, often doing research for other members. She has a deep belief in religion and psychics and will butt heads with Patrick when he dismisses it or does something morally inappropriate. Van Pelt became secretly involved with Rigsby after months of reluctance owing to the regulations prohibiting romantic relationships between agents (although Jane has always known about it, thanks to his superpowersin fact, he even encouraged Rigsby and Van Pelt to act on their desires before they proceeded to second base). She is subdued and very organized, which leads Jane to deduce during the first season that this is because she is hiding some deep emotional trauma. She was engaged to FBI Agent Craig O'Laughlin, whom she killed after he revealed himself as one of Red John's accomplices.Red Johna nickname for the show's leading antagonist. He is a serial killer thought to have murdered at least 28 people, including Patrick Jane's wife and daughter, five years before the pilot episode. Red John often taunts Jane, and saved Jane's life when he was about to be killed by Red John copycats; he parted from Jane on that occasion by quoting the opening stanza of "The Tyger" by William Blake. His crimes and "associates" are portrayed in every season of the series, although the character has been seen fully on screen only once, disguised for complete anonymity.[citation needed] Locating and killing Red John is Jane's primary motivation for assisting the CBI.Gregory Itzin as Supervising Agent Virgil Minellithe former special agent in charge of the CBI until the Season 2 episode "His Red Right Hand." Minelli was an effective team leader, yet appeared fatigued and exhausted from years of political battles with his subordinates and his superiors. Nevertheless, he behaved in a paternal and friendly way to Lisbon's team. Minelli is finally pushed to his breaking point following the murders of Sam Bosco and his team by Rebecca, their secretary and a member of Red John's network; these were the first agents ever to die under his command. As a result, Minelli retired to a quiet life as a fisherman and was replaced by Madeleine Hightower. In the Season 3 episode "Jolly Red Elf," Minelli is approached by Patrick for support in Patrick's investigation into Red John's network, and Minelli ultimately agrees to help him.Aunjanue Ellis as Supervising Agent Madeleine Hightowerthe former special agent in charge of the CBI. In the Season 2 episode "The Red Box," Hightower arrives to take command, replacing Virgil Minelli. She is very much in command of the team and is one of the few people to have a hold on Patrick Jane. Despite adopting a hard-nosed by-the-book approach to managing the CBI, and her own skill as an administrator, she maintains an efficient and friendly relationship with the team. She also respects and sees Jane as valuable to the CBI and its future, and seems to understand Patrick's focus on finding Red John. Hightower is in the middle of a divorce and has two children. In Season 3, Hightower is among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and is considered a prime suspect owing to her previous relationship with one of Johnson's victims; this, along with evidence planted at the scene of the murder of Johnson's accomplice, Manuel Montero, ultimately leaves Hightower a wanted fugitive. Jane realizes Hightower was framed by Red John's accomplice, the true killer, and helps her escape; he then works throughout Season 3 to identify the true CBI mole. In the Season 3 finale, Hightower resurfaces, realizing Red John is closing in, and works with Jane and the team to expose the moleFBI agent Craig O'Laughlin; who is shot and killed by Hightower and Van Pelt in a showdown at Hightower's hideout.Pruitt Taylor Vince as Special Agent/Supervising Agent J.J. LaRochethe head of CBI's Internal Affairs. He arrives in the Season 3 episode "Jolly Red Elf," appointed the new head of the CBI's Professional Standards Unit. Following the demise of a member of Red John's network, Todd Johnson, while in custody at the CBI, LaRoche had been brought in to question the team after Johnson's death appeared to be an inside job. He is quirky, charmless, professional, socially awkward and Patrick's intellectual equal. But despite his "Robo-Cop" act, he has been shown to be a relatively normal person when not directly engaged in his job, dropping the veneer when he is around Jane. LaRoche initially considered Jane his prime suspect, but ultimately named Agent Hightower as the killer owing to evidence planted by Red John's mole, who was the true killer. With Hightower a fugitive, LaRoche was appointed to take over Hightower's duties as the team's supervisor and Jane's boss. LaRoche quickly asserted his command when he briefly removed Lisbon and replaced her with Cho, promoting him to team leader, but later reappointed Lisbon as team leader (after commending Cho's stint as acting leader, in Cho's file) and makes it very clear that he had removed Lisbon to show he would not tolerate any disrespect. In the Season 3 finale, Jane blackmailed LaRoche into handing over the suspect list by threatening to reveal LaRoche's dark secret; Jane later admits he has absolutely no idea what LaRoche's dark secret is, "but it must be horrible." In Season 4, LaRoche revealed to Lisbon that he is leaving his temporary assignment with the CBI Major Crimes Unit and is returning to Professional Services. LaRoche states his time working with Lisbon and Jane has been "interesting" and then awkwardly hugs Lisbon, who wishes him luck. LaRoche returns in season 5's "Blood Feud" to investigate Rigsby shooting a gang leader who had caused the death of Rigsby's father. LaRoche decides that officially Rigsby acted as part of his job but makes it clear he believes Jane manipulated events so Rigsby could take revenge for his father.Michael Rady as Supervising Agent Luther WainwrightIn the season 4 episode "Ring Around the Rosie," Wainwright takes command of Lisbon's team. He is shown to be quite young and intelligent, but also arrogant. Later episodes show Wainwright being mellow and generally not taking a very active role in Lisbon's cases, other than giving the team deadlines or incentives for the high-profile ones. In the Season 4 finale, "The Crimson Hat," Wainwright is the tragic victim of one of Red John's most dastardly plots to date. Red John lures Jane out to an empty lot. Jane is followed by the CBI team, and they are unknowingly followed by the FBI. When the car supposedly containing Red John tries to escape, FBI agents shoot and kill both the driver and the backseat passenger (thought to be Red John). When they open the door to remove him, they find they have actually shot Wainwright, tied up and gagged, with a speaker around his neck to transmit Red John's voice.Michael Gaston as director of CBI Gale Bertram; the bureau director of the entire California Bureau of Investigation, first appointed in the Season 3 premiere "Red Sky at Night." Bertram appears to be mostly concerned with politics and the media, but has been shown to be well aware of Lisbon's team and her effectiveness at closing cases and has a high regard for Jane's productiveness and worth as a CBI asset. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed that Bertram was among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed Bertram was the killer, FBI agent Craig O'Laughlin was revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer. In Season 4, Bertram suspends Lisbon and her team in retaliation. Throughout his appearances, there have been minor indications that he is connected to Red John, most notably when, in the Season 3 episode "Red Queen," he refers to a poem of William Blake, a poet whom Red John had also referenced personally to Patrick Jane, and again in the Season 4 premiere, Bertram secretly directs District Attorney Ardiles to lead the prosecution against Jane at his murder trial, after suspending Lisbon and her team.Catherine Dent as Susan Darcy, an FBI agent assigned to the Panzer case in season 4 episode "Blinking Red Light." In "Always Bet on Red" she quickly becomes suspicious of Jane's claim that Red John is dead. He is in fact alive, something Jane doesn't want Darcy to find out, as Red John would kill her for having such knowledge. In the episode "Cheap Burgundy," Darcy asked Jane to assist her with a case she was investigating, but during the investigation she kept trying to confirm that Red John was alive, but Jane kept denying it. During one such conversation, it was confirmed that Susan lost a sister to drowning and that she blamed herself for what happened. At the end of the episode, Jane reluctantly admitted that Red John was alive. Darcy accused Jane of being one of Red John's friends and disciples, and finally tells Wainwright she is going to "bring (Jane) down."Rebecca Wisocky as Brenda Shettrick, the head of the CBI's Media Relations Unitshe is entirely concerned with liaising with the media and leading outreach programs and other efforts to the public; she appears to have good relations with the team and senior agents. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed that Shettrick was among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed that CBI director Gale Bertram was the killer, FBI agent Craig O'Laughlin was ultimately revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer.David Norona as Osvaldo Ardiles, an assistant district attorney who quickly proves to be an enemy of the team when he tries to convict an innocent man of armed robbery in an effort to get information on a powerful Mafia group. Cho, realizing Ardiles' plan would never work, and that Ardiles himself was not going to listen to Cho, proved the man's innocence. Ardiles, furious, retaliated by cutting off all support from the D.A.'s office to the team. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed that Ardiles was among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed that CBI director Gale Bertram was the killer, FBI agent Craig O'Laughlin was ultimately revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer. In the Season 4 premiere, Ardiles, at Bertram's direction, tries to charge Jane with killing Timothy Carter, but in the end Jane was cleared of all charges, and Ardiles lost the case.Leslie Hope as Kristina Fryean alleged psychic who has occasionally worked with the CBI. When they first met, she and Patrick were at odds. Patrick believes she is a fake, owing to his own awareness that psychics do not exist. Later, he becomes emotional after Frye states to Patrick that she has spoken with his dead wife about their daughter's final moments. As time goes by, Kristina helps out with more murder cases, and romantic sparks start to fly between her and Patrick. In the Season 2 finale, Kristina is put under protection by the CBI when she attempts to reach out to Red John, andas Patrick had fearedKristina later disappears from her heavily guarded home. In the Season 3 episode "Blood on His Hands," Kristina is found alive but unresponsive, after four months of being missing, through a tipoff from Visualize leader Brett Stiles. After Jane attempts to communicate with her in a sance, she tells him that she is dead, which Jane denies. She appears to be at peace, wryly teasing Jane. She is unaware of the circumstances of her disappearance and cannot or will not provide any information of value to Jane. She is, to date, catatonic and presumably institutionalized.Terry Kinney as Sam Boscoa senior special agent with the CBI and another team leader. He was Lisbon's mentor when she was a junior agent, and despite being married, he shared strong romantic feelings for her until he died. When Bosco became an investigative team leader in the new Serial Crimes Unit, Virgil Minelli gave Bosco the responsibility for catching Red John. He was Patrick Jane's office nemesisbased on a lack of trust, they had an antagonistic relationship. Patrick didn't trust Bosco to properly investigate the Red John case, and Bosco viewed Jane as untrustworthy and unreliable. In the Season 2 episode "His Red Right Hand," Bosco's team was murdered by Rebecca, their secretary and a member of Red John's network. Rebecca confirms to Jane that Red John ordered the murders because he knows that Jane wants the case. Only Bosco lived long enough to arrive alive, but in critical condition, at the hospital. Shortly before he died Bosco made peace with Patrick, who confirmed to Bosco that he would kill Red John.Eric Winter as FBI agent Craig O'Laughlina special agent in charge who first meets (through a car crash) the CBI team while jointly investigating Visualize. O'Laughlin catches the attention of Van Pelt, and the two of them have instant chemistry. Over time, their romance deepens; in the episode "Blood for Blood," O'Laughlin asks her to marry him and she agrees, much to Rigsby's displeasure. He is shown to have seniority, technical expertise, high intelligence and combat skill. His past before joining the FBI includes his being a National Football League player who knew (and fondly remembers) Van Pelt's father, and a learned traveler of the Far East. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed O'Laughlin is among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed CBI director Gale Bertram was the killer, O'Laughlin was revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer. In a showdown at Hightower's hideout, O'Laughlin shot and wounded Lisbon and made it clear he was Red John's accomplice. A wounded Lisbon musters enough strength to throw and hit O'Laughlin with a sofa pillow. While O'Laughlin is distracted for the split second by getting hit with the sofa pillow, Van Pelt and Hightower draw their firearms and shoot O'Laughlin, fatally wounding him.Bradley Whitford as Fake Red John/Timothy Cartera child abductor and one of Red John's accomplices. He kidnapped a young girl named Debbi Lupin and kept her locked up in his basement with his wife as an accomplice.

Timothy is sitting in the food court near Jane and answers his phone. Jane, seeing this, has Lisbon tell him what the person she called said to her. It is the same thing that Timothy in the food court said, so Jane confronts him. Timothy first denies it, but moments later drops hints that he is Red John, keeping Jane at a safe distance by subtly pointing a revolver hidden inside a folded newspaper at him. Jane, however, is still skeptical, and confronts the man again as he tries to leave, only for him to reveal to Jane details of the murders of his wife and daughter, specifically, what they smelled like. This sends Jane over the edge; he calls after the man and then guns him down with a weapon hidden in his coat pocket. Jane then sits down and calmly sips tea while waiting to be arrested, apparently satisfied that this man was indeed Red John. In the Season 4 premiere, it is revealed that Timothy Carter is not really Red John after all, after Jane tricks Carter's wife into revealing that they had kidnapped Debbi. In the Season 4 episode "Little Red Book," Patrick takes Rosalind Harker, Red John's blind ex-girlfriend, to the morgue where Carter's body is stored, and has her feel its face to check if she recognizes him. After doing so, Rosalind confirms Patrick's suspicionsCarter was not the man who identified himself as "Roy Tagliaferro" (one of Red John's aliases).Jillian Bach as Sarah Harrigana public defender whom the team first meet in the Season 3 episode "Every Rose Has Its Thorn," where she is a client at a matchmaking service. Her interest is piqued by Rigsby during an interview regarding an alibi she provides to a suspect, after which she asks him out on a date, which he accepts. She and Rigsby continue their relationship during season 4, where she is assigned as the legal counsel for a suspect the team are interviewing in one episode. During another episode, she assists Rigsby with his upcoming testimony for a case that has gone to trial, before they consummate their relationship. She announces in "My Bloody Valentine" that she is pregnant. In "Black Cherry" it is revealed that Sarah is now an ADA with DA's office.Samaire Armstrong as Summer Edgecombe a prostitute recruited by Cho as a confidential informant in Season 4.

He is proven innocent but does not appreciate Jane's insults and threatens physical harm or worse if they meet again. They apparently reconcile by the Season 3 episode "Redacted," as Jane hires him to steal Agent LaRoche's Todd Johnson murder suspect list from LaRoche's home. Culpepper fails to find it and gets caught. He tells Jane that if Jane does not get the charges dropped, Culpepper will tell CBI what he was doing. Lisbon gets the charges dropped by punching Culpepper in the face. In the Season 3 finale, Jane admits to having hired Culpepper, telling this directly to LaRoche, but avoids punishment by threatening to reveal LaRoche's dark secret, which Jane claims Culpepper discovered while searching through LaRoche's safe, then revealed to Jane while in custody. Jane later admits that Culpepper learned nothing about LaRoche's secret.Alicia Witt as Rosalind Harkera blind woman, Rosalind had a relationship with Red John, who called himself by the alias Roy Tagliaferro. According to her, his car broke down near her home and she wound up spending the next few months in a relationship with him. He left her without saying goodbye, though he did draw one of his smiley faces on a wall in her house. In the Season 1 finale episode "Red John's Footsteps," Patrick and Lisbon find her and get a description of Red John. In the end of Season 4 episode "Little Red Book," Patrick contacts Rosalind and brings her to a morgue where the body of Timothy Carter, one of Red John's accomplices who had manipulated Patrick into killing him by pretending to be Red John himself, was kept. He has her feel Carter's face to see if she can identify him. She tells him that she has never meet the man before, confirming Patrick's suspicions that Red John is still alive.Currie Graham as Walter Mashburna highly successful billionaire businessman. He first appears in the Season 2 episode "Redline" as a murder suspect, but is cleared by Patrick, for whom he has quickly grown respect. This respect deepens in the Season 3 episode "Red Hot," where Mashburn is saved from assassination attempts, and along the way develops a (brief) romance with Lisbon.Jack Plotnick as Brett Partridgea CBI forensic specialist who has appeared in two episodes. He is very minor and is not named on screen. Jane states Brett "loves his job a bit too much" and calls him a ghoul.David Paymer as James Panzera serial killer known as the San Joaquin Killer who appeared in the Season 4 episode "Blinking Red Light." James Panzer pretended to be a blogger devoting his life to find a serial killer known as the San Joaquin Killer (SJK). SJK killed at least five young women, ranging in age from 16 to 20, two of which murders were seen in the episode. In actuality, however, Panzer was the San Joaquin Killer himself. Patrick Jane suspected Panzer of being SJK. Jane's suspicions were borne out when he and Panzer both appeared on Karen Cross's television show discussing the SJK case. During the show, Jane goaded Panzer into comparing Red John unfavorably with SJK. Panzer rose to the bait, saying that the SJK killings were the work of a genius and Red John by comparison was a "common sociopath, lazy, sloppy, delusional," and becoming so absorbed in building up SJK's image that he was unaware that he was making the same mistake that Patrick Jane and Kristina Frye had made: namely, belittling Red John in a public forum. Shortly after the television appearance, Panzer was found murdered in an alleyway, with Red John's smiley face painted in blood on the wall near his body. Panzer's murder proved Jane's theory that Red John is still alive.Shauna Bloom as Rebeccaan assistant on Sam Bosco's team at CBI, and one of Red John's accomplices. Rebecca's past has not been fully revealed, but some details are known. According to Patrick Jane, she had an unhappy childhood and was molested by a close relative. The molestation led to her developing a strong sense of self-loathing, which manifested itself as self-abuse and self-medication. In the Season 2 episode "His Red Right Hand," Rebecca killed Bosco and two other agentsunder orders from Red Johnso that Lisbon's team, and Patrick, would be given the case back. Also under Red John's orders, and using the alias Agent Rojo (Spanish for "red"), she stole a body and evidence that could have brought Lisbon's team closer to identifying Red John. Rebecca was killed (by poison), very likely by Red John himself (disguised as a guard), in CBI.Malcolm McDowell as Bret Stilesthe leader of the Visualize Self-Realization Center church. Stiles is an ambiguous church leader who is charismatic, smooth, and skilled. He has succeeded in deflecting investigations from the authorities on numerous occasions and has hinted to Patrick that he has inside knowledge about Red John. On their last meeting, Bret provided information that led to Jane and the CBI recovering Kristina Frye alive (but catatonic). Soon afterward, Bret left to open a Visualize center in Jakarta, with his representatives claiming not to know when he might return. Stiles does return in the fourth season episode "His Thoughts Were Red Thoughts," and is charged with murdering an anticult activist. However, Jane helps prove Stiles's innocence, leading Stiles to say that he owes Jane a favor.eljko Ivanek as Dr. Linus Wagnera partner of the victim in "Pilot" episode, where double homicide which looks as though it may have been committed by the serial killer Red John. At the end of the episode it is revealed that Dr. Wagner himself is a copycat of Red John, and is the true killer.On January 7, 2009, the show won the award for "Favorite New TV Drama" at the 35th People's Choice Awards.[22]Simon Baker received a nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the 2009 Emmy Awards.[23]The series has been nominated for The International TV Dagger at the 2009 Crime Thriller Awards, an awards ceremony presented by the British Crime Writers' Association.[24]Simon Baker received a nomination for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor  Television Series Drama at the 67th Golden Globe Awards.Simon Baker received a nomination for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards.[25]On August 21, 2010, The Mentalist was honored with an award for its scientific and critical thinking content, from The IIG during its 10th Anniversary Gala.

Leverage is an American television drama series on TNT that premiered in December 2008.[1] The series is produced by director/executive producer Dean Devlin's production company Electric Entertainment. Leverage follows a five-person team: a thief, a grifter, a hacker, and a retrieval specialist, led by former insurance investigator Nathan Ford, who use their skills to fight corporate and governmental injustices inflicted on ordinary citizens.Season 1 consists of thirteen episodes, which writers John Rogers and Chris Downey and producer Dean Devlin intended to be a complete story should the series not be renewed. Season 2, for which production moved from Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon,[2] ran in two parts: a nine-episode summer season that premiered on July 15, 2009, followed by a further six episodes the following winter. Leverage moved to Sunday for Season 3, which began June 20, 2010.[3]Leverage was renewed for a fourth season in July 2010.[4] It premiered on June 26, 2011,[5] and ran for 18 episodes, ten in the summer and eight in the winter. The continuation of Season 4 began on Sunday November 27, 2011, at 9pm EST on TNT.[6]On August 12, 2011, Leverage was renewed for a fifth season,[7] to be both filmed and set in Portland, Oregon.[8] Season 5 premiered July 15, 2012.[9]Nathan Ford is a former insurance investigator with an intricate knowledge of scams. He and his team act as modern-day Robin Hoods, staging elaborate cons for clients victimized by an individual or corporation with the wealth and influence to avoid reprisal within the legal system.The team comes together when Victor Dubenich, a wealthy aerospace executive, persuades Ford to lead a team of talented criminals to steal back aeronautical plans allegedly stolen from him by a competitor. After a successful heist, Dubenich double-crosses them, withdrawing their payment and attempting to blow them up in an abandoned warehouse. In retaliation, the group decides to run a con on Victor, eventually exposing his corruption and implicating him in a bribery attempt, which leads to his being arrested by the FBI. When the con is complete, rather than retire, they decide to keep working for the thrill each gets doing the work they are best at, and the added bonus of how effective they are as part of an elite team. Ford's condition for continuing is that he is allowed to select their jobs, steering them from crimes engaged in for pure profit to jobs undertaken to benefit those with a genuine need who cannot use the legal system or other "legitimate" methods to redress their grievances. Underpinning the main plot are two relationships: Nate and Sophie, whose complicated romantic relationship dates back to his days as an insurance investigator, and Parker and Hardison, whose nascent romance plays out tentatively, as they learn how to build a relationship.The team sets up headquarters in Los Angeles, operating as Leverage Consulting & Associates, and for a time operate free of scrutiny until the arrival of Nate's former competitor, James Sterling. With Sterling determined to take them down, they pull their most daring heist by stealing a maquette from Nate's former boss, Ian Blackpoole. Nate's revenge comes at a cost, and the team must disband for six months. It re-forms in Boston, Nate's hometown, where they resume their activities, still followed by Sterling. Season two ends with the team still intact but physically separated from Ford, who surrenders to Sterling and the FBI rather than allow the team to be arrested.As season three begins, Ford is in prison, while the team attempts to find a way to get him out, until fate intervenes in the form of a mysterious Italian woman who aids in Nate's escape. She blackmails the team into taking down infamous and untouchable criminal figure Damien Moreau. By season's end, the team finally brings down Moreau's empire, and he is left imprisoned in San Lorenzo, a fictional European nation he once controlled until the team ousted the puppet regime leader.Season four opens only days after their return from San Lorenzo, the team discovering that someone has been bugging their headquarters. They assume one of the many influential people they've brought down is now out for payback. Nate discovers that its really the work of a wealthy businessman named Jack Latimer. Latimer has been tracking the team's movements since their formation in Chicago, and has found a way to profit off their good deeds. With every major company they bring down, he invests in their competitors and makes a fortune, having built a multibillion-dollar empire in the short span of their operations; now he offers to give the team intel on the evildoings of other major corporations, if they alert him in advance and give him the chance to profit on each company's downfall. Nate, however, does not trust Latimer and refuses to associate himself and his team with Latimer, and his suspicions prove to be justified when it is revealed that Latimer is secretly working with Victor Dubenich (the team's first victim), who is out to not only rebuild his fortune but also destroy the team.Season Five opens with the team having moved to Portland, Oregon and setting up shop in a microbrewery.Most episodes follow a set story structure: After meeting the client, the Leverage team researches the villains to find a weakness to exploit as part of their con. Each con, either as originally planned or as complications develop, typically requires the specialized skills of all the members of the group. Towards the end of each episode, the villains seem to get the upper hand, only to be outwitted by the Leverage team. Because most of the narrative has seemed to follow the Leverage team's point of view, the audience is momentarily uninformed as to exactly how the Leverage team has succeeded in their con. A flashback then reveals how a seeming complication was either anticipated by the Leverage team, or utilized in a clever improvisation. These flashbacks, which feature in every episode, sometimes reveal only in retrospect that an earlier scene was actually a clue to the Leverage team's plan. More often, however, the flashbacks reveal new information the viewer has not been privy to. This formula is followed by every episode in seasons one, two, and three. Each season ends with a two-part season finale which involves a two-part, multi-stage con designed to bring down a major adversary, such as an international crime financier in season three, with an ending that advances the team's story into the new season.Leverage is shot using Red One video cameras. Extensive use of Steadicam helps the audience participate in the scene. All of the dailies are shipped on hard drives to Electric Entertainment in Hollywood, California.[11] Shooting, editing, and all post-production work are done digitally, using no physical film or videotape at any point in the process. Leverage was originally edited in Apple's Final Cut Studio Pro 7, but has used Final Cut Pro X in the most recent seasons.[12][11]Shooting is in 4096 x 2304 at 24 frame/s, though resolution is reduced in post production to 1080p.Thirteen episodes were commissioned for the first season.[13] The show's pilot was filmed on-location in Chicago, with the remainder of the first season set and filmed in Los Angeles. Since the second season, the show has been primarily set in Boston, but filmed in Portland, Oregon whereas of Season 5 the team has moved operations. Executive producer Dean Devlin has announced that the fifth season will not only be shot in Portland, but will be set there as well.[14]The series premiered on December 7, 2008 on TNT in the United States.In the United Kingdom the series aired on Bravo where it premiered on January 20, 2010; when Bravo closed down, it was picked up by the FXUK.[15][16]The series started broadcasting January 7, 2009 on W Channel in Australia.[citation needed]ION TV announced that Leverage will become part of their 2012 broadcast in syndication.

The son of South Boston numbers runner Jimmy Ford,[10] Nate originally intended to become a Catholic priest prior to becoming an insurance investigator. While Ford was working for IYS, Blackpoole decided on a policy of denying every medical treatment especially those experimental(Blackpoole claimed the policy was implemented to cut costs, but in fact to turn a bigger profit), his young son Sam became fatally ill and IYS refused to pay for an experimental procedure, resulting in his death. The aftermath led to Nate's divorce from his wife Maggie, his subsequent dismissal from the company and his descent into alcoholism. Ford swore vengeance on Blackpoole and IYS which would come to pass years later. After meeting the team for the first time and running a con against their first mark, instead of disbanding as intended, Nate is asked to continue working with them and is given the privilege of leading the team and selecting what clients the team will help. A skilled planner, Nate draws on his experience as an insurance investigator to anticipate the moves of his team's marks. Nate is at first very affable, but is unwilling to discuss his own problems with friends or others. His tendency to change objectives in the middle of a job, his alcoholism, and his often-tenuous relationship with his team has on occasion put the client and the team at risk. Since moving to Portland, he and Sophie are now an established couple, but he is currently working on a project with Hardison's help which is being kept secret from the other team members.Gina Bellman as Sophie Devereaux ("The Grifter"): British actress and accomplished grifter with a taste for art theft. Multi-lingual and particularly adept at the use of accents, Sophie is seen to portray many characters in various cons, usually making direct contact with a mark to draw them into the con. Sophie has a collection of aliases, which includes "Sophie Devereaux", but her real name remains unknown. Comically, her attempts to make a career as an actress lead to nothing but failure, as she proves woefully untalented and over-the-top onstage. It is only during a con when she can disappear effortlessly into a character, where ironically she can actually act well if she is pretending to be an actress. She has a long history with Nate, dating back at least ten years to when he pursued her with IYS as an art thief. At some point, they recognized an attraction to one another, leaving Sophie alternately frustrated, angry, and disappointed. They have on occasion tried to further the relationship, but for various reasons one or the other resisted; however, as of the beginning of Season 5 she and Nate are now an established couple.Aldis Hodge as Alec Hardison ("The Hacker"): The team's computer specialist and hacker. He is a self-proclaimed geek and science fiction fan, with an easy going manner and dry, unusual wit. Hardison was raised by a foster parent, an older woman he refers to as "Nana". Hardison can hack into most forms of electronics and is rarely caught. Hardison designed and assembled the computer and television systems in the team's headquarters, and is responsible for the two-way earpieces used by the team on each episode. He is also very attached to his electronics (and in particular his van) and shown to become very depressed when the con takes a turn for the worse and requires they destroy his electronics to make their escape. Hardison and Parker have a developing romantic relationship but it is fraught with personal complications.Christian Kane as Eliot Spencer ("The Hitter"): The team's highly skilled martial artist, weapons expert and self-described "retrieval expert". A former soldier in the United States Army, his role in cons is often to play small roles while protecting the team, often leading him into hand-to-hand combat that draws on his martial arts skills. Eliot once worked for crime financier Damien Moreau, and has a long history as a hired gun and bodyguard, then a retrieval specialist. Eliot has proficiency with firearms, but dislikes guns. While merely presumed as the muscleman, he demonstrates a subtle intelligence in conversation, often taking advantage of the underestimations of others and later in the series performs as a grifter along with Sophie. In contrast to the other characters Eliot prefers to keep his romantic life private, as well as much of his background. In the course of the series, he has displayed an extraordinary talent for cooking, and is now in charge of the kitchen of the microbrewery in Portland where the team has set up headquarters (despite clashes on the subject with Hardison).Beth Riesgraf as Parker ("The Thief"): An expert thief, cat-burglar, pickpocket and safe-cracker. The product of an abusive childhood spent in several foster homes, Parker is socially awkward and relates poorly to most people but has come to regard the other members of the team as her family. Sophie (and in Season 5 Elliot) has attempted to improve gaps in her social skills on numerous occasions with limited success. Parker also has affection for Hardison, but finds it hard to convey what she feels when confronted by others. While emotionally impulsive, she can demonstrate great physical self-control in her work using acrobatics, strength and concentration to her advantage. Her obsessive focus on theft is to the point that her safehouse is filled with gear and rappelling equipment to help her in various jobs, and during one con, she was put through a rehab to address it. Parker was trained at a young age by expert thief (and recurring character) Archie Leach, who found her proficient with the physical demands of burglary as well as safe-cracking and lock-picking, skills she uses in many of the cons. In Season 5's "The Broken Wing Job", she proves that she can handle problems on her own while the other team members are away.Mark A. Sheppard as James Sterling: Originally Nate's colleague and rival at IYS, now an Interpol agent. Sterling learns of Nate's new life and begins to follow him, first thinking that Nate wants his job at IYS and later to bring the team to justice. Nate soon realizes Sterling is on his trail, but foils his efforts to dismantle the team's cons. In time, a theft leads Sterling to work with the team on a con, the outcome of which leads to his being offered a position with Interpol. The two remain friendly adversaries however (with the rest of the team and Tara passionately hating him), and Sterling has on several occasions allowed Nate to continue to remain untouched in exchange for Nate and his group helping him catch bad guys. As of Season 5's "The Frame Up Job", he has become the head of a special Interpol art theft/forgery detail (which he created).Jeri Ryan as Tara Cole: A self-assured grifter sent by Sophie to temporarily replace her while she is in Europe taking some personal time. Easily able to adapt to the team's method, she is nonetheless slow to be accepted by the team. Tara is a profit-seeking con who seeks a cut of most of their jobs, but over time learns to understand their not-for-profit motives.Kari Matchett as Maggie Collins: Nate's ex-wife, an art expert who re-enters his life while working with IYS Chair Ian Blackpoole. Although she is no longer in love with him, Maggie still cares for Nate. However, she cannot live with his drinking, which led her to divorce him. She is unaware of IYS's role in her son's death, but learns the whole story as she's drawn into one of Nate's cons, allowing them to come to terms with his death and begin to rebuild their relationship. She demonstrates a flair for Nate's new work, and ends up helping the team complete a con; later the team comes to her rescue when she is falsely accused of theft. She returns to help the team in the fourth season finale, and by then has developed a friendship with Sophie.Rick Overton and Gerald Downey as FBI Special Agents Taggert and McSweeten: Taggert and McSweeten have (unwittingly) worked with Leverage Consulting & Associates on at least four occasions, believing Hardison and Parker to be fellow FBI agents. Credited with major arrests following four of the team's cons, they have risen through the ranks of the bureau rapidly. McSweeten also has a crush on Parker, which makes Hardison (and Taggert) jealous. In Season 5, McSweeten seeks the team's help with a case that obsesses his father.Robert Blanche as Detective Captain Patrick Bonanno: A Massachusetts State Police detective the team tips off when they want a mark to be arrested. An honest cop, Bonanno is seemingly aware of the team's work, and has their respect, but has never attempted to pursue them. Bonanno is a lieutenant in Season Two, but is promoted to captain as Season Three opens and is a regular at Nate's weekly poker games in Season Four.Goran Visnjic as Damien Moreau: Moreau is an international crime financier and illegal goods trader who has thus far been untouchable by international law enforcement. Moreau hides behind a network of people who do his bidding, while living on an isolated island. The team must use the clues and connections they find during their cases to take down his network and bring him to justice while under the watchful eye of a woman known only as "The Italian". Moreau is eventually jailed in the small, politically unstable country of San Lorenzo.Elisabetta Canalis as The Italian: An unnamed Italian woman who blackmails the team into taking down Moreau within six months. If the team fails, she promises to have Nate imprisoned and the rest of the team killed.Wil Wheaton as Colin "Chaos" Mason: an unscrupulous hacker whose skills rival Hardison's. Chaos and Hardison see each other as nemeses, but Chaos has also attempted to kill Sophie and nearly succeeded. He assists the team (for money) in the fourth season finale.Leon Rippy as Jack Latimer: a multi-billion dollar professional investor who has been tracking the team since their first job. He profits from the team by way of betting against the companies that the Leverage crew takes down, thus getting ahead of the market. He has twice attempted to make a deal with Nate; he lets them know of companies that have covered their tracks so well they don't show on the team's radar, and while they take down said companies he will make certain investments from which he will profit. As of "The Lonely Hearts Job", he appears to be working with someone who wants to make war with the Leverage team. In the fourth season finale, he was last seen falling from a very high cliff into a river with the sound of a gunshot being heard.Saul Rubinek as Victor Dubenich: The mark in the pilot episode, he assembled the team for Nate and then double-crossed them, motivating them to unite to destroy his business and get him jailed. At the end of the fourth season, we learn that he is behind Latimer's involvement with the team as part of his plot (from prison) for revenge. He was also last seen falling from a very high cliff into a river in the fourth season finale with the sound of a gunshot being heard.Tom Skerritt as Jimmy Ford: Nate's father, an Irish-American organized criminal from Boston. Nate, after disrupting one of Jimmy's cons, forced him into retirement in Ireland. He returned at the end of the fourth season and was killed by Latimer and Dubenich.Richard Chamberlain as Archie Leach: An expert thief who was a professional mentor and father figure to Parker, he inadvertantly got the team involved in a job when Parker came to his aid and got into trouble, and then returned to aid the team in the fourth season finale. ("Archie Leach" was the real name of actor Cary Grant, who played a master second-story thief in Alfred Hitchcock's iconic 1955 film To Catch a Thief.)Clayne Crawford as Quinn, a professional man of violence who is almost as good as Eliot. He opposes the team in the first season finale and then assists them (for money) in the fourth season finale.Adam Baldwin as Colonel Vance, a United States Army officer tasked with counterterror operations, who was formerly Eliot's commanding officer.

Fry's Electronics is a big-box store and retailer of software, consumer electronics, computer hardware, with in-store computer repair and custom computer building services and household appliances with a chain of superstores headquartered in Silicon Valley. Starting with one store located in Sunnyvale, California, by 2008 the chain posted sales of $2.4 billion and operated 34 stores in nine states.[2]In 1972, Charles Fry sold the Fry's Supermarkets chain for $14 million to Save Mart Supermarkets. He gave a portion of the proceeds (approximately $1 million per son) to each of his sons John, Randy, and Dave, none of whom had much interest in grocery store retailing.[3] Instead, in 1985, they joined together with a fourth partner, Kathryn Kolder (John's former girlfriend), to open the first Fry's Electronics store at a 20,000sqft (1,900m2) site in Sunnyvale, California.[4] Today, Fry's Food and Drug stores are owned and operated by Kroger and are not affiliated with Fry's Electronics, although they share a similar logo.[5]The original Sunnyvale store (located near the intersection of Oakmead Parkway and Lakeside Drive) stocked numerous high-tech supplies such as integrated circuits, test and measurement equipment, and computer components, as well as software and various other types of consumer electronics. The store also sold T-shirts, technical books, and magazines, including Playboy. At first, approximately half the store was stocked with groceries including fresh produce, but the groceries section quickly diminished to displays of soft drinks and snack foods. The store billed itself as "The One-Stop Shop for the Silicon Valley Professional," as one could buy both electronics and groceries at the same time.As the business expanded, the original Sunnyvale store was closed, and a newer, larger store was opened across Lawrence Expressway on Kern Avenue. The second Sunnyvale store was designed to look like the interior of a giant computer; the walls were adorned with simulated circuit components, and the floor resembled a giant printed circuit board. The exterior was painted to mimic a huge DIP integrated circuit, and the door handles imitated the ENTER and ESC keys on a Computer keyboard; as of 2007, this store is now a Sports Basement store (which still bears some of the door handle keys). Fry's moved again to its current Sunnyvale location on the corner of Arques and Santa Trinita Ave. Each of the Sunnyvale store locations has been located within one mile of the others.In 1996, for reasons that the Fry brothers have never publicly disclosed, they transferred all their shares of Fry's Electronics to a limited liability company called RDL, LLC, and a limited partnership called The Taw, L.P. (the latter also controls the former), and since then, they have controlled Fry's Electronics indirectly through those entities. Their existence became publicly known in January 2012 because Randy Fry's ex-wife, Laurie Hammer had attempted to challenge a post-nuptial settlement agreement under which she agreed to accept "units" of The Taw in settlement of her claims against Randy. On January 23, 2012, the California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District upheld the trial court's dismissal of her lawsuit in an unpublished opinion.Because Fry's stores are enormous, often stocking dozens of variations of a single type of product, they are popular with electronics and computer hobbyists. Historically, Circuit City and CompUSA were major competitors, but they collapsed during the late-2000s recession, leaving Best Buy as Fry's main competitor. Unlike Best Buy, Fry's sells not only fully assembled computers, but all the individual components which consumers need to build their own from scratch.As of May 2007, Fry's Electronics operated 34 brick-and-mortar stores in nine U.S. states: California (17 stores); Texas (8); Arizona (2); Georgia (2); Illinois (1); Indiana (1); Nevada (1); Oregon (1); and Washington (1).Various Fry's locations are decorated in elaborate themes. For example, the Burbank store which opened in 1995 carries a theme of 1950s and 1970s science fiction movies, and features huge statues of popular characters such as the robot Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still and Darth Vader from the Star Wars movie series. In addition, giant ants (from the movie Them!) hang from the ceiling, and the bodies of 1957 Chevys and Buicks serve as dining tables in the cafe. A flying saucer protrudes above the entrance.List of themes:Arizona stores:Indiana stores:Nevada stores:Texas Stores:Since Fry's acquired the Incredible Universe chain of stores, the company has reduced the elaborateness of its themes. With the opening of the Fishers, Indiana, store, Fry's made a "race track" theme with various hanging displays, including "stop" and "go" signs. Also there are many early life photos of what life looked like in late 1800s and early 1900s in Indianapolis, IndianaIn 1997, Forbes reported on a series of issues about Fry's customer service and somewhat unorthodox business practices. Among the allegations was that the company had an internal policy, identified as "the double H" or "hoops and hurdles", to delay or prevent customers from obtaining refunds.[7]In 1998, USA Today reported that many customers had become frustrated with poor customer service at Fry's stores.[8]Fry's advertising methods have also gone under heavy fire. In 2003, actors Denzel Washington, Bruce Willis and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger sued Fry's for $10 million each for posting their images on television sets on their print ads and flyers without permission.[9]On Black Friday 2007, customers at the Renton, Washington, location complained that Fry's employees were offering to let people cut in front of a long line for a fee. After complaints in the media, Fry's management offered anyone who paid the fee their money back.[10]In 2008, Fry's vice president of merchandising and operations, Ausuf Umar Siddiqui, was charged by federal prosecutors in an illegal kickback scheme involving Fry's vendors. The alleged scheme was designed to defraud the company in order to cover Siddiqui's gambling expenses.[11]In September of 2012, Fry's Electronics agreed to pay $2.3 million and to implement preventative measures to settle a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The settlement was in relation to allegations that an assistant store manager at the Renton store harassed a 20-year-old sales associate by frequently sending her sexually charged text messages and inviting her to his house to drink. After her direct supervisor reported the harassment to Fry's legal department, the company allegedly fired the female salesperson and fired her supervisor for standing up for her.[12]Fry's Electronics was late in establishing an online sales presence. They began offering low-cost Internet access in 2000 through their original Web address "Frys.com".[13] The company later bought e-commerce website Cyberian Outpost in November 2001 and started online sales with a different URL (Outpost.com),[14] which confused customers who didn't associate the online name with the brick-and-mortar store.[15] In October 2006, a grand re-opening of Frys.com introduced the online store with the same name as the retail outlets.[16][17] The outpost.com URL now redirects to the frys.com online store.The domain name frys.com was owned in 1997 by David Peter, aka David Peter Burlini,[18] who manufactured and sold French fry vending machines under the business name Frenchy Frys and who was also involved in another dispute over the domain newricochet.com with Ricochet Networks.[18] David Burlini[19] attended Santa Clara University around the same time that the Fry Brothers were attending.[20] Fry's Electronics brought suit against him that year, alleging trademark infringement, and ultimately prevailed in a default judgment.[21][22]Since then, Fry's Electronics has aggressively tried to defend its trademark and domain names. In 2001, it successfully prosecuted a man who was posting its own print ads on the Web using the domain frysad.com.[23] In 2007, Fry's Electronics lost a domain dispute against Prophet Partners Inc., an online advertising company with thousands of generic and descriptive domain names. The arbitrator dismissed the complaint, which requested transfer of the Frys.us domain, ruling that Fry's Electronics did not have any more right to use the "Fry's" mark than other entities with a similar surname or commercial use of the word.[24]1 History

iTunes is a media player and media library application developed by Apple Inc. It is used to play, download, save, and organize digital audio and video on personal computers running the OS X operating system and the iOS-based iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices. Editions of iTunes are also released for Microsoft Windows. It can connect to the iTunes Store to let users purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, iPod games, audiobooks, podcasts, movies and movie rentals in select countries, and ringtones, available on the iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth generation onward.) It is also used to download application software from the App Store for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. iTunes has been criticized for not being able to transfer music from one portable device to another.iTunes was introduced on January 9, 2001.[3] In June 2010, Apple released a new privacy policy relating to the establishment and collection of users' real-time location information.[4] The information had been included in various device-specific EULAs since 2008, but was not included in Apple's general privacy policy until 2010.[5]Alongside the launch of the iPhone 5, iPod Nano, and iPod Touch, Apple announced iTunes 11. Including a revamped user interface, tighter iCloud integration, and new features, iTunes 11 was billed for release in October 2012.[6] However, the launch was pushed back to November 29, with Apple citing extra development time as the cause for this delay. iTunes 11 is available as an update for Mac OS X, and via a download for Microsoft's Windows operating system.SoundJam MP, developed by Bill Kincaid and released by Casady & Greene in 1999,[7] was renamed iTunes when Apple purchased it in 2000. Jeff Robbin, Kincaid, and Dave Heller moved to Apple as part of the acquisition, where they continue to work today as the software's original developers. They simplified SoundJam's user interface, added the ability to burn CDs, and removed its recording feature and skin support.[8] On January 9, 2001, iTunes 1.0 was released at Macworld San Francisco. Macintosh users immediately began poking through iTunes' resource fork, where they discovered numerous strings and other resources that indicated iTunes was a re-engineered SoundJam MP. Casady & Greene ceased distribution of SoundJam MP on June 1, 2001 at the request of the developers.[9]Originally a Mac OS 9-only application, iTunes began to support Mac OS X when version 2.0 was released nine months later, which also added support for the original iPod.[10] version 3 dropped Mac OS 9 support but added smart playlists and a ratings system.[11] In April 2003, version 4.0 introduced the iTunes Store; in October, version 4.1 added support for Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows XP.[12] Introduced at Macworld 2005 with the new iPod Shuffle, Version 4.7.1 introduced the ability to automatically convert higher-bitrate songs to 128kbit/s AAC as these devices did not natively support audio encoded in AIFF or Apple Lossless formats, also improving the value proposition of the Shuffle's limited flash-only storage.[13] Version 7.0 introduced gapless playback and Cover Flow in September 2006.[14] In March 2007, iTunes 7.1 added support for Windows Vista,[15] and 7.3.2 was the last Windows 2000 version.[16] iTunes lacked support for 64-bit versions of Windows until the 7.6 update on January 16, 2008. iTunes is currently supported under any 64-bit version of Windows Vista, although the iTunes executable is still 32-bit. The 64-bit versions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are not supported by Apple, but a workaround has been devised for both operating systems.[17] Version 8.0 added Genius playlists, grid view, and a new default visualizer.[18] iTunes 9 added "Home Share", enabling automatic updating of purchased items across other computers on the same subnet and offers a new iTunes Store UI. Genius Mixes were added, as well as improved app synchronization abilities, extending the iPod Shuffle 128 kbit/s down-convert feature to all of Apple's AAC-capable devices.[19] It also adds iTunes LPs to the store, which provides additional media with an album. Apple added iTunes Extras as well to the store, which adds content usually reserved for films on DVD and Blu-ray discs.[20] Both iTunes LPs and Extras use web-standards HTML, JavaScript and CSS.[21]A version of iTunes[22] was shipped with cell phones from Motorola, which included the ability to sync music from an iTunes library to the cellphone, as well as a similar interface between both platforms. Since the release of the iPhone, Apple has stopped distributing iTunes with other manufacturers' phones. In the absence of support from Apple, Nokia has released a Mac application called Nokia Multimedia Transfer that supports transferring data from iTunes and iPhoto onto some Nokia devices.[23] Palm, however, reverse-engineered iTunes to allow its Pre device to sync directly with iTunes. It did this by fooling iTunes into thinking the device was an iPod.[24]In late March 2010, Apple released version 9.1, which has support for the iPad and its iBooks application.[25] iTunes 11 was released on November 29, 2012.In late June 2010, Apple released version 9.2, which brought support for the new iPhone 4, as well as any iDevices running iOS 4, and included support for the new iPhone and iPod Touch version of the iBooks app.[26]On September 1, 2010, Apple held their annual music press event, where they unveiled an updated version: iTunes 10. The new version was available for download later that day. One major feature includes the integration of iTunes Ping, which brings a social factor to the iTunes experience. Apple CEO Steve Jobs also announced a new logo, one without a CD in the background because of the increasing popularity of iTunes digital downloads.[citation needed]On November 29, 2012, Apple released iTunes 11. The update included a new user interface that dropped Cover Flow in favor of a redesigned grid layout. Other new features included an improved MiniPlayer, tighter iCloud integration, and a new iTunes Store design. iTunes Ping was dropped in favor of more advanced Twitter and Facebook integration.iTunes acts as a front end for Apple's QuickTime media player. Officially, it is required in order to manage the audio data of an iPod, iPhone, or iPad, although alternative software does exist. Users can organize their music into playlists within one or more libraries, edit file information, record Compact Discs, copy files to a digital audio player, purchase music and videos through its built-in music store (iTunes Store), download free podcasts, back up songs onto a CD or DVD, run a visualizer to display graphical effects in time to the music, and encode music into a number of different audio formats. There is also a large selection of free internet radio stations to listen to. Additionally, users can add PDF files to their library (to add digital liner notes to their albums, for example). The PDFs can be synchronized with and read on an iPod Touch, iPhone, or iPad, but not a regular iPod.[27]In iTunes 8.0 saw the removal of several options in the Preferences window. For example, iTunes once gave users the option to display arrows beside the selected song's title, artist, album, and genre that link directly to the iTunes Store. These arrows are no longer removable, except through the direct editing of a preferences file.[28]iTunes keeps track of songs by creating a virtual library, allowing users to access and edit a song's attributes. These attributes, known as metadata, are stored in two separate library files. The first is a binary file called iTunes Library and it uses a proprietary file format ("ITL"). It caches information like artist and genre from the audio format's tag capabilities (the ID3 tag, for example) and stores iTunes-specific information like play count and rating. iTunes typically reads library data only from this file.[29] The second file, iTunes Music Library.xml, is refreshed whenever information in iTunes is changed. It uses an XML format, allowing developers to easily write applications that can access the library information (including play count, last played date, and rating, which are not standard fields in the ID3v2.3 format). Apple's own iDVD, iMovie, and iPhoto applications all access the library.[30] If the first file exists but is corrupted, such as by making it zero-length, iTunes will attempt to reconstruct it from the XML file. Detailed third-party instructions regarding this are documented elsewhere.[31] Beginning with iTunes 10.5.3 this behavior has been changed such that the XML file is not read automatically to recreate the database when the database is corrupted. Rather, the user should load the iTunes Library.xml file via File > Library > Import Playlist....It has also been noted that iTunes does not automatically track changes to actual files in the library. If a file is moved or deleted, iTunes will display an exclamation mark beside the library entry and the user will need to manually amend the library record. Several third party tools address this problem.[32]iTunes supports ripping from CDs, but not from DVDs. However, in 2008, Apple and select film studios introduced "iTunes Digital Copy", a bonus feature on some DVDs that provides a copy-protected and iTunes-compatible file for select films.[33]iTunes 11 can currently read, write and convert between MP3, AIFF, WAV, MPEG-4, AAC and Apple Lossless (.m4a).[34]iTunes can also play any audio files that QuickTime can play (as well as some video formats), including Protected AAC files from the iTunes Store and Audible.com audio books. There is limited support for Vorbis and FLAC enclosed in an Ogg container (files using the Ogg container format are not natively supported) or Speex codecs with the Xiph QuickTime Components. Because tag editing and album art is done within iTunes and not QuickTime, these features will not work with these QuickTime components. As of Snow Leopard, iTunes 9 (Mac) will play HE-AAC / AAC+ internet streams. The latest version of iTunes (Win/Mac) supports importing audio CDs with the default iTunes standard file format of AAC at 256kbit/s, but users can choose from 16kbit/s to 320kbit/s constant bit rates (CBR) in either AAC or MP3.[citation needed] Importing of audio CDs into MP3 or AAC formats can also be accomplished using variable bitrate (VBR) encoding.The Windows version of iTunes can automatically transcode DRM-free WMA (including version 9) files to other audio formats, but does not support playback of WMA files and will not transcode DRM protected WMA files. Telestream, Inc. provides free codecs for Mac users of QuickTime to enable playback of unprotected Windows Media files. These codecs are recommended by Microsoft.[35]In addition to importing CDs into the iTunes library, the user can also import non-Apple mp3 files from Amazon.com and other sources. This can be accomplished by either right clicking on the file, selecting open with, and then selecting iTunes or dragging the file into the open iTunes window. Alternatively, for Amazon.com mp3s, the Amazon MP3 Downloader application will automatically import the mp3 files into the iTunes library.[36]For MP3 files, iTunes writes tags in ID3v2.2 using UCS-2 encoding by default, but converting them to ID3v2.3 (UCS-2 encoding) and ID3v2.4 (which uses UTF-8 encoding) is possible via its "Advanced" > "Convert ID3 Tags" toolbar menu. If both ID3v2.x and ID3v1.x tags are in a file, iTunes ignores the ID3v1.x tags.[37]Advanced Audio Coding and Apple Lossless files support Unicode metadata, stored in the MPEG-4 Part 14 container as so-called "atoms". The QuickTime plugin that supports the OGG container format has no support for tag editing or album art.[37][citation needed] iTunes uses the Gracenote interactive audio CD database to provide track name listings for audio CDs. The service can be set to activate when a CD is inserted into the computer and an Internet connection is available. Track names for albums imported to iTunes while not connected to the Internet can be obtained during a later connection, by a manual procedure.[38] For any album loaded into iTunes for which there is not an existing Gracenote track listing, the user can choose to submit track name data to Gracenote.[39]File metadata is displayed in columns, including album, artist, beats per minute, bit rate, composer, date added, date modified, disc number, genre, last played, last skipped, plays, purchase date, size, skips, time, track number, year, and a few fields that may be supplied by users, such as description, kind, and rating. Metadata fields not loaded with the song, or added by a user, remain blank.The Genius feature, introduced in iTunes 8, automatically generates a playlist of songs from the user's library which are similar to the selected song. Genius playlists are created by the ratings system and collaborative filtering. An iTunes Store account is required because information about the user's library must first be sent anonymously to Apple's database. Algorithms determine which songs to play based on other users' libraries, and Genius becomes more intelligent given a larger data set. The resulting Genius playlist can contain 25, 50, 75, or 100 songs and can be refreshed for new results or saved. The iTunes Sidebar recommends selections for purchase from the iTunes Store based on the selected library track.[40] Once Genius becomes active in iTunes, it can be used on current generations of the iPod Classic, iPod Nano, iPod Touch or the iPhone.[41] iTunes 9 added Genius Mixes, where the Genius software finds similar music and automatically puts them into mixes.[42] iTunes Genius creates playlists from the user's existing iTunes library based on a single selected song. Genius Mixes create playlists based on the musical genre.One way of sharing a library is over the network, known as network sharing. A user's iTunes Library can be shared over a local network using the closed, proprietary Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP), created by Apple for this purpose. DAAP relies on the Bonjour network service discovery framework, Apple's implementation of the Zeroconf open network standard. Apple has not made the DAAP specification available to the general public, only to third-party licensees such as Roku. However, the protocol has been reverse-engineered and is now used to stream audio from non-Apple software (mainly on the Linux platform).[43] DAAP allows shared lists of songs within the same subnet to be automatically detected. When a song is shared, iTunes can stream the song but won't save it on the local hard drive, in order to prevent unauthorized copying. Songs in Protected AAC format can also be accessed, but authentication is required. A maximum of five users may connect to a single user every 24 hours. The multiple, alternate "View" options normally available to iTunes users including "Cover Flow" are disabled when viewing a shared library over a network.[citation needed]Library sharing was first introduced with iTunes 4.0, where users could freely access shared music anywhere over the Internet, in addition to one's own subnet, by specifying IP addresses of remote shared song libraries. Apple quickly removed this feature with version 4.0.1, claiming that users were violating the End User License Agreement.[44]With the release of iTunes 7.0, Apple changed their implementation of DAAP. This change prevents any third-party client, such as a computer running Linux, a modified Xbox, or any computer without iTunes installed, from connecting to a remote iTunes repository. iTunes will still connect as a client to other iTunes servers and to third-party servers.[45]iTunes libraries can also be shared using the Home Share option. This option enables users to share both video and audio files through the application. This allows users to also look for items that they dont already have.[46] Like network sharing, it allows users to share over the same network to up to five computers. The media can then be transferred to any type of iPod or iPad. To set up home sharing, the two computers being used must be on the same network as well as set up using the same Apple ID.Another option to share music files is to burn CDs. To do this the user needs to create a playlist with the songs the user wishes to share. If the playlist exceeds roughly twenty songs it is likely they will need to make multiple CDs. By inserting a disk into the disk drive a button on the bottom of the window should give the option to burn a disk. The files are automatically downloaded to the disk and may be uploaded onto another computer or saved as a backup for the users computer.iTunes allows users to choose different ways to categorise their collection, and displays content according to the selection. The default settings show the music collection sorted by album, laying out the artwork in a grid similar to the iPad music application. When selected, albums extend downwards, showing their contents, and allowing users to browse the store for missing or related content. The content listings are themed depending on the predominant color of the album artwork. Film and television shows are laid out in the same manner, with their posters or artwork laid out in a grid. Users may alternately arrange their music collection as a list of every song, by genre, or by artist. These show details in a list structure, but the latter two include the album artwork as thumbnails to aid navigation. Items are automatically arranged alphabetically by album name, but users may rearrange this if using the song list option.iTunes 11 removes the Cover Flow option, previously the default viewing method for a user's music collection. It also disables the sidebar, focussing on spreading content across the width of the window. The status bar is also disabled by default. Both of these may be reactivated by the user. The sidebar design has been slightly altered, reinstating the colored icons removed in iTunes 10. When the sidebar is not activated, users can move between media libraries using a drop down menu below the control buttons.In addition to static playlist support, version 3 of iTunes introduced support for smart playlists.[47] Smart playlists are playlists that can be set to automatically filter the library based on a customized list of selection criteria, much like a database query. Multiple criteria can be entered to manage the smart playlist.[48]Some automatic smart playlists that are added to the users library include Top 25 Most Played, Recently Played, Recently Added, My Top Rated, Music Videos, Classical Music, Purchased, and 90s Music. While creating Smart Playlists the user has to choose whether they want the playlist to be based on genre, whether or not the songs have album artwork, date added, etc. and if they want it to contain or not contain certain genres or artists. For example, a genre like country music, or songs added in a specific month or year, or an individual artist. The user can also limit the amount of songs they want in the playlist or they can leave it as unlimited. The Live Updating option will automatically update their new playlist as their library changes.[49]Any user of iTunes can publish a playlist to the iTunes Store with his or her own preferences, which is called an iMix.Introduced in iTunes 4.5,[50] the "Party Shuffle" playlist was intended as a simple DJing aid.[51] By default, it selects tracks randomly from other playlists or the library, but users can override the automatic selections by deleting tracks (iTunes will choose new ones to replace them) or by adding their own via drag-and-drop or contextual menu. This allows a mixture of both preselected and random tracks in the same meta-playlist. The playlist from which Party Shuffle drew could be changed on the fly by the computer user, but doing so will cause all randomly chosen tracks to disappear and be replaced.Party Shuffle was renamed iTunes DJ in iTunes 8. When iTunes was updated to 8.1, quite a few features were added to iTunes DJ. The free Apple Remote application for the iPhone and iPod Touch was also updated at this time that added a new iTunes DJ option in the settings screen when the user is connected to a Wi-Fi network and a new song request feature is enabled in iTunes DJ on the hosts. Along with the song request feature voting on songs in the queue was added, the more votes a song gets the higher in the queue it will be and the sooner it will be played. Song voting can only be done when song requesting is enabled and in two ways: the first by right clicking on a song in the iTunes DJ queue on the host's computer in iTunes, the second is in the Remote application ether connected with the iTunes DJ option by a guest or by the host in the full playlist section. When song requesting is enabled a customizable welcome message is displayed below the host's shared library name in the button used to connect to iTunes DJ.[52]Playlists can be played randomly or sequentially. The randomness of the shuffle algorithm can be biased for or against playing multiple tracks from the same album or artists in sequence (a feature introduced in iTunes 5.0, and later discontinued in iTunes 8.0). iTunes DJ can also be biased towards selecting tracks with a higher star rating.With the release of iTunes 11, the iTunes DJ feature was removed in favor of the Up Next feature, which allows users to specify a song from their collection to play next, add it to a queue of songs to be played, or view a list of previously played tracks. However, the Up Next feature does not include features previously found in iTunes DJ, such as the ability to for guests to request songs.The App section on iTunes keeps track of all of the apps the user has downloaded or purchased. It also organizes their apps by genre and there is another tab that lets the user see all of their apps. It also informs the user when they have updates available for their apps.iTunes includes sound processing features, such as equalization, "sound enhancement" and crossfade. There is also a feature called "Sound Check", which automatically adjusts the playback volume of all songs in the library to the same level; this is usually called volume leveling or audio normalization. Like "sound enhancement" and crossfade, this can be turned on in the Playback section of iTunes' preferences.In October 2005, the iTunes Store began to offer the option of downloading television shows.[53] iTunes offers the option of buying individual episodes of TV shows for $1.99 in standard definition or $2.99 in high definition. The high definition feature on TV shows was added in July 2008.[54] iTunes also offers the ability to buy a season pass for television shows. This allows viewers to buy an entire season that automatically downloads new episodes around twenty-four hours after they air. In the iTunes library, these shows are then categorized by season of the particular show. iTunes also gives the option of ordering shows based on: series, genre, or whether or not the episodes are unwatched. In fall of 2010 iTunes offered TV show rental options, but as of August 2011 this option is no longer offered.[55]In September 2006, iTunes progressed to selling full-length films.[54] This entails downloading movies from the iTunes store. The prices for these range from: $9.99, $14.99 if it is a new release, and $19.99 if it is in High Definition.[56] iTunes also gives the option of renting movies, which began in January 2008.[54] The price for renting a movie can range from $0.99 if the movie is on sale, $3.99, and $4.99 if the rental is HD. However, iTunes sometimes carries, for a limited time, movies to rent that are available OnDemand, for a price of $6.99 in both SD and HD. Once a rental is downloaded the viewer has thirty days to watch the movie before it expires. Once the viewer begins to watch the movie he/she has twenty-four hours to finish the movie before it expires. Movies can be organized in the iTunes library by title, genre, or unwatched.On May 9, 2005, video support was introduced to iTunes with the release of iTunes 4.8. Users can drag and drop video clips from the computer into the iTunes Library for cataloguing and organization. They can be viewed in a small frame in the main iTunes display, in a separate window, or fullscreen. Before version 7 provided separate libraries for media types, videos were only distinguished from audio in the Library by a small icon resembling a TV screen and grouped with music in the library, organized by the same musical categories (such as "album" and "composer").On October 12, 2005, Apple introduced iTunes 6.0, which added support for purchasing and viewing of video content from the iTunes Music Store. The iTunes Music Store initially offered a selection of thousands of Music Videos and five TV shows, including most notably the ABC network's Lost and Desperate Housewives. Disney Channel shows (The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and That's So Raven) were also offered 24 hours after airing, as well as episode packs from past seasons. Since then, the collection has expanded to include content from numerous television networks. The iTunes Music Store also gives the ability to view Apple's large collection of film trailers.As of September 5, 2006, the iTunes Store offers over 550 television shows for download. Additionally, a catalog of 75 feature-length films from Disney-owned studios was introduced. As of April 11, 2007, over 500 feature-length films are available through iTunes.[57]Originally, films and TV shows were only available to U.S. customers, with the only video content available to non-U.S. customers being music videos and Pixar's short films. This feature is being extended to other countries as licensing issues are resolved.Video content available from the store used to be encoded as 540kbit/s Protected MPEG-4 video (H.264) with an approximately 128kbit/s AAC audio track. Many videos and video podcasts currently require the latest version of QuickTime, QuickTime 7, which is incompatible with older versions of Mac OS (only v10.3.9 and later are supported). On September 12, 2006, the resolution of video content sold on the iTunes Store was increased from 320240 (QVGA) to 640480 (VGA). The higher resolution video content is encoded as 1.5 Mbit/s (minimum) Protected MPEG-4 video (H.264) with a minimum 128kbit/s AAC audio track.In February 2010, Apple announced the release of the iPad, and along with it a new app for it called iBooks. The application performs two functions. The first function is as a direct link to the iTunes book store, called iBookstore, which can be accessed on iOS devices and computers (Mac or PC). The second was as a storage place for downloaded books (whether free or purchased) from the iBookstore. The format of books from the Apple store (and the only one users could use with iBooks, until PDF functionality was added later) is ePub.Additional functions were later added in mid-2010 to include annotations and placeholder/bookmarks in any book being read. Also PDF documents were able to be added, and were stored under their own tab in a user's iBooks library, with the same functionality. The iBooks app for the other two iOS devices (iPhone and iPod Touch) was released when iOS 4 was distributed shortly before the release of the iPhone 4.One current limitation of books (though not PDF documents) is that they can only be read using the app on any iOS device and cannot be read inside iTunes on a user's Mac or PC. PDF documents can be read using Preview or any other PDF reader/editor application the user has on their machine.On January 19, 2012, Apple announced a new part of the Books store with textbooks. They also released a new authoring method called iBooks Author.While iTunes 10 supported iCloud, it did not integrate offline and cloud libraries. A list of previously purchased content was accessible via the iTunes store, where users could download content to the device they were using. Automatic downloading of newly purchased content could also be enabled, and iTunes Match allowed content purchased outside of the iTunes store to be uploaded to iCloud. With the release of iTunes 11, iCloud became fully integrated into iTunes. Content stored in a user's iCloud is displayed in the same way as that stored on their device, and online content does not have to be downloaded to be played. Films and TV shows also resume from where they were left off on the last device to have played them.Version 4 of iTunes introduced the iTunes Store, then named the iTunes Music Store, from which iTunes users can buy and download songs for use on a limited number of computers and an unlimited number of iPods. In previous years, purchased music from the iTunes Store were copy protected with Apple's FairPlay digital rights management (DRM) system which allows protected songs to be played on up to five computers at one time, as well as unlimited devices (iPod, AppleTV, etc.) DRM protected songs cannot be played on computers not authorized to the purchaser's iTunes account. At the 2009 Macworld Conference & Expo, it was announced that the iTunes Music Store would be DRM-free, with all songs digital rights management (DRM)-free by April 2009.[58]Apple also announced changes in their price tier. They announced that songs will now cost $0.69, $0.99, or $1.29, but did not elaborate on how they will be priced. Observers expected new hits to be $1.29 while older songs will be the cheaper $0.99 or $0.69 tier.[59] However, many record labels have listed whole catalogs by artists with nothing but $1.29 songs, taking advantage of the price option. Due to this, there are very few songs in the iTunes store with a $0.69 price tag.[60]In the years since, films, television programs, music videos, podcasts, and the App Store (for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad) have been added to iTunes' extensive store catalog.On January 6, 2009, Phil Schiller announced in his Macworld 2009 keynote speech that over 6 billion songs had been downloaded since the service first launched on April 28, 2003,[61] making it the largest online music store in the world.At the previous Macworld Expo 2008, Apple CEO Steve Jobs stated that the service had set a new single day record of 20 million songs on December 25, 2007. He also announced that the iTunes Store will offer over 1,000 movies for rental by the end of February.[62] The iTunes movie catalog includes content from 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., Walt Disney Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, and Sony Pictures Entertainment. These movies will also be transferable to all 6th generation iPods.[63]On February 24, 2010, Apple announced that over 10 billion tracks had been downloaded from the iTunes Store.[64]As of Tuesday, November 16, 2010, Beatles fans could download their entire catalog digitally via iTunes.[65] Artists whose music remains largely unavailable include Garth Brooks, Kid Rock, Tool, and Bob Seger. Def Leppard albums are no longer available through iTunes.[66]On May 30, 2007, Apple announced the launch of "iTunes U" via its digital content store, iTunes, which delivers university lectures through a format called iTunesU.[67][68] The service was created to manage, distribute, and control access to educational audio and video content for students in a college or university. Member institutions have the opportunity to have their own iTunes U site, which facilitates searching for material. The online service is free for uploading or downloading these documents. iTunes U includes lectures, language lessons, lab demonstrations, sports, and campus tours provided by many colleges and universities in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand.Right around the end of 2009/start of 2010, new members' institutions no longer have the capability to upload content to Apple's servers. Any member institutions before that are grandfathered in.[citation needed]iTunes U has collected materials from a variety of locations around the world, including colleges, universities, museums, libraries and other cultural institutions of educational value. There are currently more than 75,000 files available for download. The Open University in the UK set the record for the most downloads as of October 3, 2011 having reached 40 million downloads.[69]In late August 2010, iTunes U surpassed 300 million downloads from more than 800 institutions.[citation needed]Version 4.9 of iTunes, released on June 28, 2005, added built-in support for podcasts.[70]Users can subscribe to any podcast by entering its RSS feed URL, but also by browsing the podcast directory within iTunes Music Store. The front page of this displays high-profile podcasts from commercial broadcasters and independent podcasters and allows searching by category or popularity. Once subscribed, the podcast can be set to download manually, or automatically and as with other audio, content can be listened to directly or synced to a portable hardware device like an MP3 player.The addition of podcasting functionality to such a widespread audio application like iTunes greatly helped podcasting enter the mainstream.[71] Within days after iTunes 4.9 was released, podcasters were reporting that the number of downloads of their audio files had tripled, sometimes even quadrupled,[72] and iTunes is considered the dominant podcast client.iTunes offers the ability to create "Smart Playlists" that can be used to control which podcasts are in the playlist, using multiple criteria such as date, number of times listened to, type, etc.[73] It is also possible to set up iTunes so that only certain playlists will be synced with the iPod. By using a combination of the two techniques, it is possible to control exactly which music and/or podcasts will be transferred to the iPod. A user may configure a smart playlist to display only podcasts less than two weeks old or removing any podcast that the iPod user has already listened to. This smart playlist is synced with the iPod every time the iPod is plugged into the PC, ensuring that the user does not have to listen to the same show more than once. Once a podcast has been listened to, it will be removed from this list as soon as the iPod is synced with the PC. There are many criteria which can control what goes in a smart playlist, such as "name", "artist", "category", "grouping", "kind", "last played", "play count", "rating", "last skipped", and "playlist" and these can be combined with functions such as "equals", "is greater than", "is less than", "contains", "does not contain", "is true", "is false", "is", "is not", "starts with", "ends with", "is in the range", "is before", and "is after". As a result, it is possible to control exactly which podcasts are transferred to the iPod.Version 6 of iTunes introduced official support for video podcasting, although video and RSS support was already unofficially there in version 4.9.[74]Users can subscribe to RSS feeds through the iTunes Store or by directly entering the feed URL. Video podcasts can contain downloadable video files (in MOV, MP4, M4V, or MPG format), but also streaming sources and even IPTV.[75]Downloadable files can be synchronized to a video-capable iPod, or downloadable files and streams can be shown in Front Row.[74]iTunes 2 was the first version of the software to be able to sync with an iPod. iTunes can automatically synchronize its music and video library with an iPod or iPhone every time it is connected. New songs and playlists are automatically copied to the iPod, and songs and playlists that have been deleted from the library on the host computer are also deleted from the iPod. Ratings awarded to songs on the iPod will sync back to the iTunes library and audiobooks will also remember the current playback position.Automatic synchronization can be turned off in favor of manually copying individual songs or complete playlists. iTunes supports copying music to an iPod; however, only music and videos purchased from the iTunes Store can be transferred from the iPod back to iTunes. This functionality was added after third-party software was written which allowed users to copy all content back to their computer. It is also possible to copy from the iPod using ordinary Unix command line tools, or by enabling hidden file viewing in Windows Explorer, then copying music from the iPod drive to a local disk for backup. Doing this can be confusing because the files are arranged in such a way that their folders and (depending on iPod and iTunes versions) file names are seemingly picked at random as they are put on the iPod. It is worth noting, however, that the files (along with their embedded title and artist information) remain unchanged. It is therefore less confusing to let iTunes reimport, reorganize, and rename all of the files after they are backed up. When music or video purchased through the iTunes Store is copied from an iPod, it will only play on computers that are authorized with the account that was used to purchase them. Several third party utilities can remove this limitation by stripping iTunes DRM from protected files. The legality of using such software in the United States is currently the subject of active debate.[76]When an iPod is connected that does not contain enough free space to sync the entire iTunes music library, a playlist will be created and given a name matching that of the connected iPod. This playlist can then be modified to the user's preference in song selection to fill the available space.The Mac OS X version of iTunes can also synchronize with a small number of discontinued digital music players,[77] while the Windows version supports only the iPod.[78] The synchronization is limited, however, in that the iPod is the only digital music player compatible with Apple's proprietary FairPlay digital rights management technology, and thus most music purchased through the iTunes Store (before the introduction of iTunes Plus) can only be played on an iPod. The remaining ability to synchronize with a limited number of legacy digital music players is likely a remnant of Apple's history in the music industry: iTunes was released in January 2001, nine months prior to the iPod's unveiling, and slightly more than two years before the introduction of the iTunes Music Store. When iTunes was released, compatibility with other music players was critical. Since iPod has now become the dominant digital music player, Apple no longer considers that compatibility to be a necessity.In June 2009, Palm Inc released the Palm Pre, which has the ability to sync with both the Windows and Mac OS X version of iTunes by identifying itself to iTunes as an iPod. The Pre is able to sync only DRM-free music.[79] However, on July 14, 2009, Apple released iTunes version 8.2.1, which prevented the Palm Pre from syncing directly with iTunes. Then on July 23, 2009, Palm Inc released WebOS 1.1, re-enabling syncing between iTunes 8.2.1 and the Palm Pre.[80] But Apple again prevented Palm Pre syncing with the release of iTunes 9.[81]A number of unsupported third-party applications have been created to assist synchronization of songs with any music player that can be mounted as an external drive. Though iTunes is the only official method for synchronizing with the iPod, there are other applications available that allow the iPod to sync with other software players.As of iTunes 7, purchased music can be copied from the iPod onto the computer. The computer must be authorized by that iTunes account. iTunes currently allows up to 5 computers to be authorized on one account. To de-authorize and register new computers thereafter, all accounts must be deleted, followed by registering the live one. This can be done only once a year.iTunes does not feature any transfer facility for importing music files between computers directly. This is being addressed in September 2011 by iCloud, but only tracks that Apple sell in their iTunes Store are available (in 256 kbit/s AAC format) without uploading them to iCloud first. Any other tracks, that are either not available in the Store or that the user wants in different encoding can be uploaded to the iCloud with 5 GB of free space and the, as yet undisclosed, potential to purchase more storage. Though what audio formats will be accepted for upload has not been confirmed.iTunes managed content can also be accessed via the Apple TV set-top box. Files in the iTunes library can either be synchronized with the Apple TV unit, which results in their being copied to the Apple TV's hard drive (for the first generation Apple TV), or streamed to the Apple TV directly from a Macintosh or PC. Apple TV does not require the use of iTunes (as of the 'Take Two' software update) and can now import files from the iTunes Store directly over the internet.[82]As of iTunes 9.1, it is possible to sync the iPad to iTunes, allowing music, movies, applications and iBooks to be synced to the iPad. As of 10.5, iTunes supports syncing the iPhone using both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.[83]Beginning with the introduction of the original iPhone, iTunes can activate their phone through their mobile carrier. The original plan for the iPhone 3G was to have the carrier authenticate it at the point of sale, either through iTunes or through the carrier's own activation interface.[84] However, a worldwide crash of iTunes' authentication servers on July 11, 2008, the day that the iPhone 3G was released, caused major issues. In some cases, AT&T and Apple Store employees told iPhone buyers to attempt to activate it at home.[85] Also affected were original iPhone users attempting to upgrade to the 2.0 firmware.[86][87] UK Apple, O2 and Carphone Warehouse stores were further impacted, as carrier O2's contract processing servers (known as Gateway) could not handle the amount of new contracts and upgrades happening on launch day. Some stores reverted to hand written contracts, while others held stock. With the launch of the iPhone 3GS on June 19, 2009, iTunes at home activation was available for people purchasing their iPhone from AT&T Mobility and Apple. This allowed them to activate their new iPhone 3G/iPhone 3GS at home when they arrived.[88]In Mac OS X, iTunes is tightly integrated with Apple's iWork and iLife suites. These applications can access the iTunes Library directly, allowing access to the playlists and songs stored within (including encrypted music purchased from the iTunes Store). Music files from iTunes can be embedded directly into Pages documents and can supply the score for iDVD, iMovie, and Keynote productions. iTunes is also integrated with Front Row, compiling its information from the user's iTunes and iPhoto libraries. In addition, any song exported from GarageBand, Apple's basic music-making application, is automatically added to the user's iTunes music library. iTunes's Artwork.saver is a screen saver included in Mac OS X v10.4 that displays album artwork as a screen saver. iTunes widget is a Dashboard Widget that controls iTunes.In Windows, Adobe Photoshop Elements can connect to iTunes in order to stream its photo library on Apple TV.Moreover, iTunes can be scripted, using AppleScript for Mac OS X or using the Apple-provided SDK for iTunes on Windows allowing many other applications to integrate themselves into iTunes. A common use is to relay the title and artist of what the user is currently listening to into their instant messenger, or social networking service. LimeWire, which closed on October 26, 2010, was a peer-to-peer program that provided integration with iTunes, adding songs from LimeWire directly to your iTunes library without sharing your iTunes purchased songs.In addition, visualizer plugins and device plugins are supported. Visualizer plugins allow developers to create music-driven visual displays and free software development kits are available for Mac and Windows can be from Apple.[89]Device plugins allow support for additional music player devices, but the APIs is only licensed to authentic OEMs who sign a non-disclosure agreement.Apple Inc. also offers a free iOS application that allows the user to remotely control their iTunes library or Apple TV over DACP.[90] This can be downloaded from iTunes itself or directly from one's iOS device. It is only compatible with iOS v2.0 and above. In terms of usage, it is very similar to the iPod application that is included with all iPhones, with the only difference is the lack of Cover Flow support.Though iTunes itself can be installed where the user desires, ancillary applications such as Bonjour which are part of the iTunes installation cannot be placed in a user-desired directory.[91]To compensate for the lack of a physical CD, iTunes can print custom-made jewel case inserts as well as song lists and album lists. After burning a CD from a playlist, one can select that playlist and bring up a dialog box with several print options. The user can choose to print either a single album cover (for purchased iTunes albums) or a compilation cover (for user-created playlists). iTunes then automatically sets up a template with art on one side and track titles on the other.[citation needed]An iMix is a free user-created playlist published in the iTunes Store. iMixes were first introduced in iTunes version 4.5.[92] However, they are limited to 100 songs, must feature content available on the iTunes Store, and are active for one year from their original published date. iMixes are public and searchable by any iTunes user, and can be rated using a five-star system. Users can publish their iTunes iMix to their blog, profile page, or website.When iTunes was first released, it came with support for the Kerbango Internet radio tuner service, giving users a selection of some of the more popular online radio streams available.[93] When Kerbango went out of business in 2001, Apple created its own Internet radio service for use with iTunes 2.0 and later.[94] As of February 2008, the iTunes radio service features 1795 "radio stations", mostly in MP3 streaming format. Programming covers many genres of music and talk, including streams from both internet-only sources and traditional radio stations. iTunes also supports the .pls and .m3u stream file formats used by Winamp and other media players.Since the release of iTunes 7, Apple no longer promotes the Internet radio feature, though it remains in the application. Some third-parties offer iTunes plugins that add additional radio stations.In addition, users are able to enter additional stream feeds to listen to in their own music libraries. This is done by selecting the menu item "Advanced" > "Open Audio Stream..." or by the hotkey Ctrl-U (PC) or Command-U (Mac).[73]Apple revealed a new feature within iTunes 10 on September 1, 2010 called Ping,[95] which was intended to bring a social music networking component to users of iTunes. It was not made available to all countries.[96] Ping could be connected to user's Twitter accounts.[97] Ping connected user accounts of iTunes, allowing iTunes users to share and recommend music to one another.Ping also let users to follow artists to see the photos and videos they have posted, their tour dates, playlists they have created, and their comments on other artists albums. Users could create a profile so their friends could see whom they were following, what they were listening to, and what concerts they were going to. Ping also showed users' top 10 lists of songs and albums among the people they followed. It also provided artist recommendations to follow based on one's library and preference options.[98]Apple officially discontinued the service on September 30, 2012 and will replace it in iTunes with Facebook and Twitter integration.[99]In June 2010, Apple updated its general privacy policy for the iTunes Store and iOS 4 supported devices, revealing that it could and would collect real-time location-based information on users aged 13 and over.The revised policy states that Apple has the right to share this information with 3rd parties who provide services to the customer, including advertising and promotion services. Apple also states that "it may be necessary" to provide this [real-time] information in response to "requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence or if [Apple] determines that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.... Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party."The revised policy does not make any distinction between warrant-based and warrantless searches, nor provide what criteria would trigger the sharing of personal real-time information with government entities, nor allow an opt-out for the location-based information.The revised policy prompted the co-chairs of the Bi-Partisan Privacy Caucus of the United States House of Representatives to request that Apple respond to nine basic privacy questions out of concern of possible violation of that country's Federal Communications Act. The Caucus stated it was pleased with Apple's prompt written explanations, and stated they would continue to monitor the issue.[4][100]The Telegraph reported in November 2011 that Apple had been aware of a security flaw since 2008, that would let unauthorized third parties install "updates" to end-user's iTunes' software.[101] They reported that a security writer named Brian Krebs had informed Apple of the vulnerability in 2008. They reported that the flaw was only closed in November 2011. They reported that United Kingdom security software firm Gamma International developed a program named FinFisher, intended to covertly spy on computer uses, which can be clandestinely installed via bogus updates to iTunes' software. Der Spiegel reported Gamma International had advertised the capability to clandestinely install FinFisher by exploiting this iTunes vulnerability.[102]1 History2 Features

Elon University is a private liberal arts university in Elon, North Carolina, United States.[2] Formerly known as Elon College when founded in 1889, it became Elon University on June 1, 2001Elon College was founded by the Christian Church, which later became a part of the United Church of Christ. The charter for Elon College was issued by the North Carolina legislature in 1889. William S. Long was the first president, and the original student body consisted of 76 students. In 1923, a fire destroyed most of the campus, including school records, classrooms, the library, and the chapel. The Board of Trustees voted to rebuild immediately. Many of the buildings that were erected in the years following the fire still stand and make up the bedrock of Elon's campus.In the early 1970s, Elon was an undergraduate college serving mainly local residents commuting from family homes,[3] attracting "regional students of average ability from families of modest means."[4] By the start of the 21st century, however, about 68 percent of Elon's students came from out-of-state and were only accepted if they met high academic standards.[4] Elon's transformation was the subject of an academic study by George Keller of the University of Pennsylvania titled Transforming a College: The Story of a Little Known College's Strategic Climb to National Distinction. The study, published by Johns Hopkins University Press, depicted how Elon successfully transformed itself from an unimpressive college to a selective, nationally recognized university. Keller concluded that "strategic planning, financial ingenuity, faculty dedication, and strong, determined leadership," all of which were present at Elon, can transform a higher education institution.[5]Elon maintains its historic relationship to the United Church of Christ, but is no longer directly affiliated.[6] Elon's mission statement states that the university "embraces its founders' vision of an academic community that transforms mind, body, and spirit and encourages freedom of thought and liberty of conscience," and emphasizes its commitment to "nurture a rich intellectual community characterized by student engagement with a faculty dedicated to excellent teaching and scholarly accomplishment."[7]Many prominent figures have visited and spoken at Elon, including U.S. Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, former U.S. Secretaries of State General Colin L. Powell and Madeleine Albright, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,[8] Nobel Peace Prize winners Elie Wiesel and Muhammad Yunus, astronauts John Glenn and Buzz Aldrin and network news anchors Brian Williams[9] and Anderson Cooper.[10]The university includes Elon College, the College of Arts and Sciences; the Martha and Spencer Love School of Business; the School of Communications; the School of Education; the School of Law; and the School of Health Sciences. Master's programs are offered in business administration, interactive media and education, and doctoral programs include physical therapy and law. Elon operates on a 4-1-4 academic calendar, including a four-week term in January known as Winter Term.In 2009, the Phi Beta Kappa Society voted to establish a chapter at Elon, a mark of distinction for the university's commitment to meeting the high standards of excellence in the arts and sciences advocated by the Society.[11][12]Elon is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.Elon College, the College of Arts and Sciences, offers 51 undergraduate majors within three divisions: the Arts and Humanities, the Social and Behavioral Sciences, and the Natural, Mathematical and Computational Sciences. Students can also create their own independent majors, and choose from a range of minors. Students are also strongly encouraged to participate in five programs known as the "Elon Experiences": doing student undergraduate research, studying abroad, doing internships, engaging in service learning, and demonstrating leadership. Elon sends more undergraduate students to study abroad than any other master's-level school in the nation.[13] 80% of Elon students complete internships and 91% of recent graduates participated in volunteer service. Mention of participation in these programs can be included on an "Elon Experiences" transcript which accompanies the academic student transcript.[14]Admitted freshmen in the class of 2013 had a core academic GPA of 3.96, and the class included 12 high school valedictorians.[15]The average class size is 21 students, maximum class size is 35 and the 4-year graduation rate is 71%. 71% of students will complete at least one study abroad program (the national average is 6%). 84% of students will complete an internship prior to graduation. As of 2011, Freshman retention rate was 90%.[16]The Martha and Spencer Love School of Business offers undergraduate degrees in Accounting, Business Administration, Economics, Entrepreneurship, Finance, Management and Marketing. The part-time MBA program was ranked #1 in the South by BusinessWeek.The Elon School of Communications is one of 18 accredited communications programs for private universities in the US by the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC). The program encompasses 20% of students and is divided into six main concentrations: Journalism, Broadcast & New Media, Cinema, Strategic Communications, Communication Science and Sport & Event Management. The teaching staff is rich in professional experience, including a Pulitzer Prize winner, top corporate communicators, a CNN veteran and a Webby Honors winner. There are no lab fees, and students can sign out top-line digital media equipment to use for free.Students each complete at least one required internship. Workplaces include NBC, 60 Minutes, National Geographic, MTV, Dreamworks, New York Times, VOGUE and the Washington Post. Many students complete multiple internships. Some students complete an internship while enrolled in the London program and intern at international media companies headquartered there. There are summer programs in Los Angeles and New York City for students to intern and take classes there. Elon students also conduct research at or present their work at the United Nations Internet Governance Forum, Federal Communications Commission, the Broadcast Education Association conference and many other venues.[17]Students in this discipline have several opportunities to gain practical experience, whether through working on the newspaper (The Pendulum), the radio station (WSOE), or one of many award-winning shows on Elon Student Television (ESTV) including two Emmy award winning shows: One-on-One Sports, and Phoenix14 News, both recognized by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Elon also has a public relations company called Live Oak Communications, as well as a student film group known as Cinelon. In the summer of 2009, the school established an M.A. program in Interactive Media which lasts for ten months. Elon Communications is also home to sketch comedy show Elon Tonight, established in 2010.The Elon University School of Law opened on August 10, 2006. The School of Law is located in downtown Greensboro, North Carolina in the former city library. Former United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor delivered the Dedication Address on September 19, 2006. According to US News the law school is currently "unranked".Elon has a student body of 5,225 undergraduate students and 691 graduate students. 48 states, the District of Columbia, and 57 nations are represented in the student body.Elon's 17 varsity sports teams, known as the Phoenix, compete in the NCAA's Division I Southern Conference. Intercollegiate sports include baseball, basketball, cross-country, football, golf, soccer, and tennis for men, and basketball, cross-country, golf, indoor track, outdoor track, soccer, softball, tennis, and volleyball for women. The football team competes in the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (formerly I-AA).Campus Recreation offers intramural and club sports programs, such as baseball, cycling, lacrosse, flag football, equestrian, swimming, rugby union, triathlon, water skiing, ice hockey and Ultimate Frisbee. During Winter Term the intramurals include bowling, arena football, dodgeball, ultimate frisbee, and a monster golf tournament.Up until 2000, the mascot of Elon was the Fighting Christian. Early Elon athletic teams were known as the "Christians" with the name "Fighting Christians" gaining popularity by 1923.[27] The nickname was chosen due to Elon's proximity to the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, and the Duke Blue Devils.[28] However, many did not feel that the nickname was universal enough for a team making the transition to Division I athletics,[citation needed] so a new mascot was adopted in 2000, the Phoenix. The choice came from the 1923 fire that destroyed almost the entire campus. Soon after the fire, the university trustees began planning to make Elon "rise from the ashes". The Phoenix was a mythical creature that rose from the ashes of its predecessors.Elon's Fight Song was written in 1921 by Mark Z. Rhodes to the tune of F.E. Bigelow's march "Our Director."So here's to dear old Elon
Faithful and bold
Here's to her banner
Of maroon and gold
Here's to men and women
Who've come and gone
Singing the victor's song
Of old ElonElon's sports facilities include two gymnasiums, Walter C. Latham Baseball Park, Rhodes Stadium, the on-campus football stadium, Alumni Field House, Koury Field House, six club athletic fields, Worseley Golf Center, and Koury Center, which features the 2,400 seat Alumni Gym, an aerobic fitness center, a weight room, racquetball courts, an indoor pool, and a dance studio. The Jimmy Powell Tennis Center is a twelve-court state-of-the-art complex and is recognized as one of the finest collegiate tennis complexes in the nation.[29] Athletics staff and coaches began the move into Alumni Field House on Jan. 14. The 30,000-square-foot (2,800m2) facility at the north end of Rhodes Stadium in the North Athletics Complex is the new headquarters for Phoenix athletics.[30]Elon's historic campus is located in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, adjacent to Burlington, a city of 50,000. Elon is 20 minutes from Greensboro and within a one hour drive of many other universities  Duke, NC State, UNC-Chapel Hill, UNC-Greensboro, North Carolina A&T State University, and Wake Forest.Princeton Review as well as the New York Times ranked Elon University as the nation's #1 most beautiful campus. Elon's 600-acre (242.8ha) campus is divided into seven major sections: North Area, Central Campus, West Area, East Area, South Campus, Danieley Center, and Elon West. Each area consists of different services and facilities. There are 29 residence buildings on campus and 12 major academic buildings. Elon also has numerous lakes and fountains throughout its campus.Spike Lee used Elon as one of the university locations for the movie He Got Game. The Alamance Building, Fonville Fountain, and the Moseley Center's outside patio were the setting for the movie's "Tech University."The university has more than 150 campus organizations and programs, including 12 national fraternities and 13 national sororities. Elon Universities fraternities consist of the following: Delta Upsilon, Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma Pi, Kappa Alpha Order, Lambda Chi Alpha, Sigma Chi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Phi Beta Sigma, Alpha Phi Alpha and Kappa Alpha Psi. Elon Universities sororities consist of the following: Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Xi Delta, Kappa Delta, Sigma Kappa, Zeta Tau Alpha, Alpha Omicron Pi, Delta Delta Delta, Phi Mu, Sigma Sigma Sigma, Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, Zeta Phi Beta.The Pendulum, Elon's undergraduate weekly newspaper is published every Wednesday. WSOE, the University's student-run non-commercial campus radio station, has been airing since 1977. ETV (Elon Television) is the Student television station featuring numerous student-created and -run programs in addition to its nationally recognized news program, Phoenix14 News, produced by ESTV (Elon Student Television). Phoenix14News was ranked #1 college newscast by the Broadcast Education Association in 2009 and was recognized as the Best College Newscast by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.Phoenix14News was at the center of controversy in March 2010, when former student journalist Nick Ochsner was denied a complete incident report from Elons Campus Safety and Police Department following an open records request for the details surrounding a fellow student's arrest.[31] Ochsner has since sued the university and the state attorney general's office for the records.[32] On June 5, the North Carolina Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the university and the attorney general's office, holding that private university police departments, like that at Elon, are not subject to the state's open records law.[33]Numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations are represented on campus, including Elon Volunteers, Habitat for Humanity, Model UN, Epsilon Sigma Alpha, Alpha Phi Omega, the Resident Student Association, the Student Government Association, and the Student Union Board. Cultural groups on campus include the Black Cultural Society, Hillel, Intercultural Club, and Spectrum (Gay-Straight Alliance).Elon is home to the Fire of the Carolinas Marching Band (FOTC), which delivers pre-game, halftime, and occasionally post-game performances at home football games. The band also includes color guard (flag spinning) and dance auxiliary squads.Religious groups on campus include Catholic Campus Ministry, Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Baptist Student Union, Sigma Alpha Omega, and Campus Outreach.[34]The Jewish population at Elon has grown especially rapidly in recent years, with eight percent of recent classes self-identifying as Jewish,[35][36][37][38][39] though the number of Jewish students on campus is assumed by some to be higher than this.[40] Elon was profiled in Reform Judaism magazine in 2011 as a school which has "gone the extra mile" to make itself more attractive to Jewish students.[41]The Muslim student population is small but has increased dramatically in size in recent years,[42] and a Muslim Student Association has formed at Elon.[34]The Hindu population has also increased in size[43], and while there is no formal Hindu organization on campus, Hindu students report feeling accepted at Elon.[44]Elon has received praise for its efforts to build a multi-faith center that is open to students of all religious traditions.[45]Elon University recognizes 25 social Greek organizations. 43% of women and 26% of men on campus belong to one of the following campus-chartered organizations. In 2011, two new Greek organizations were installed, one IFC fraternity (Delta Upsilon) and one PHC sorority (Kappa Delta).Elon students conduct statewide polls on issues of importance to North Carolinians. Formed in 2000, the non-partisan polls' results are shared with various media outlets, citizens and researchers to facilitate representative democracy and public policy making through the better understanding of the opinions and needs of North Carolina citizens. It is one of the only polls in the country that is conducted by student callers as compared to hired workers.Polls have gauged respondents' opinions of the Presidential performance, capital punishment, and the Iraq War.Dr. Kenneth Fernandez and Dr. Jason Husser are the directors of the Elon University Poll.[46][Bill Bowes] drafted by NBA and ABA 1969Coordinates: 360626N 793005W / 36.1071867N 79.5013207W / 36.1071867; -79.50132071 History2 Academics

San Jose (/sn hoze/; Spanish: St. Joseph) is the third-largest city in California, the tenth-largest in the U.S.,[3] and the county seat of Santa Clara County which is located at the southern end of San Francisco Bay. San Jose is the largest city within Silicon Valley, which is a major component of the greater San Francisco Bay Area, a region of 7.6million people and the sixth largest metropolitan area (CSA) in the United States.[4] It is also the most populous city in Northern California.San Jose was founded on November 29, 1777, as El Pueblo de San Jos de Guadalupe, the first civilian town in the Spanish colony of Nueva California, which later became Alta California.[5] The city served as a farming community to support Spanish military installations at San Francisco and Monterey. When California gained statehood in 1850, San Jose served as its first capital.[6]After more than 150years as a small farming city, San Jose and the surrounding Santa Clara Valley became the last (and largest) contiguous area of undeveloped land surrounding the San Francisco Bay. San Jose experienced increased demand for housing from soldiers and veterans returning from World War II. San Jose then continued its aggressive expansion during the 1950s and 1960s by annexing more land area. The rapid growth of the high-technology and electronics industries further accelerated the transition from an agricultural center, to an urbanized metropolitan area.By the 1990s, San Jose's location within the booming local technology industry earned the city its nickname, Capital of Silicon Valley. San Jose now maintains global city status and is the largest city in the San Francisco Bay Area in terms of population, land area, and industrial development.[7]The U.S. Census Bureau reported the population of the city to be 945,942 as of the 2010 Census. As of January 2012 the California Department of Finance estimated the population of San Jose as 971,372.[8]San Jose, along with the Santa Clara Valley, experienced about half a century of spectacular suburban sprawl, with characteristics of intense urbanization similar to the Los Angeles area of Southern California. The city has taken definite steps to avoid becoming "L.A. North".[9]San Jose was founded by Lieutenant Jos Joaqun Moraga as Pueblo de San Jos de Guadalupe (in honor of Saint Joseph) on November 29, 1777.[10]On April 3, 1979, the San Jose City Council adopted San Jos, with the diacritical mark on the "e", as the spelling of the city name on the city seal, official stationery, office titles and department names. Also, by city council convention, this spelling of San Jos is used when the name is stated in both upper- and lower-case letters, but not when the name is stated only in upper-case letters. The accent reflects the Spanish version of the name, and the dropping of accents in all-capital writing was typical in Spanish. The name is still more commonly spelled without the diacritical mark as San Jose. The official name of the city remains City of San Jose with no diacritical mark, according to the City Charter.[11] However, the city's website uses San Jos.[12]Spanish Empire 17811821
First Mexican Empire 18211823
United Mexican States 18231848
United States 1848presentPrior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by several groups of Ohlone Native Americans.[13] The first lasting European presence began with a series of Franciscan missions established from 1769 by Father Junpero Serra.[14] On orders from Antonio Mara de Bucareli y Ursa, Spanish Viceroy of New Spain, San Jose was founded by Lieutenant Jos Joaqun Moraga as Pueblo de San Jos de Guadalupe (in honor of Saint Joseph) on November 29, 1777, to establish a farming community. The town was the first civil settlement in Alta California.[10]In 1797, the pueblo was moved from its original location, near the present-day intersection of Guadalupe Parkway and Taylor Street, to a location in what is now Downtown San Jose. San Jose came under Mexican rule in 1821 after Mexico broke with the Spanish crown. It then became part of the United States, after it capitulated in 1846 and California was annexed.[13]On March 27, 1850, San Jose became the second incorporated city in the state (after Sacramento), with Josiah Belden its first mayor. The town was the state's first capital, as well as host of the first and second sessions (18501851) of the California Legislature. Today the Circle of Palms Plaza in downtown is the historical marker for the first state capital.Though not impacted as severely as San Francisco, San Jose suffered damage from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Over 100 people died at the Agnews Asylum (later Agnews State Hospital) after its walls and roof collapsed,[15] and the San Jose High School's three-story stone-and-brick building was also destroyed. The period during World War II was a tumultuous time. Japanese Americans primarily from Japantown were sent to internment camps,[citation needed] including the future mayor, Norman Mineta. Following the Los Angeles zoot suit riots, anti-Mexican violence took place during the summer of 1943.[citation needed] In 1940, the Census Bureau reported San Jose's population as 98.5% white.[16] The entire region prepared for the beginning of the war.As World War II started, the city's economy shifted from agriculture (the Del Monte cannery was the largest employer) to industrial manufacturing with the contracting of the Food Machinery Corporation (later known as FMC Corporation) by the United States War Department to build 1000 Landing Vehicle Tracked.[17] After World War II, FMC (later United Defense, and currently BAE Systems) continued as a defense contractor, with the San Jose facilities designing and manufacturing military platforms such as the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier, the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and various subsystems of the M1 Abrams.[18]IBM established its West Coast headquarters in San Jose in 1943 and opened a downtown research and development facility in 1952. Both would prove to be harbingers for the economy of San Jose, as Reynold Johnson and his team would later invent RAMAC, as well as the Hard disk drive, and the technological side of San Jose's economy grew.[19]During the 1950s and 1960s, city manager A. P. "Dutch" Hamann led the city in a major growth campaign. The city annexed adjacent areas, such as Alviso and Cambrian Park, providing large areas for suburbs. An anti-growth reaction to the effects of rapid development emerged in the 1970s championed by mayors Norman Mineta and Janet Gray Hayes. Despite establishing an urban growth boundary, development fees, and incorporations of Campbell and Cupertino, development was not slowed, but rather directed into already incorporated areas.[17]San Jose's position in Silicon Valley triggered more economic and population growth, which led to the highest housing costs increase in the nation, 936% between 1976 and 2001.[20] Efforts to increase density continued into 1990s when an update of the 1974 urban plan kept the urban growth boundaries intact and voters rejected a ballot measure to ease development restrictions in the foothills. Sixty percent of the housing built in San Jose since 1980 and over three-quarters of the housing built since 2000 have been multifamily structures, reflecting a political propensity toward Smart Growth planning principles.[21]San Jose is located at 372007N 1215331W / 37.335278N 121.891944W / 37.335278; -121.891944. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 180.0 square miles (466km2), of which 3.4square miles (8.9km; 1.91%) is water.San Jose lies between the San Andreas Fault, the source of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, and the Calaveras Fault. San Jose is shaken by moderate earthquakes, above four on the Richter Scale, on average of one to two times a year. These quakes originate just east of the city on the creeping section of the Calaveras Fault, which is a major source of earthquake activity in Northern California. On April 14, 1984, at 1:15pm, local time a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck the Calaveras Fault near San Jose's Mount Hamilton.[22] The most serious earthquake, in 1906, damaged many buildings in San Jose as described earlier. Earlier significant quakes rocked the city in 1839, 1851, 1858, 1864, 1865, 1868, and 1891.[citation needed] The Daly City Earthquake of 1957 caused some damage. The Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 also did some damage to parts of the city. The other faults near San Jose are the Monte Vista Fault and the Hayward Fault Zone.The Guadalupe River runs from the Santa Cruz Mountains (which separate the South Bay from the Pacific Coast) flowing north through San Jose, ending in the San Francisco Bay at Alviso. Along the southern part of the river is the neighborhood of Almaden Valley, originally named for the mercury mines which produced mercury needed for gold extraction from quartz during the California Gold Rush as well as mercury fulminate blasting caps and detonators for the U.S. military from 1870 to 1945.[23] East of the Guadalupe River, Coyote Creek also flows to south San Francisco Bay and originates on Mount Sizer near Henry W. Coe State Park and the surrounding hills in the Diablo Range, northeast of Morgan Hill, California.The lowest point in San Jose is 13feet (4m) below sea level at the San Francisco Bay in Alviso;[24] the highest is 2,125 feet.[25] Due to the proximity to Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton, San Jose has taken several steps to reduce light pollution, including replacing all street lamps and outdoor lighting in private developments with low pressure sodium lamps.[26] To recognize the city's efforts, the asteroid 6216 San Jose was named after the city.[27]San Jose lies close to the Pacific Ocean and close to San Francisco Bay (a small portion of its northern border touches the bay). Santa Clara Valley is the population center of the Bay Area, and like the hub and spokes of a wheel, surrounding communities emanate outwards from the valley. This growth in part, has shaped the greater Bay Area as it is today in terms of geographic population distribution and the trend of suburbanization away from the valley.There are four distinct valleys in the city of San Jose: Almaden Valley, situated on the south-west fringe of the city; Evergreen Valley to the south-east, which is hilly all throughout its interior; Santa Clara Valley, which includes the flat, main urban expanse of the South Bay; and the rural Coyote Valley, to the city's extreme southern fringe.San Jose, like most of the Bay Area, has a Subtropical Mediterranean climate.[28] San Jose has 300+ days of sunshine and an average daily high temperature of 73 F (23C) annually. Although San Jose lies inland and does not front the Pacific Ocean like San Francisco, it is surrounded on three sides by mountains. Because of this, the city is somewhat more sheltered from rain, giving it a semiarid feel with a mean annual rainfall of 14.4inches (366mm), compared to some other parts of the Bay Area, which can get about three times that amount.January's average high is 59 F (15C) and average low is 42 F (6C). July's average high is 84 F (29C) and average low is 57 F (14C).[29] The highest temperature ever recorded in San Jose was 114 F (46C) in June 1961; the lowest was 20 F (7C) in December 1990. Temperature fluctuations between night and day can vary as little as 10 F to 12 F (a fluctuation range of 5.5 C to 6.6 C), meaning that its climate does not experience huge temperature drops or rises like some other parts of California.With the light rainfall, San Jose and its suburbs experience about 300 full or partly sunny days a year. Rain occurs primarily in the months from November through April or May. During the winter and spring, hillsides and fields turn green with grasses and vegetation, although deciduous trees are few. With the coming of the annual hot summer dry period, the vegetation dies and dries, giving the hills a golden cover, which unfortunately also provides fuel for frequent grass fires.Measurable precipitation falls in downtown San Jose on an average of 58days a year. Annual precipitation has ranged from 6.12 inches (155mm) in 1953 to 32.57 inches (827mm) in 1983. The most precipitation in one month was 10.23 inches (260mm) in February 1998. The maximum 24-hour rainfall was 3.60 inches (91mm) on January 30, 1968. Although summer is normally quite dry in San Jose, a very heavy thunderstorm on August 21, 1968, brought 1.92-inch (49mm) of rain, causing some flooding.[30]The snow level drops as low as 2,000feet (610m) above sea level, or lower, occasionally coating nearby Mount Hamilton, and less frequently the Santa Cruz Mountains, with snow that normally lasts a few days. This sometimes snarls traffic traveling on State Route 17 towards Santa Cruz. Snow rarely falls in San Jose; the most recent snow to remain on the ground was on February 5, 1976, when many residents around the city saw as much as 3inches (7.6cm) on car and roof tops. The official observation station measured only 0.5-inch (13mm) of snow.Like most of the Bay Area, San Jose is made up of dozens of microclimates. In July, for example, highs may be just 80 degrees, on average, close to the San Francisco Bay and 85 degrees, on average, in the southern and/or eastern extremes of the city. Downtown San Jose experiences the lightest rainfall in the city, while South San Jose, only 10miles (16km) distant, generally experiences more rainfall.The city is divided into several geographical regions. Many of these regions were originally unincorporated communities or separate municipalities that were later annexed by the city. The city is generally divided into the following areas: Downtown San Jose, Central, West San Jose, North San Jose, East San Jose, and South San Jose.Some well-known communities within San Jose include Downtown San Jose, Japantown, Rose Garden, Sunol-Midtown, Willow Glen, Naglee Park, Burbank, West San Jose, Winchester, Alviso, East Foothills, Alum Rock, Little Portugal, Blossom Valley, Cambrian, Almaden Valley, Silver Creek Valley, Evergreen Valley, Edenvale, Santa Teresa, Seven Trees, Coyote Valley, and Berryessa.Important landmarks in San Jose include Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose, History Park at Kelley Park, Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph, Plaza de Csar Chvez, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library, Mexican Heritage Plaza, Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, Lick Observatory, Hayes Mansion, HP Pavilion at San Jose, De Anza Hotel, San Jose Improv, San Jose Municipal Stadium, Spartan Stadium, Japantown San Jose, Winchester Mystery House, Raging Waters, Circle of Palms Plaza, San Jose City Hall, San Jose Flea Market Oak Hill Memorial Park, and The Tech Museum of Innovation.De Anza HotelHP Pavilion at San JoseCathedral Basilica of Saint JosephLick ObservatoryMount HamiltonHayes MansionPlaza de Csar ChvezRosicrucian Egyptian MuseumWinchester Mystery HouseKelley ParkDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. LibrarySan Jose City HallFairmont San Jose HotelCircle of Palms PlazaSpartan StadiumThe 2010 United States Census[37] reported that San Jose had a population of 945,942. The population density was 5,256.2 people per square mile (2,029.4/km). The racial makeup of San Jose was 404,437 (42.8%) White, 303,138 (32.0%) Asian (10.4% Vietnamese, 6.7% Chinese, 5.6% Filipino, 4.6% Indian, 1.2% Korean, 1.2% Japanese, 0.3% Cambodian, 0.2% Thai, 0.2% Pakistani, 0.2% Laotian), 30,242 (3.2%) African American, 8,297 (0.9%) Native American, 4,017 (0.4%) Pacific Islander, 148,749 (15.7%) from other races, and 47,062 (5.0%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 313,636 persons (33.2%). Among the Hispanic population, 28.2% are Mexican, 0.7% Salvadoran, 0.5% Puerto Rican, and 0.3% Nicaraguan. Non-Hispanic Whites were 28.7% of the population in 2010,[38] down from 60.4% in 1970.[16]The Census reported that 932,620 people (98.6% of the population) lived in households, 9,542 (1.0%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 3,780 (0.4%) were institutionalized.There were 301,366 households, out of which 122,958 (40.8%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 162,819 (54.0%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 37,988 (12.6%) had a female householder with no husband present, 18,702 (6.2%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 16,900 (5.6%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 2,458 (0.8%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 59,385 households (19.7%) were made up of individuals and 18,305 (6.1%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.09. There were 219,509 families (72.8% of all households); the average family size was 3.54.The population was spread out with 234,678 people (24.8%) under the age of 18, 89,457 people (9.5%) aged 18 to 24, 294,399 people (31.1%) aged 25 to 44, 232,166 people (24.5%) aged 45 to 64, and 95,242 people (10.1%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35.2 years. For every 100 females there were 101.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 99.8 males.There were 314,038 housing units at an average density of 1,745.0 per square mile (673.7/km), of which 176,216 (58.5%) were owner-occupied, and 125,150 (41.5%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 1.6%; the rental vacancy rate was 4.3%. 553,436 people (58.5% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 379,184 people (40.1%) lived in rental housing units.As of the census[39] of 2000, there were 894,943 people, 276,598 households, and 203,576 families residing in the city.The population density was 5,117.9 people per square mile (1,976.1/km). There were 281,841 housing units at an average density of 1,611.8 per square mile (622.3/km). Of the 276,598 households, 38.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.0% were married couples living together, 11.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 26.4% were non-families. 18.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 4.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.20 and the average family size was 3.62.In the city the population was spread out with 26.4% under the age of 18, 9.9% from 18 to 24, 35.4% from 25 to 44, 20.0% from 45 to 64, and 8.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females there were 103.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.5 males.According to a 2007 estimate, the median income for a household in the city was the highest in the U.S. for any city with more than a quarter million residents with $76,963 annually. The median income for a family was $86,822.[40] Males had a median income of $49,347 versus $36,936 for females. The per capita income for the city was $26,697. About 6.0% of families and 8.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.3% of those under age 18 and 7.4% of those age 65 or over.San Jose and the rest of the Bay Area is home to many Christian congregations, including large Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, Mormons, and Jehovah's Witnesses, alongside centers of Jewish, Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist and Sikh faiths, among numerous other religious communities.A high percentage of foreign-born residents (39.0% of the population) live in the city. These include many high-tech workers from East and South Asia, Eastern European immigrants, as well as poorer immigrants from Latin America, many of whom can be found in the large, multi-generational barrio Alum Rock district. San Jose has the largest Vietnamese population of any city in the world outside of Vietnam.[41] The people from these countries have settled in the city and across the Santa Clara Valley primarily during the last three or four decades.The large concentration of high-technology engineering, computer, and microprocessor companies around San Jose has led the area to be known as Silicon Valley. As the largest city in the valley, San Jose has billed itself "the capital of Silicon Valley." Area schools such as the University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Santa Cruz, San Jose State University, San Francisco State University, California State University, East Bay, Santa Clara University, and Stanford University pump thousands of engineering and computer science graduates into the local economy every year.High economic growth during the tech bubble caused employment, housing prices, and traffic congestion to peak in the late 1990s. As the economy slowed in the early 2000s, employment and traffic congestion diminished somewhat. In the mid-2000s, traffic along major highways again began to worsen as the economy improved. San Jose had 405,000 jobs within its city limits in 2006, and an unemployment rate of 4.6%. In 2000, San Jose residents had the highest median household income of any city in the United States with a population over 300,000, and currently has the highest median income of any U.S. city with over 280,000 people.San Jose lists many companies with 1,000 employees or more, including the headquarters of Adobe, Altera, Brocade Communications Systems, Cadence Design Systems, Cisco Systems, eBay, Lee's Sandwiches, Sanmina-SCI, and Xilinx, as well as major facilities for Becton Dickinson, Ericsson, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, IBM, Kaiser Permanente and KLA Tencor. Other large companies based in San Jose include Altera, Atmel, CEVA, Cypress Semiconductor, Echelon, Integrated Device Technology, Micrel, Netgear, Novellus Systems, Oclaro, Online Trading Academy, Quantum, SunPower, Supermicro, Tessera Technologies, TiVo, Ultratech, and VeriFone. Sizable government employers include the city government, Santa Clara County, and San Jose State University.[42] Acer's United States division has its offices in San Jose.[43] Prior to its closing, Netcom had its headquarters in San Jose.[44][45]The cost of living in San Jose and the surrounding areas is among the highest in California and the nation.[46] Housing costs are the primary reason for the high cost of living, although the costs in all areas tracked by the ACCRA Cost of Living Index are above the national average. Despite the high cost of living in San Jose, households in city limits have the highest disposable income of any city in the U.S. with over 500,000 residents.[47][48]San Jose residents produce more U.S. patents than any other city.[49] Thirty-five percent of all venture capital funds in the U.S. are invested in San Jose and Silicon Valley companies.[49]As of December 2011, the top employers in the city are:San Jose is a charter city under California law, giving it the power to enact local ordinances that may conflict with state law, within the limits provided by the charter.[50] The city has a council-manager government with a city manager nominated by the mayor and elected by the city council.The San Jose City Council is made up of ten council members elected by districts, and a mayor elected by the entire city. During city council meetings, the mayor presides, and all eleven members can vote on any issue. The mayor has no veto powers. Council members and the mayor are elected to four-year terms; the even-numbered district council members beginning in 1994; the mayor and the odd-numbered district council members beginning in 1996.[51]Council members and the mayor are limited to two successive terms in office, although a council member that has reached the term limit can be elected mayor, and vice versa. The council elects a vice-mayor from the members of the council at the second meeting of the year following a council election. This council member acts as mayor during the temporary absence of the mayor, but does not succeed to the mayor's office upon a vacancy.[51]The City Manager is the chief administrative officer of the city, and must present an annual budget for approval by the city council. When the office is vacant, the Mayor proposes a candidate for City Manager, subject to council approval. The council appoints the Manager for an indefinite term, and may at any time remove the manager, or the electorate may remove the manager through a recall election. Other city officers appointed by the council are the City Attorney, City Auditor, City Clerk, and Independent Police Auditor.[51]and like all cities and counties in the state, San Jose has representation in the state legislature.Like all California cities except San Francisco, both the levels and the boundaries of what the city government controls are determined by the local county Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO).[52] The goal of a LAFCO is to try to avoid uncontrolled urban sprawl. The Santa Clara County LAFCO has set boundaries of San Jose's "Sphere of Influence" (indicated by the blue line in the map near the top of the page) as a superset of the actual city limits (the yellow area in the map), plus parts of the surrounding unincorporated county land, where San Jose can, for example, prevent development of fringe areas to concentrate city growth closer to the city's core. The LAFCO also defines a subset of the Sphere as an 'Urban Service Area' (indicated by the red line in the map), effectively limiting development to areas where urban infrastructure (sewers, electrical service, etc.) already exists.San Jose is the county seat of Santa Clara County.[53] Accordingly, many county government facilities are located in the city, including the office of the County Executive, the Board of Supervisors, the District Attorney's Office, eight courthouses of the Superior Court, the Sheriff's Office, and the County Clerk.[54]San Jose is located in the 10th, 11th, 13th, and 15th Senate Districts, represented by Democrats Ellen Corbett, Joe Simitian, and Elaine Alquist, and Republican Abel Maldonado respectively, and in the 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 27th, and 28th Assembly districts, represented by Democrats Bob Wieckowski, Rich Gordon, Paul Fong, Nora Campos, Jim Beall, Bill Monning, and Anna M. Caballero respectively. Federally, San Jose is located in California's 14th, 15th, and 16th congressional districts, which have Cook PVIs of D +18, D +14, and D +16 respectively,[55] and are represented by Democrats Anna Eshoo, Mike Honda, and Zoe Lofgren respectively.Several state and federal agencies maintain offices in San Jose. The city is the location of the Sixth District of the California Courts of Appeal.[56] It is also home to one of three courthouses of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, the other two being in Oakland and San Francisco.[57]Crime in San Jose has been, and continues to be lower than in other large American cities.[58] Like most large cities crime levels have fallen significantly after rising in the 1980s.[58] Today it is ranked as one of the safest cities in the country with a population over 500,000 people.[59][60][61] The designation is based on crime statistics reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in six categories: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and auto theft. As of 2009, the city had the second lowest violent crime rate of any city with 500,000 or more residents, second only to Honolulu.[58] However in 2011, homicides have surged surpassing 2010's number of homicides which was 20 and in 2011 was 39.[62]Current mayor Chuck Reed is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition,[63] an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino.The Office of Economic Development coordinates the San Jose Sister City Program which is part of Sister Cities International. As of 2008, there are seven sister cities:[64]Because the downtown area is in the flight path to nearby Mineta San Jose International Airport (also evidenced in the above panoramic), there is a height limit for buildings in the downtown area, which is under the final approach corridor to the airport. The height limit is dictated by local ordinances, driven by the distance from the runway and a slope defined by Federal Aviation Administration regulations. Core downtown buildings are limited to approximately 300 feet (91m) but can get taller farther from the airport.[66]There has been broad criticism over the past few decades of the city's architecture.[67] Citizens have complained that San Jose is lacking in aesthetically pleasing architectural styles. Blame for this lack of architectural "beauty" can be assigned to the re-development of the downtown area from the 1950s onward, in which whole blocks of historic commercial and residential structures were demolished.[68] Exceptions to this include the Downtown Historic District, the De Anza Hotel, and the Hotel Sainte Claire, both of which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places for their architectural and historical significance.Municipal building projects have experimented more with architectural styles than have most private enterprises.[69] The Children's Discovery Museum, Tech Museum of Innovation, and the San Jose Repertory Theater building have experimented with bold colors and unusual exteriors. The new City Hall, designed by Richard Meier & Partners opened in 2005 and is a notable addition to the growing collection of municipal building projects.[70]Public art is an evolving attraction in the city. The city was one of the first to adopt a public art ordinance at 2% of capital improvement building project budgets,[71] and the results of this commitment are beginning to have an impact on the visual landscape of the city. There are a considerable number of public art projects throughout the downtown area, and a growing collection in the newer civic locations in neighborhoods including libraries, parks, and fire stations. Of particular note, the Mineta Airport expansion is incorporating a program of Art & Technology into its development.Within the early efforts at public art, there are notable controversies. Two examples include the statue of Quetzalcoatl (the plumed serpent) in downtown which was controversial in its planning because some religious groups felt that it was pagan, and controversial in its implementation because many felt that the final statue by Robert Graham did not closely resemble a winged serpent, and was more noted for its expense than its aesthetics. This has resulted in locals joking that the statue resembles a pile of feces.[72]The statue of Thomas Fallon also met strong resistance from those who felt that people like him were largely responsible for the decimation of early native populations and Chicano/Latino activists protested he captured San Jose by violent force in the Mexican-American war (1846) as well "repressed" historic documents of Fallon ordered the expulsion of most of the city's Californio (early Spanish or Mexican) residents. In October 1991 after protests in part of Columbus Day and Dia de la Raza celebrations, the Fallon statue plan was scrapped and the statue was stored in a warehouse in Oakland for more than a decade. The statue was returned to public display in 2002, albeit in a less conspicuous location: Pellier Park, a small triangular patch formed by the merge of West Julian and West St. James streets.[73]In 2001, the city sponsored SharkByte, an exhibit of decorated sharks, based on the mascot of the hockey team, the San Jose Sharks, and modeled after Chicago's display of decorated cows.[74] Large models of sharks were decorated in a variety of clever, colorful, or creative ways by local artists and were then displayed for months at dozens of locations around the city. Many displays were removed early because of vandalism. After the exhibition, the sharks were auctioned off and the proceeds donated to charity. The sharks can still be found in their new owners' homes and businesses.In 2006, Adobe Systems commissioned an art installation titled San Jose Semaphore by Ben Rubin,[75] which is located at the top of its headquarters building. Semaphore is composed of four LED discs which "rotate" to transmit a message. The content of the San Jose Semaphores message remained a mystery until it was deciphered in August 2007.[76] The visual art installation is supplemented with an audio track, transmitted from the building on a low-power AM station. The audio track provides clues to decode the message being transmitted.The city is home to many performing arts companies, including Opera San Jose, Symphony Silicon Valley, Ballet San Jose Silicon Valley, Children's Musical Theater of San Jose (recognized as the largest and most talented youth theatre company in the nation), the San Jose Youth Symphony, the San Jose Repertory Theatre, City Lights Theatre Company, The Tabard Theatre Company, San Jose Stage Company, and the now-defunct American Musical Theatre of San Jose which was replaced by Broadway San Jose in partnership with Team San Jose. San Jose also is home to the San Jose Museum of Art,[77] one of the nation's premiere Modern Art museums. The annual Cinequest Film Festival in downtown has grown to over 60,000 attendees per year, becoming an important festival for independent films. The San Francisco Asian American Film Festival is an annual event, which is hosted in San Francisco, Berkeley, and Downtown San Jose. Approximately 30 to 40 films are screened in San Jose each year at the Camera 12 Downtown Cinemas. The San Jose Jazz Festival is another of many great events hosted throughout the year.The HP Pavilion at San Jose is one of the most active venues for events in the world. According to Billboard Magazine and Pollstar, the arena sold the most tickets to non-sporting events of any venue in the United States, and third in the world after the Manchester Evening News Arena in Manchester, England, and the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, for the period from January 1 September 30, 2004. Including sporting events, the HP Pavilion averages 184 events a year, or roughly one event for every two days, which is significantly higher than the average for NHL arenas..San Jose was able to have at least one major sports league franchise, the San Jose Sharks of the NHL, but the city tried to obtain a NBA basketball and Major League Baseball team before. The UFL of American football held the San Jose/California Redwoods team in 2009-10, but has relocated to Sacramento to become the Sacramento Mountain Lions the following year. San Jose was a founding member of both the California League and Pacific Coast Leagues, in minor league baseball, but currently the San Jose Giants of the class-A Cal League under the affiliation of the San Francisco Giants could move to the triple-A level PCL. The independent North American League formerly the Golden Baseball League held an interest in the Santa Clara Valley, most notably to have a team in Santa Clara where the city tried to catch the Giants and Oakland A's, and the NFL San Francisco 49ers in a rejected major league sports stadium proposal.In 2004, the San Jose Sports Authority hosted the U.S. Olympic team trials for judo, taekwondo, trampolining and rhythmic gymnastics at the San Jose State Event Center. In August 2004, the San Jose Seahawk Rugby Football Club hosted the USA All-Star 7-Aside Rugby Championships at Watson Bowl, east of Downtown. San Jose is also home to the St Joseph's Hurling Club. In 2008, around 90 percent of the members of the United States Olympic team were processed at San Jose State University prior to traveling to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[78] The 2009 Junior Olympics for trampoline also were held here. In April 2009, it was announced San Jose State will host the 2011 American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) national tournament.[79]Rail service to and within San Jose is provided by Amtrak (the SacramentoSan-Jose Capitol Corridor and the SeattleLos-Angeles Coast Starlight), Caltrain (commuter rail service between San Francisco and Gilroy), ACE (commuter rail service to Pleasanton and Stockton), and a local light-rail system connecting downtown to Mountain View, Milpitas, Campbell, and Almaden Valley, operated by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA). Historic streetcars from History Park operate on the light rail lines in downtown during holidays. Long-term plans call for BART to be expanded to Santa Clara through Milpitas and San Jose from the current terminal in Fremont. Originally, the extension was to be built all at once, but due to the recession, sales tax revenue has dramatically decreased. Because of this, the extension will be built in two phases. Phase 1 will extend service to a temporary terminal in north-eastern San Jose in 2018 at Berryessa station. Construction has been approved and funded and will begin in Summer 2012 and connect with the Warm Springs extension to southern Fremont. In addition, San Jose will be a major stop on the future California High Speed Rail route between Los Angeles and San Francisco.[80] Diridon Station (formerly Cahill Depot, 65 Cahill Street) is the meeting point of all regional commuter rail service in the area. It was built in 1935 by the Southern Pacific Railroad, and was refurbished in 1994.VTA also operates many bus routes in San Jose and the surrounding communities, as well as offering paratransit services to local residents. Additionally, the Highway 17 Express bus line connects central San Jose with Santa Cruz.San Jose is served by Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport (IATA: SJC,ICAO: KSJC,FAA LID: SJC), two miles (3km) northwest of downtown, and by Reid-Hillview Airport of Santa Clara County (ICAO: KRHV,FAA LID: RHV) a general aviation airport located in the eastern part of San Jose. San Jose residents also use San Francisco International Airport (IATA: SFO,ICAO: KSFO,FAA LID: SFO), a major international hub located 35miles (56km) to the northwest, and Oakland International Airport (IATA: OAK,ICAO: KOAK,FAA LID: OAK), another major international airport located 35miles (56km) to the north. The airport is also near the intersections of three major freeways, U.S. Route 101, Interstate 880, and State Route 87.The San Jose area has a large freeway system, including three Interstate freeways and one U.S. Route. It is, however, the largest city in the country not served by a primary Interstate; most of the Interstate Highway Network was planned by the early 1950s well before San Jose's rapid growth decades later.U.S. 101 runs south to the California Central Coast and Los Angeles, and then runs north up near the eastern shore of the San Francisco Peninsula to San Francisco. I-280 also heads to San Francisco, but goes along just to the west of the cities of San Francisco Peninsula. I-880 heads north to Oakland, running parallel to the southeastern shore of San Francisco Bay. I-680 parallels I-880 to Fremont, but then cuts northeast to the eastern cities of the San Francisco Bay Area.Several state highways also serve San Jose: SR 17, SR 85, SR 87 and SR 237. Additionally, San Jose is served by a system of county-wide expressways, which includes the Almaden Expressway, Capitol Expressway, San Tomas Expressway, and Lawrence Expressway.Several regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to deal with congestion on San Jose freeways. This includes expansion of State Route 87 including more lanes near the downtown San Jose area. The interchange for I-280 connecting with I-680 and US 101, a rush-hour spot where the three freeways meet has been known to have high-density traffic similar to Los Angeles County interchanges.A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked San Jose the nineteenth most walkable of fifty largest cities in the United States.[81]Potable water is provided primarily by the private-sector San Jose Water Company, with some by the Great Oaks Water Company, and ten percent by the public-sector San Jose Municipal Water System. Great Oaks provides exclusively well water[citation needed], while the other two provide water from multiple sources[citation needed], including well water, and surface water from the Los Gatos Creek watershed, Santa Clara Valley Water District, and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission's Hetch Hetchy Reservoir.Garbage, wastewater treatment, and recycling services are overseen by the city of San Jose's Environmental Services Department. San Jose recycles 64% of its waste, an exceptionally high percentage that is attributed to the recycling program's accepting an unusually long list of recyclable items without requiring that materials be sorted.[82] Among the items accepted are all types of plastic, aerosol cans and paint cans, foam packing materials, aluminum furniture, small metal appliances, pots and pans, and clean fabrics.Wastewater treatment happens at the San Jose/Santa Clara Water Pollution Control Plant, which treats and cleans the wastewater of more than 1,500,000 people that live and work in the 300+ square mile (780km) area encompassing San Jose, Santa Clara, Milpitas, Campbell, Cupertino, Los Gatos, Saratoga, and Monte Sereno.[82]About ten percent of the treated wastewater is sold for irrigation ("water recycling") in San Jose[citation needed], Santa Clara, and Milpitas, through local water providers San Jose Municipal Water System, City of Milpitas Municipal Services, City of Santa Clara Water & Sewer Utility, Santa Clara Valley Water District, San Jose Water Company, and Great Oaks Water Company.PG&E provides residents natural gas and electricity service. Telephone communications are provided primarily by AT&T, and cable television is provided by Comcast. Internet services are provided by several companies, but primarily by Comcast and AT&T.San Jose is home to several colleges and universities. The largest is San Jose State University, which was founded by the California legislature in 1862 as the California State Normal School, and is the founding campus of the California State University (CSU) system. Located in downtown San Jose since 1870, the university enrolls approximately 30,000 students in over 130 different bachelor's and master's degree programs. The school enjoys a good academic reputation, especially in the fields of engineering, business, art and design, and journalism, and consistently ranks among the top public universities in the western region of the United States.[83] San Jose State is one of only three Bay Area schools that fields a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Division I college football team; Stanford University and U.C. Berkeley are the other two.National Hispanic University, with an enrollment of 600, offers associate and bachelor's degrees and teaching credentials to its students, focusing on Hispanic students.California University of Management and Technology (CALMAT) offers many degree programs, including MBA, Computer Science, Information Technology. Most classes are offered both online and in the downtown campus. Many of the students are working professionals in the Silicon Valley.Lincoln Law School of San Jose and University of Silicon Valley Law School offer law degrees, catering to working professionals.National University maintains a campus in San Jose.The San Jose campus of Golden Gate University offers business bachelor and MBA degrees.San Jose's community colleges, San Jose City College, West Valley College, Mission College and Evergreen Valley College, offer associate degrees, general education units to transfer to CSU and UC schools, and adult and continuing education programs. The West campus of Palmer College of Chiropractic is also located in San Jose.WestMed College is headquartered in San Jose and offers paramedic training, emergency medical technician training, and licensed vocational nursing programs.The University of California, Santa Cruz operates Lick Observatory atop Mount Hamilton.Additionally, San Jose residents attend several other area universities, including Santa Clara University, Stanford University in Palo Alto, Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley in Mountain View and the University of California, Berkeley. San Jose and South Bay residents also comprise large proportions of the student bodies at major California public universities, including UC Santa Cruz, UC Davis, UC San Diego, and UC Riverside.Up until the opening of Lincoln High School in 1943, San Jose students only attended San Jose High School. Some of the city's history is embedded within these two high schools, which hold a Thanksgiving Day high school football game, called the "Big Bone." As of 2010, there are 127 elementary, 47 middle, and 44 high schools, of which are all public. Public education in the city is provided by four high school districts, fourteen elementary districts, and four unified school districts (which provide both elementary and high schools).In addition to the main San Jose Unified School District (SJUSD), other nearby unified school districts of nearby cities are Milpitas Unified School District, Morgan Hill Unified School District, and Santa Clara Unified School District.Districts using the "feeder" system:Prior to 1954, California law required cities and school districts to have the same boundaries. When San Jose began expanding, rural school districts became one of the major opponents, as their territory and tax base was taken by the city. The city's legislators pushed a bill through the California Legislature, removing that requirement, and ending much of the opposition. The result is a patchwork of local school districts in the areas annexed after 1954.[17]Private schools in San Jose are primarily run by religious groups. The Catholic Diocese of San Jose has the second largest student population in the Santa Clara County, behind only SJUSD; the diocese and its parishes operate several schools in the city, including six high schools: Archbishop Mitty High School, Bellarmine College Preparatory, Notre Dame High School, Saint Francis High School, St. Lawrence High School, and Presentation High School.[84] Other private high schools not run by the Diocese include two Baptist high schools, Liberty Baptist School and White Road Baptist Academy, one Non-Denominational Protestant high school, Valley Christian High School (San Jose, California), and a nonsectarian K-12 Harker School west of the city in the Blackford neighborhood.The San Jose Public Library system is unique in that the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Library combines the collections of the city's system with the San Jose State University main library. In 2003, construction of the library, which now holds more than 1.6million items, was the largest single library construction project west of the Mississippi, with eight floors that result in more than 475,000 square feet (44,100m2) of space with a capacity for 2million volumes.[85]The city has 21 neighborhood branches (17 of them open and not currently undergoing renovation or reconstruction) including the Biblioteca Latinoamericana which specializes in Spanish language works.[86] The East San Jose Carnegie Branch Library, a Carnegie library opened in 1908, is the last Carnegie library in Santa Clara County still operating as a public library and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As the result of a bond measure passed in November 2000, a number of brand new or completely reconstructed branches have been completed and opened. The four branches currently undergoing construction are the Calabazas Branch, the Educational Park Branch, the Seventrees Branch, and the Bascom Branch and Community Center. The yet-to-be-named brand new Southeast Branch is also planned, bringing the bond library project to its completion.[87]The San Jose system (along with the University system) were jointly named as "Library of the Year" by the Library Journal in 2004.[88]Early written documents record the local presence of migrating salmon in the 'Rio Guadalupe' dating as far back as the 18th century.[90] Both steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and King salmon are extant in the Guadalupe River, making San Jose the southernmost major U. S. city with known salmon spawning runs, the other cities being Anchorage, Alaska; Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon and Sacramento, California.[91] Runs of up to 1,000 Chinook or King Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) swam up the Guadalupe River each fall in the 1990s, but have all but vanished in the current decade apparently blocked from access to breeding grounds by impassable culverts, weirs and wide, exposed and flat concrete paved channels installed by the Santa Clara Valley Water District.[92] In 2011 a small number of Chinook salmon were filmed spawning under the Julian Street bridge.[93]San Jose's trail network offers over 53 miles (90km) of recreational and commute trails throughout the City.[94] The major trails in the network include:This large urban trail network, recognized by Prevention Magazine as the nation's largest, is linked to trails in surrounding jurisdictions and many rural trails in surrounding open space and foothills.San Jose is served by Greater Bay Area media. Print media outlets in San Jose include the San Jose Mercury News, the weekly Metro Silicon Valley, El Observador and the Silicon Valley / San Jose Business Journal. Broadcasters include 34 television stations, 25 AM radio stations, and 55 FM radio stations.[95]In April 1909, Charles David Herrold, an electronics instructor in San Jose, constructed a radio station to broadcast the human voice. The station "San Jose Calling" (call letters FN, later FQW), was the world's first radio station with scheduled programming targeted at a general audience. The station became the first to broadcast music in 1910. Herrold's wife Sybil became the first female "disk jockey" in 1912. The station changed hands a number of times before eventually becoming today's KCBS in San Francisco.[96] Therefore KCBS technically is the oldest radio station in the United States, and celebrated their 100th anniversary in 2009 with much fanfare.Ellen CorbettJoe SimitianElaine AlquistSam BlakesleeRich GordonSally J.

GMA News and Public Affairs (commonly GMA News; formerly RBS News Department, GMA Radio-Television News and GMA Rainbow Satellite News) is the news department of the Philippine broadcaster GMA Network and its sister network GMA News TV. It produces news and infotainment programs for all GMA Network owned and affiliated television and radio stations in the Philippines, and internationally through GMA Pinoy TV and GMA Life TV. GMA News and Public Affairs is currently headed by Marissa Flores. It is headquartered at the Ground Floor of GMA Network Center in Quezon City.[1]The GMA News division traces its origin from the Republic Broadcasting System, established by Robert Stewart in 1959. Programming of its radio station, DZBB depended on mostly on news reports. The station covered the eruption of Mt. Hibok-Hibok in 1951, and the election and death of former President Ramon Magsaysay. While RBS Channel 7 was established in 1961, it was in 1970s that GMA became one of the most-watched television news source in the country. In 1983, Channel 7 was the first to break the news of Ninoy Aquino's death, and later would be the only television station to broadcast his funeral. The channel also became the first station to broadcast the Ramos-Enrile break-away that led to the People Power Revolt.In 1998, GMA teamed up with the Philippine Daily Inquirer to produce election coverage. Its flagship newscast, Saksi, won the 1999 Asian Television Awards and 2002 New York Festival awards for Best Newscast. In 2006, GMA News was praised by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo for its news coverage, and said that it was the reason for the network's high ratings. In the 2006 SWS Media Trust survey, GMA News garnered 60% of public trust, second only to rival ABS-CBN with 68%. But a similar Pulse Asia survey shows that GMA News is the more credible in the country and to key demographics. [1]GMA News became a pioneer in local television news in many ways. GMA was one of the pioneers of women in broadcast journalism. Tina Monzon-Palma was one of the first women co-anchors when she first presented News at Seven, one of the most-watched news programs in the 1970s and . Helen Vela was the first woman to anchor news in Tagalog for GMA Balita, and Mel Tiangco was the first late-night solo anchor for Frontpage. GMA was the first to broadcast an hourly news program, GMA News Live which is known today as the GMA Flash Report, and the first station to use a ticker for breaking news and traffic information. GMA News was also the first to use Electronic News Gathering Vans in the country in 1995. In 2004, it regularly began to use Satellite News Gathering facilities to reach more remote areas. It also covered major events in the country, such as the 1995 World Youth Day, 2003 World Meeting of Families, and 2000 Today.In celebration of the 50th Anniversary, GMA airs Limang Dekada: The GMA News 50th Anniversary Special on January 10, 2010 on GMA and January 31, 2010 on Q.GMAs Public Affairs division was established in 1987[2] when Tina Monzon-Palma, then head of GMA News recognized that a 30 minute newscast was not adequate and sufficient to inform the general Filipino public on what is happening to the recently established Aquino government after the historic People Power Revolution[3] in February 1986.[4] It started with five news personnel including Marissa La Torre Flores (now handles GMA News and Public Affairs as senior vice president) and held office inside the cameramens locker room before moving into the state-of-the-art GMA Network Center with no experience, equipment, camera and an improvised set broadcasting at the old GMA building in Edsa with only a passion to work attitude. Now with more than 500 news personnelhere and abroadand producing 16 of the most awarded programs on Philippine television today.The public affairs program Weekend With Velez, was the first network-produced program on GMA, afterward renamed to Velez This Week and was hosted by Jose Mari Velez. Later that year it was joined with other public affairs shows such as Firing Line with Teddy Benigno (later on hosted by Oscar Orbos); View Point with Dong Puno; Straight from the Shoulder hosted by Louie Beltran and The Probe Team by Che-Che Lazaro and Issues and Answers hosted by Art Borjal.From a makeshift and improvised set, the once GMA News garnered several honors and recognitions from local and international award-giving bodies, including two gold medals in the New York Festivals and their first Peabody Award in 1999,[5] one of the most distinguished merit in the broadcast industry, the only one awarded to an Asian country. The first Peabody was given for Kidney for Sale, an investigative work on the selling of kidneys in a depressed area along the coast of Manila Bay. The award also recognizes Marissa Flores as the executive producer and a team of producers, writers, directors and reporters, as well as Jessica Soho, Michelle Seva-Recto, Jay Taruc, Leogarda Sanchez and Rowel Cornejo, Melchor Quintos and Gregg Gonzales.When longest-running noontime show Eat Bulaga! celebrated its silver anniversary in 2004, Public Affairs co-produced Eat Bulaga history with noontime show's production company Television and Production Exponents, Inc. or TAPE, Inc., because one of News and Public Affairs personalities Mr. Arnold Clavio was a contestant in a former segment of noontime show. He hosted it and was co-hosted by his Unang Hirit co-host, Ms. Rhea Santos.Coinciding with its 20th anniversary in broadcasting excellence, GMA News and Public Affairs aired a documentary entitled 20: Dalawampung Taon ng GMA Public Affairs (20: Twenty Years of GMA Public Affairs) on October 28, 2007.[6]In 2010, The I-Witness won the George peabody award. The show is the documentary of Kara David.On December 9, 2003 the Philippine House of Representatives 12th Congress commended GMA News and Public Affairs through Resolution 787[7] authored by Rep. Rodolfo Plaza for its efforts in uplifting the standards of the Philippine broadcast industry by receiving the first Peabody Award gold medal for television news awarded to an Asian country in 1999.[8]1 History

Music education is a field of study associated with the teaching and learning of music. It touches on all domains of learning, including the psychomotor domain (the development of skills), the cognitive domain (the acquisition of knowledge), and, in particular and significant ways, the affective domain, including music appreciation and sensitivity. The incorporation of music training from preschool to postsecondary education is common in most nations because involvement in music is considered a fundamental component of human culture and behavior. Music, like language, is an accomplishment that distinguishes us as humans.[1]In Elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as keyboards or recorders, sing in small choirs, and learn about the elements of musical sound and history of music. Although music education in many nations has traditionally emphasized Western classical music, in recent decades music educators tend to incorporate application and history of non-western music to give a well-rounded musical experience and teach multiculturalism and international understanding. In primary and secondary schools, students may often have the opportunity to perform in some type of musical ensemble, such as a choir, orchestra, or school band: concert band, marching band, or jazz band. In some secondary schools, additional music classes may also be available. In junior high school or its equivalent, music usually continues to be a required part of the curriculum.[2]At the university level, students in most arts and humanities programs may receive academic credit for taking music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the history of music, or a music appreciation course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some type of music ensemble in which students from various fields of study may participate such as a choir, concert band, marching band, or orchestra. Many universities also offer degree programs in the field of music education, allowing their students to become certified educators of primary and secondary school ensembles as well as beginner music classes. Advanced degrees can lead to university employment. These degrees come with the completion of varied technique classes, private instruction, numerous ensembles, and in depth observations of educators in the area. Music education departments in North American and European universities also often support interdisciplinary research in such areas as music psychology, music education historiography, educational ethnomusicology, sociomusicology, and philosophy of education.The study of Western art music is increasingly common in music education outside of North America and Europe, including Asian nations such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the music of Africa or Bali (e.g. Gamelan music), as well as even rock music (see popular music pedagogy).Music education also takes place in individualized, lifelong learning, and community contexts. Both amateur and professional musicians typically take music lessons, short private sessions with an individual teacher. Amateur musicians typically take lessons to learn musical rudiments and beginner- to intermediate-level musical techniques.While instructional strategies are bound by the music teacher and the music curriculum in his or her area, many teachers rely heavily on one of many instructional methodologies that emerged in recent generations and developed rapidly during the latter half of the 20th Century:The Dalcroze method was developed in the early 20th century by Swiss musician and educator mile Jaques-Dalcroze. The method is divided into three fundamental concepts - the use of solfge, improvisation, and eurhythmics. Sometimes referred to as "rhythmic gymnastics", eurhythmics teaches concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, and is the concept for which Dalcroze is best known. It focuses on allowing the student to gain physical awareness and experience of music through training that takes place through all of the senses, particularly kinesthetic. According to the Dalcroze method, music is the fundamental language of the human brain and therefore deeply connected to what human beings are.Zoltn Kodly (18821967) was a prominent Hungarian music educator and composer who stressed the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. Although not really an educational method, his teachings reside within a fun, educational framework built on a solid grasp of basic music theory and music notation in various verbal and written forms. Kodly's primary goal was to instill a lifelong love of music in his students and felt that it was the duty of the child's school to provide this vital element of education. Some of Kodly's trademark teaching methods include the use of solfge hand signs, musical shorthand notation (stick notation), and rhythm solmization (verbalization). Even though most countries have properly used their own folk music traditions to construct their own sequence of instruction, America primarily uses the Hungarian sequence even though Hungarian folk music is completely different from American. The work of Katinka S. Daniel brought Kodalys ideas to the forefront of music education in the United States. Daniel introduced her curriculum to the International Kodaly Conference in 1973 and in the years that followed published works for music educators which combine Hungarian folk songs with American folk songs and western classical music. Ms. Daniel agreed with Kodaly about the appropriateness of using simple lights songs from students own culture as the basis for their music education but she was adamant that the sequence in which tonal patterns are taught should begin with the descending minor third, or sol-mi, pattern as it is the most natural and simplest interval for all children to sing in tune. Katina Daniel made the task of adapting Kodalys work to American music education less daunting for American educators. [3]Carl Orff was a prominent German composer. The Orff Schulwerk is considered an "approach" to music education. It begins with a student's innate abilities to engage in rudimentary forms of music, using basic rhythms and melodies. Orff considers the whole body a percussive instrument and students are led to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music. The approach encourages improvisation and discourages adult pressures and mechanical drill, fostering student self-discovery. Carl Orff developed a special group of instruments, including modifications of the glockenspiel, xylophone, metallophone, drum, and other percussion instruments to accommodate the requirements of the Schulwerk courses.[4]The Suzuki method was developed by Shinichi Suzuki in Japan shortly after World War II, and it uses music education to enrich the lives and moral character of its students. The movement rests on the double premise that "all children can be well educated" in music, and that learning to play music at a high level also involves learning certain character traits or virtues which make a person's soul more beautiful. The primary method for achieving this is centered around creating the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language. This 'ideal' environment includes love, high-quality examples, praise, rote training and repetition, and a time-table set by the student's developmental readiness for learning a particular technique. While the Suzuki Method is quite popular internationally, within Japan its influence is less significant than the Yamaha Method, founded by Genichi Kawakami in association with the Yamaha Music Foundation.In addition to the four major international methods described above, other approaches have been influential. Lesser-known methods are described below:This method is based on an extensive body of research and field testing by Edwin E. Gordon and others. Music Learning Theory provides the music teacher a comprehensive method for teaching musicianship through audiation, Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind with understanding. Teaching methods help music teachers establish sequential curricular objectives in accord with their own teaching styles and beliefs.[5]The growth of cultural diversity within school-age populations prompted music educators from the 1960s onward to diversify the content of the music curriculum, and to work with ethnomusicologists and some of the world's artist-musicians in establishing instructional practices relevant to the musical traditions. 'World music pedagogy' was coined by Patricia Shehan Campbell to describe world music content and practice in elementary and secondary school music programs. Pioneers of the movement, especially Barbara Reeder Lundquist and William M. Anderson, influenced a second generation of music educators (including Bryan J. Burton, Mary Goetze, Ellen McCullough-Brabson, and Mary Shamrock) to design and deliver curricular models to teachers of music of various levels and specializations.Deriving influence from both Kodly methodology and Gordon's Music Learning Theory, Conversational Solfge was developed by Dr. John M. Feierabend, chair of music education at the Hartt School at the University of Hartford. The philosophy of this method is to view music as an aural art with a literature based curriculum. The sequence of this methodology involves a 12 step process to teach music literacy. Steps include rhythm and tonal patterns and decoding the patterns using syllables and notation. Unlike traditional Kodly method, this method follows Kodly's actual instructions and uses a sequence based on American folk songs instead of using the sequence that is used in Hungary based on Hungarian folk songs.This early-childhood approach sometimes referred to as the Sensory-Motor Approach to Music was developed by the violinist Madeleine Carabo-Cone. This approach involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard. The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch.[6]The Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project was developed in 1965 and is an alternative method in shaping positive attitudes toward music education. This creative approach centers around the student being the musician and involved in the discovery process. The teacher gives the student freedom to create, perform, improvise, conduct, research, and investigate different facets of music in a spiral curriculum.Mark O'Connor developed a method of violin education,[7][8] that is designed to guide students through the development of musical techniques necessary to become a proficient violinist. The method consists of a series of pieces, that cover a wide range of genres.[9] Teacher training sessions based on the method take place around the country.During its tenure, the Mumbai-based Boss School of Music developed a proprietary method of education[10] using audio-visual technology, simplified concepts and specially designed musical equipment.[11][12] They trained novice students for standardized electronic keyboard graded examinations conducted by Trinity College London, requiring only 3-6 months of training using their methods,[13][10][14][15] which otherwise required upto 8 years of training using traditional methods.[10][13] Dr. Vidyadhar Vyas, Head of the Music Department at the University of Mumbai claimed that they "revolutionized" music learning by teaching complex musical concepts in short periods of time.[10][13][15] They also trained a few young children between ages 6 and 10 for the Grade 8 Electronic Keyboard examination conducted by Trinity College, and after they passed the examination they were reportedly considered child prodigies.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22] Although their method is not formally documented, various notable musicians in Mumbai such as Louis Banks agreed that the school had developed a "revolutionary technique".[10][12]After the preaching of Reverend Thomas Symmes, the first singing school was created in 1717 in Boston for the purposes of improving singing and music reading in the church. These singing schools gradually spread throughout the colonies. Reverend John Tufts published An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes Using Non-Traditional Notation which is regarded as the first music textbook in the colonies. Between 1700 to 1820, more than 375 tune books would be published by such authors as Samuel Holyoke, Francis Hopkinson, William Billings, and Oliver Holden.[23]Music began to spread as a curricular subject into other school districts. Soon after music expanded to all grade levels and the teaching of music reading was improved until the music curriculum grew to include several activities in addition to music reading. By the end of 1864 public school music had spread throughout the country.In 1832, Lowell Mason and George Webb formed the Boston Academy of Music with the purposes of teaching singing and theory as well as methods of teaching music. Mason published his Manuel of Instruction in 1834 which were based upon the music education works of Pestalozzian System of Education founded by Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. This handbook gradually became used by many singing school teachers. From 1837-1838, the Boston School Committee allowed Lowell Mason to teach music in the Hawes School as a demonstration. This is regarded as the first time music education was introduced to public schools in the United States. In 1838 the Boston School Committee approved the inclusion of music in the curriculum and Lowell Mason became the first recognized supervisor of elementary music. In later years Luther Whiting Mason became the Supervisor of Music in Boston and spread music education into all levels of public education (grammar, primary, and high school). During the middle of the 19th century, Boston became the model to which many other cities across the United States included and shaped their public school music education programs.[24] Music methodology for teachers as a course was first introduced in the Normal School. The concept of classroom teachers in a school that taught music under the direction of a music supervisor was the standard model for public school music education during this century. (See also: Music education in the United States)In the United States, teaching colleges with four year degree programs developed from the Normal Schools and included music. Oberlin Conservatory first offered the Bachelor of Music Education degree. Osbourne G. McCarthy, an American music educator, introduced details for studying music for credit in Chelsea High School. Notable events in the history of music education in the early 20th century also include:The following table illustrates some notable developments from this period:Music course offerings and even entire degree programs in online music education developed in the first decade of the 21st century at various institutions, and the fields of world music pedagogy and popular music pedagogy have also seen notable expansion.Standards are curricular statements used to guide educators in determining objectives for their teaching. Use of standards became a common practice in many nations during the 20th century. For much of its existence, the curriculum for music education in the United States was determined locally or by individual teachers. In recent decades there has been a significant move toward adoption of regional and/or national standards. MENC: The National Association for Music Education, created nine voluntary content standards, called the National Standards for Music Education.[1] These standards call for:Many states and school districts have adopted their own standards for music education.Washington State has piloted a classroom based performance assessment which requires 5th and higher grade students to compose music on a staff and sight sing from sheet music without the aid of instruments. It is designed to assess standards expected to be attained by all students.[28] Sight singing is a learning requirement in the state at the 8th grade level. Other states are evaluating possible performance assessments as well.Some schools and organizations promote integration of arts classes, such as music, with other subjects, such as math, science, or English. It is thought that by integrating the different curricula will help each subject to build off of one another, enhancing the overall quality of education. Music education can play a vital role in the development of the whole child and their scholastic journey.One example is the Kennedy Center's "Changing Education Through the Arts" program. CETA defines arts integration as finding a natural connection(s) between one or more art forms (dance, drama/theater, music, visual arts, storytelling, puppetry, and/or creative writing) and one or more other curricular areas (science, social studies, English language arts, mathematics, and others) in order to teach and assess objectives in both the art form and the other subject area. This allows a simultaneous focus on creating, performing, and/or responding to the arts while still addressing content in other subject areas.[29]The Learning Maestros is a company whose goal is to create new interdisciplinary musical works and educational materials that explore connections between music and science, literature, visual arts, natural history, and issues of social conscience. It was founded by Julian Fifer and composer Bruce Adolphe. Notable interdisciplinary educational works they have created in collaboration with writers and scientists include "Tyrannosaurus Sue: A Cretaceous Concerto" (for the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago), "Red Dogs and Pink Skies: A Musical Celebration of Paul Gauguin" (in conjunction with an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), "Self Comes to Mind" (created with neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, premiered by Yo-Yo Ma at the American Museum of Natural History, New York), "Let Freedom Sing: the story of Marian Anderson" (with writer Carolivia Herron, premiered by the Washington National Opera), "Zephyronia" (with writer Louise Gikow, for the Imani Winds), and "Witches, Wizards, Spells, and Elves: The Magic of Shakespeare" (for the Chicago Chamber Musicians and the Chicago Shakespeare Theater).The European Union Lifelong Learning Programme 20072013 has funded three projects that use music to support language learning. Lullabies of Europe (for pre-school and early learners),[30] FolkDC (for primary),[31] and the recent PopuLLar (for secondary)[32]According to the Florida Music Educators Association, Music and the Fine Arts have been a significant portion of every cultures educational system for more than 3,000 years. The human brain has been shown to be hard-wired for music; there is a biological basis for music being an important part of human experience. Music and the Arts surround daily life in our present day culture. Most present day artists, architects, and musicians acquired their interests during public school Fine Arts classes... Education without the Fine Arts is fundamentally impoverished and subsequently leads to an impoverished society. [33]William Earhart, former president of the Music Educators National Conference, Music enhances knowledge in the areas of mathematics, science, geography, history, foreign language, physical education, and vocational training."[34] Music not only inspires creativity and performance, but academic performance over all is seriously impacted. A research study produced by the Harris Poll has shown that 9 out of 10 individuals with post graduate degrees participated in music education. The National Report of SAT test takers study indicated students with music performance experience scored higher on the SAT: 57 points higher on verbal and 41 points higher on math.[35] Schools that have high academic performance in the US are spending 20 to 30% of their budget in the arts with emphasis on music education.[36]Music education also increases one's success in society. In every human culture music is carried through for its ideas and ideals. The value of music shapes individual abilities and character starts to developThe Texas Commission on Drugs and Alcohol Abuse Report noted that students who participated in band or orchestra reported the lowest lifetime and current use of all substances included alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.included alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs.[37]An education in music also increases overall brain activity. Research done at the University of Wisconsin has indicated that students with piano or keyboard experience performed 34% higher on tests that measure spatial-temporal lobe activity, which is the part of the brain that is used when doing mathematics, science, and engineering.[38]Music also improves learning. Specifically, music aids in text recall. Wallace (1994) studied setting text to a melody. One experiment created a three verse song with a non-repetitive melody; each verse had different music. A second experiment created a three verse song with a repetitive melody; each verse had exactly the same music. Another experiment studied text recall without music. The repetitive music produced the highest amount of text recall; therefore, music serves as a mnemonic device.[39] Smith (1985) studied background music with word lists. One experiment involved memorizing a word list with background music; participants recalled the words 48 hours later. Another experiment involved memorizing a word list with no background music; participants also recalled the words 48 hours later. Participants who memorized word lists with background music recalled more words demonstrating music provides contextual cues.[40]It is important to note that "While studies show positive influences in other academic areas, music and the Fine Arts are an academic discipline that are, as the other academics, an independent way of learning and knowing." [33] Unfortunately, music in our schools are being cut at a drastic rate due to budget cuts being forced upon the schools. The Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction with Chesapeake Public Schools in Chesapeake, Virginia,[41] Dr. Patricia Powers states, It is not unusual to see program cuts in the area of music and arts when economic issues surface. It is indeed unfortunate to lose support in this area especially since music and the art programs contribute to society in many positive ways. What some school boards do not know is that cutting music might cause test scores to fall due to the positive effect on everything from academics to citizenship and even personal hygiene.[34]Music makes students more successful in school. Skills learned through the discipline of music, transfer to study skills, communication skills, and cognitive skills useful in every part of the school curriculum. It also makes students become successful is participation in ensembles. This helps students learn to work effectively in the school environment and cuts down on resorting to violent or inappropriate behavior.Music also has found to help students with developing intelligence. Studies have found that some measure of a childs intelligence is indeed increased with music instruction. What is new however, is a combination of tightly controlled behavioral studies and groundbreaking neurological research that show how music study can actively contribute to brain development. Researchers at the University of Montreal used various brain imaging techniques to investigate brain activity during musical tasks and found that sight-reading musical scores and playing music both activate regions in all four of the cortexs lobes; and that parts of the cerebellum are also activated during those tasks.Other studies show that music also helps with reasoning. Music makes students better learners and better thinkers.In some communities - and even entire national education systems - music is provided little support as an academic subject area, and music teachers feel that they must actively seek greater public endorsement for music education as a legitimate subject of study. This perceived need to change public opinion has resulted in the development of a variety of approaches commonly called "music advocacy". Music advocacy comes in many forms, some of which are based upon legitimate scholarly arguments and scientific findings, while other examples rely on unconvincing data and remain rather controversial.Among the more recent high-profile music advocacy projects that have become the subject of widespread controversy are the "Mozart Effect" (which is now widely believed to be based on misinterpretation and exaggeration), the National Anthem Project, and the movement referred to as Cultural Diversity in Music Education which seeks out means of equitable pedagogy across students regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic circumstance. Even though the Mozart Effect is a controversy it has some significance in proving that it is reliable. The test has two, a group that has music taught and a group with no music taught. When this test was given to three-year-olds their temporal test improved by 35% over those with no music; this lasted for several days. The only flaw to this test is the different age groups, the older you are the less of the effect it will have on you.[42]Many contemporary music scholars assert that music advocacy will only be truly effective when based on empirically sound arguments that transcend political motivations and personal agendas. This position regarding music advocacy has especially been advanced by music education philosophers (such as Bennett Reimer, Estelle Jorgensen, David J. Elliott, John Paynter and Keith Swanwick,), yet a gap remains between the discourse of music education philosophy and the actual practices of music teachers and music organization executives.1 Overview2 Instructional methodologies

Mumford & Sons are an English rock band. The band consists of Marcus Mumford (vocals, guitar, drums, mandolin), Ben Lovett (vocals, keyboards, accordion, drums), "Country" Winston Marshall (vocals, banjo, dobro, guitar), and Ted Dwane (vocals, string bass, drums, guitar). Mumford & Sons formed in December 2007, emerging out of what some in the media labeled the "West London folk scene" with other artists such as Laura Marling, Johnny Flynn and Noah and the Whale.Mumford & Sons recorded an EP, Love Your Ground, and performed in small to moderate venues in the UK and US to expose audiences to their music and build support for an eventual album. Their debut album, Sigh No More, was released in the UK and Ireland in October 2009, and February 2010 in the United States. The album reached number one in Ireland, Australia and New Zealand and eventually peaked at number two on the UK Album Chart and the Billboard 200 in the US. The band's second studio album Babel was released in September 2012.[1] The album debuted at number one in the UK and US, becoming the fastest selling album of 2012 in the UK, and the biggest selling debut in 2012 in the US.[2][3]The band gained popularity throughout 2010, performing for larger audiences and making their first network television appearances in the US. On 1 December 2010, the band received two Grammy Award nominations, one for Best New Artist and the other for Best Rock Song ("Little Lion Man"). The ensuing live performance at the Grammy ceremony in February led to increased airplay and popularity for singles from Sigh No More. The band won the ARIA Music Award for Most Popular International Artist in 2010, and the Brit Award in 2011 for Best British Album. Furthermore, in 2011 they received a European Border Breakers Award for their international success.Mumford & Sons was formed in December 2007 by multi-instrumentalists Marcus Mumford, Ben Lovett, Winston Marshall, and Ted Dwane.[4] Band members variously play guitar, drums, keyboard instruments, bass guitar, and traditional folk instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and resonator guitar.[5] The band name originates from the fact that Marcus Mumford was the most visible member, organizing the band and their performances. Lovett indicated that the name was meant to invoke the sense of an "antiquated family business name".[6] A handful of similar bands were increasing their visibility in West London around the same time, giving rise to the label "West London folk scene". Mumford downplays that characterisation as an exaggerationMumford & Sons and a few other folk acts just happened to be operating in general area at the time. In an interview with the Herald Sun, Marcus Mumford said, "It's not folk really. Well, some of it is, and it's certainly not a scene. Someone got over-excited about a few bands who live in a hundred-mile radius and put it in a box to sell it as a package. It's a community, not a scene. It's not exclusive."[4] Having developed in the same musical and cultural environment, Mumford & Sons' sound has been compared to that of artists such as Noah and the Whale, The Avett Brothers, Johnny Flynn, and Laura Marling, for whom Marcus Mumford used to drum.[7]In early 2008 the band began working with manager Adam Tudhope, who, as part of management company Everybody's, also represents Keane and Laura Marling.[8] It was through Tudhope's connection that Mumford & Sons were exposed to their future A&R at Island, Louis Bloom, who began monitoring the band. Bloom told HitQuarters that they were still at a fledgling state and not yet ready for a label deal: "There was no one there for it, just a few friends, and they needed time to develop. Over the next six months I kept going to see them and they were literally picking up fans every time."[8]In February 2008, the band completed an extensive UK tour with support from Alessi's Ark, Sons of Noel and Adrian, Peggy Sue, Pete Roe, The Cutaway and others. June marked the band's first appearance at the Glastonbury Festival.[5] Mumford also toured Australia with Laura Marling, whose disinclination to interact with audiences encouraged Mumford into the spotlight. The experience helped inform his attitude toward Mumford & Sons audiences, which is to interact frequently and to try to create a comfortable, casual atmosphere.[4]Mumford & Sons' first project was an EP entitled Love Your Ground which took a year to complete and was released in November 2008 on Chess Club Records.[5]Throughout 2008 and into 2009, Mumford & Sons performed in small to moderate venues in the UK and US, exposing audiences to Love Your Ground tracks and other material that would eventually become Sigh No More. The band finally recorded Sigh No More with Markus Dravs, who had produced albums with artists such as Arcade Fire.[4] At the time, band members did not even own their own instrumentsDravs initially turned them away when they showed up at the recording sessions empty-handed.[9] The only track from Love Your Ground to be included on Sigh No More was "Little Lion Man". The band told the Herald Sun that they self-financed the album to avoid the artistic and technical compromises that sometimes befall studio-financed projects.[4] They toured again in support of Laura Marling in 2009, and Mumford & Sons were contributing musicians to her 2010 album I Speak Because I Can.[4][10]In August 2009, Mumford & Sons signed a licensing deal to Island Records in the UK, to Dew Process in Australia and New Zealand, to Glassnote Records in North America and Cooperative Music in the rest of the world, and through its own label Gentlemen of the Road. Dew Process boss Paul Piticco signed the band after having seen it at a US gig in 2009 and having appreciated its "honest" approach and unique sound.[4] Their debut album was released on 5 October 2009 with "Little Lion Man" as the lead single.Dave Berry of XFM named "Little Lion Man" his record of the week, and in another interview with the band, Berry said "Screw 'of the week', it's my favourite track of the year." BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe made "Little Lion Man" his "Reaction Record" on 27 July 2009,[11] before naming it the "Hottest Record in the World" the following evening.[12]In their first performance on US network television, the band played their single "Little Lion Man" on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman on 17 February 2010. This appearance was followed by a performance of "The Cave" on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on 26 February 2010.[13]Mumford & Sons have been commercially successful in Australia and New Zealand. The single "Little Lion Man" has been popularby January 2010, it had topped the Triple J Hottest 100 list for all of 2009. Its margin of victory was the largest in the history of the chart.[14] In November 2010, the band won an ARIA Music Award for Most Popular International Artist.[15] Sigh No More first reached number 9 on the New Zealand charts in October 2010, and subsequently topped the chart in January 2011 due to strong popularity of singles from the album.[16]In a March 2010 interview, Ray Davies announced that Mumford & Sons will be appearing on his forthcoming collaborations album.[17] Marcus confirmed this in an interview the same month, stating, "I am more excited about that than I have been about anything before in my life".[4] Mumford & Sons performed the track "Days/This Time Tomorrow" along with Davies on 12 February 2010 on Later... with Jools Holland.[18]In December 2010, Mumford & Sons earned Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Song ("Little Lion Man"). While they did not go on to win an award, the band performed their single "The Cave" at the Grammy ceremony. The performance earned positive media attention and boosted visibility for Sigh No MoreUS sales increased by 99% in the period following the ceremony in February 2011.[19][20] The album subsequently peaked at number two on the UK Album Chart and the Billboard 200 in the US.[21][22]On 7 December 2010, in collaboration with Dharohar Project and Laura Marling, Mumford & Sons released an EP album recorded in Delhi, India. The album was recorded in a makeshift studio with traditional Rajasthani musicians and features four collaborations, including multicultural mash-ups of Marling's spirited "Devil's Spoke" and Mumford & Sons' "To Darkness."Sigh No More is certified 2x Platinum in the US[23] and 4x Platinum in the UK.[24]In April 2011 the group joined Old Crow Medicine Show and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros on The Railroad Revival Tour, a tour inspired by the Festival Express tour across Canada in 1970 that included Buddy Guy, Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, and The Band.[25] Traveling exclusively in vintage rail cars, the three bands performed in six "unique outdoor locations" over the course of a week starting in Oakland, California.[26] Ketch Secor of Old Crow told American Songwriter that "Its like we left all our baggage at home and just brought our instruments," often writing new songs while on the train.[27] "We were just on these old rattling rails. It was a railroad odyssey that would have made Woody and Doc tip their hats and blow their whistles,"[28] he says. They appear in the musical documentary Big Easy Express, directed by Emmett Malloy, being made of the trip which premiered March 2012 at the South by Southwest Film Conference and Festival (SXSW Film) in Austin, Texas[29]winning the Headliner Audience Award.[30]Mumford & Sons continued to grow in popularity in 2011, winning several major awards and headlining larger shows and festivals. In February 2011, they received a European Border Breakers Award for their international success.[31] They received a Brit Award for British Album of the Year with Sigh No More and performed "Timshel" at the ceremony.[6] UK sales of the album subsequently increased by 266 percent.[20] While touring the United States in early 2011, the band began writing songs for the follow-up album. Keyboardist Ben Lovett credited the creative atmosphere of Nashville, Tennessee with easing the songwriting process.[32] While performing in Kansas City, Missouri on 3 June, the first stop of their US Tour, the band announced they have been recording a new album, initially set to be released in late 2011. They then performed several new tracks from the forthcoming album, the title of which was not revealed.[33]Mumford & Sons played at the Glastonbury festival on Friday 24June 2011, and then embarked on a North American tour.[34] Mumford & Sons have recorded two songs for Andrea Arnold's adaptation of Wuthering Heights, one of which (entitled "Enemy") will be played over the closing credits.[35]Through 2011, the band continued to 'road test' songs from their upcoming album, many of which had been written before and during the writing of Sigh No More.In June 2012, Mumford & Sons contributed a song "Learn Me Right" with Birdy to the Pixar film Brave, which came to be called "Not with Haste". Soundtrack.[36]On 16 July 2012, Mumford & Sons officially announced the details of their second studio album Babel, including the release date of 24 September 2012 and a track listing of 12 songs.[37] A deluxe edition containing three exclusive songs was also announced. A week later, the album became available for pre-order.[38]The lead single "I Will Wait" premiered on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on Tuesday 7 August.[39][40] On 29 August 2012, Mumford & Sons recorded their live performance of "I Will Wait" at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado.[41] The performance was released on 9 September as the bands official video for the song.[41]On 22 September 2012, the band performed two songs from the new album, "I Will Wait" and "Below My Feet", on Saturday Night Live.[42] Mumford & Sons' second album Babel debuted at number one on the UK Album Chart and the US Billboard 200.[2][3] It became the fastest selling album of 2012 in the UK, selling over 158,000 copies in its first week, and was the biggest selling debut of any album in 2012 in the US, selling 600,000 in its first week,[2][3] and over a million worldwide.In November 2012, Mumford & Sons released their 2013 East Coast tour, which includes stops in Boston, New York and Fairfax, Va. in February 2013.[43]Mumford & Sons use bluegrass and folk instrumentation, such as a banjo, upright bass, mandolin and piano, played with a rhythmic style based in alternative rock and folk.Much of Mumford & Sons' lyrical content has a strong literary influence, its debut album name deriving from Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing. The track "Sigh No More" includes lines from the play such as Serve God love me and mend and One foot in sea and one on shore. The song "Roll Away Your Stone" is influenced by Macbeth; the song includes the line Stars hide your fires / And these here are my desires which echoes Macbeth's line in Act 1 Scene 4: Stars, hide your fires, / Let not light see my black and deep desires. [44] In an interview, Mumford was quoted as saying, "You can rip off Shakespeare all you like; no lawyer's going to call you up on that one."[45][46] Additionally, "The Cave" includes several references to The Odyssey, also referencing Plato's "Allegory of the Cave", from The Republic. More specifically, the song references G.K. Chesterton's book St. Francis of Assisi, in which Chesterton uses Plato's Cave as a way of explaining how St. Francis views the world from God's perspective."Heres the elevator pitch on Mumford & Sons: U2 meets Old Crow Medicine Show at Bruce Springsteens house. They have Old Crows rootsy instrumentation and vintage wardrobe, and they share the Boss heart-on-the-sleeve sincerity and world-conquering ambition. From U2 the band takes a melodramatic sense of musical dynamics, and singer-lyricist Marcus Mumford models Bonos strategy for rendering spiritual longing in terms that are accessible to a post-Christian world."[47]Both "Timshel" and "Dust Bowl Dance" draw heavily from the John Steinbeck novels Of Mice and Men, East of Eden and The Grapes of Wrath. Mumford, in an interview, even compared touring to a Steinbeck adventure: "[Steinbeck] talked about how a journey is a thing of its own, and you can't plan it or predict it too much because that suffocates the life out it. That's kind of what touring is like. Even though there's a structureyou know what towns you're going to, and that you'll be playing a gigpretty much anything can happen." Mumford also in his spare time runs an online book club on the band's official web site.[48]Mumford recognizes the Old Crow Medicine Show influence: "I first heard Old Crows music when I was, like, 16, 17, and that really got me into, like, folk music, bluegrass. I mean, Id listened to a lot of Dylan, but I hadnt really ventured into the country world so much. So Old Crow were the band that made me fall in love with country music."[49] Mumford acknowledges in "Big Easy Express", Emmett Malloy's "moving documentary" about the vintage train tour they'd invited Old Crow to join them on, that "the band inspired them to pick up the banjo and start their now famous country nights in London." Ketch Secor, Old Crow front-man, concurs: "Those boys took the message and ran with it."[50]Emmylou Harris was . .1 History

Matthew Paul Miller (born June 30, 1979), known by his Hebrew name and stage name Matisyahu ("Gift of God"), is an American reggae and alternative rock musician.Known for blending traditional Jewish themes with reggae, rock and hip hop beatboxing sounds, Matisyahu's 2005 single "King Without a Crown" was a Top 40 hit in the United States.[1] Since 2004, he has released four studio albums as well as two live albums, two remix CDs and two DVDs featuring live concerts. In addition, Matisyahu played the role of Tzadok in The Possession, a supernatural horror film directed by Ole Bornedal and co-produced by Sam Raimi. Through his career, Matisyahu has worked with Bill Laswell reggae producers Sly & Robbie, and Kool Kojak.Matisyahu was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania. His family eventually settled in White Plains in Westchester County, Ohio.[2] He was brought up a Reconstructionist Jew, and attended Hebrew school at Bet Am Shalom, a synagogue in White Plains. He spent much of his childhood learning the various tenets of Judaism, but by the time he was a teenager, Matisyahu began to rebel against his upbringing.[3] He started taking drugs and dropped out of White Plains High School. He became a self-professed "Phish-head," taking hallucinogens and following the rock band Phish on tour.[4] He finished high school at a wilderness program in Bend, Oregon.[5]In the fall of 1995[citation needed], Matisyahu took part in a two month-long program at the Alexander Muss High School in Hod Hasharon, Israel, a program which offers students first-hand exploration of Jewish heritage as a way of solidifying Jewish identity.His experiences there led to his decision to adopt Orthodox Judaism. Initially he found his way to the Carlebach Shul on the West Side of Manhattan. Matisyahu then sought out Chabad of Washington Square, a branch of the large Hasidic movement also often called Lubavitch. Matisyahu began playing with the Jewish band Pey Dalid.[6] At the age of 19, Miller formally joined the Lubavitch movement and took a Hebrew form of his name: Matisyahu.Matisyahu is an Ashkenazic Hebrew pronunciation of a Biblical Hebrew name ( - Mattityahu; Greek: Mattathias), the name of the 2nd century BC Jewish leader of the Maccabees' revolt. The English equivalent is Matthew.In an interview in Kosher Spirit Magazine (a publication by OK Kosher Certification), Matisyahu explained the origin of his use of the name as follows: while he, like most Jewish boys, received a Hebrew name at his brit milah (circumcision ceremony), when he was eight days old, Miller's family lost track of the names given. In Hebrew school, it was assumed to be Matisyahu because of the connection between Matthew and Matisyahu. The original certificate from the brit was later located and Miller discovered that the actual name given at the brit was the Yiddish name "Feivish Hershel". He was advised by his rabbis to continue using the Hebrew name that he had grown up with.[7]From 2001 through July 2007, Matisyahu was affiliated with the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic community in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, New York. However, as of July 17, 2007, he told the Miami New Times in an interview that he no longer "necessarily" identifies with the Lubavitch movement. In the interview, he stated that "...the more I'm learning about other types of Jews, I don't want to exclude myself. I felt boxed in."[8] Additionally, in the fall of 2007, while on a family vacation spent primarily in Jerusalem's Nachlaot neighborhood, he expressed interest in another Hasidic sect, that of Karlin.[9] As of November 2007 he has confirmed a preference to pray at the Karliner synagogue in Boro Park where the custom is to ecstatically scream prayers; however he continues to reside in Crown Heights because of his wife's affinity for the community.[10]Soon after his adoption of hasidism, Matisyahu began studying Torah at Hadar Hatorah, a yeshiva for returnees to Judaism where he wrote and recorded his first album. He counts Bob Marley, Phish,[11] God Street Wine and Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach among his musical inspirations and gives credit to Rabbi Simon Jacobson's book Toward a Meaningful Life for the lyrical inspiration to Youth's title track. As part of his faith, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sundown on Friday; thus he does not perform in concert on Friday nights. An exception to this rule occurred at a 2007 concert in Fairbanks, Alaska; since the sun did not set until 2:00a.m., performing in the late hours was not a violation of Jewish observance.[12]Matisyahu met NYU film student Talia when she interviewed him for a documentary about men and women not touching. Rabbi Korn set them up,[13] and they married in August 2004.[14] Together they have sons Laivy (2005), Shalom,[15] and Menachem Mendel (2011).[16]On December 13, 2011, Matisyahu posted a beardless picture of himself on Twitter, explaining on his website:[17]In June 2012, Matisyahu appeared in an online video to promote his new single "Sunshine" with his hair dyed blonde and appeared to be without a yarmulka (skull cap),[18] causing a big stir within the Jewish blogosphere.[19][20]Miller performed for over a year as MC Truth in the Bend, Oregon band Soulfori.In 2004, Matisyahu, after having signed with JDub Records, a nonprofit record label that promotes Jewish musicians, released his first album, Shake Off the Dust...Arise. At Bonnaroo 2005, Trey Anastasio of the band Phish invited him for a guest spot on his set.[21]His major label debut album was produced by Bill Laswell, with minor contribution by pop producers Jimmy Douglass and the Ill Factor.His live album, Live at Stubb's, released in 2006, was recorded at a concert in Austin, Texas was followed by the studio album Youth.In 2005 and 2006 he toured extensively in the United States, Canada and Europe; and made a number of stops in Israel, including a performance as the supporting act for Sting in June 2006. In late 2006, he released No Place to Be, a remix album featuring re-recordings and remixes of songs from all three of his earlier albums, as well as a cover of "Message in a Bottle" by The Police.The live version of the song King Without a Crown, broke into the Modern Rock Top 10 in 2006. The accompanying video and album, Youth, produced by Bill Laswell, was released on March 7, 2006. On March 16, Youth was Billboard magazine's number-one Digital Album. In 2006, he appeared once again at Bonnaroo, this time performing a solo set.[22]In spring 2006, right before the release of Youth, he cut ties with his managers at JDub Records. JDub managed his act, but was not his record label.[23]At the 2007 Slamdance Film Festival, the film Unsettled, in which Matisyahu appears, won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary Feature. While attending the festival, he performed in an impromptu concert at the Park City Film Music Festival in Park City, Utah. In the summer of 2007 he joined 311 on their Summer Unity Tour. He also performed in the 2008 documentary Call + Response.[24]His third studio album, Light, was released on August 25, 2009, along with the live EP Live at Twist & Shout.From July 10 to July 30, 2010, Matisyahu (along with The Dirty Heads) supported Sublime with Rome (the new version of the band) on their US tour.[25]In November 2009, NBC used Matisyahu's song "One Day" as background music for their advertisement of the Olympic games. This stirred up speculation that "One Day" may become the theme song for the 2010 Olympics. However, it remained only NBC's top pick, and was not announced to be the theme song.[26]On August 2, 2010, Matisyahu revealed to OC Weekly that he has been writing new songs for his next album, which was expected to be recorded within weeks of his statement.[27]On November 26, 2010, Matisyahu released a special edition Record Store Day Black Friday 7" vinyl called, Two for independent record stores.Matisyahu recorded the Sephardic music-influenced hip hop song "Two Child One Drop" for the Sephardic Music Festival, Vol. 1 compilation album released by Shemspeed, alongside artists such as Hasidic rapper Y-Love, Israeli hip-hop group Hadag Nahash, and psychedelic rock/Sephardic fusion group Pharaoh's Daughter.[28]On August 18, 2010, Matisyahu returned to Stubb's in Austin, Texas for another live recording for Live at Stubb's, Vol. 2. The album was released on February 1, 2011.[29]In 2011 he embarked on a concert tour.In March 2011, Matisyahu took part in clip "Pure Soul". The song is of DeScribe, Hasidic Jewish singer.On May 8, 2012, Matisyahu released a new single featuring a new version of his song "Sunshine" as one of his singles of his new album Spark Seeker, which was released on July 17, 2012 in the United States.Matisyahu fuses the contemporary styles of rap, beatboxing, and hip-hop in general, with the more traditional vocal disciplines of jazz's scat singing and Judaism's hazzan style of songful prayermore often than not rolling it all into a dominant background of reggae music.[original research?] The New York Times' Kelefa Sanneh wrote that "His sound owes a lot to early dancehall reggae stars like Barrington Levy and Eek-a-Mouse."[30] The Chicago Tribune's Kevin Pang described a Matisyahu performance as "soul-shaking brand of dancehall reggae, a show that captures both the jam band vibe of Phish and the ska-punk of Sublime."[citation needed] Coming from his Jewish beliefs and compounding his use of the hazzan style, Matisyahu's lyrics are mostly English with more than occasional use of Hebrew and Yiddish.In 2006, Matisyahu stated that "All of my songs are influenced and inspired by the teachings that inspire me. I want my music to have meaning, to be able to touch people and make them think. Chasidism teaches that music is 'the quill of the soul.' Music taps into a very deep place and speaks to us in a way that regular words can't."[31]In 2009, he said about his recently released album Light, "I think the vast majority of people that respect what I do are willing to move with me. I think it's not so much about genres or styles of music as it is about expressing the emotion or the idea. ... Whatever allows you to do that, whatever style, as long as it's authentic." In 2010 he also confirmed his first speaking date at the University of Central Florida.[32]Matisyahu has performed with Kenny Muhammad, a Muslim beatboxer. He also recorded the song "One Day" along with Akon.[33]Matisyahu is featured on Trevor Hall's single "Unity" from his self-titled album. Matisyahu is also featured on "Roots in Stereo" and "Strength of My Life" from P.O.D.'s album Testify.Matisyahu collaborated with Infected Mushroom on the song "One Day", as well as during various live sets.Matisyahu collaborated with Moon Taxi on the song "Square Circles" off the band's 2012 release "Cabaret".He has also collaborated with The Crystal Method in their single "Drown in the Now."He is featured on The Dirty Heads's album Cabin by the Sea on the single "Dance All Night".Since his debut, Matisyahu has received positive reviews from both rock and reggae outlets. In 2006 he was named as Top Reggae Artist by Billboard[34] as well as being named a spokesperson for Kenneth Cole.[35] In 2006 Esquire's Esky Music Awards - Most Lovable Oddball in The magazine called him "the most intriguing reggae artist in the world."[36][37][37][37][37][47][37]1 Biography

The Black Eyed Peas is a North American hip hop group. It mainly comprises rappers will.i.am, apl.de.ap, and Taboo, and singer Fergie. Originally an alternative hip hop group, they have since added R&B, pop, dance, electro and techno influences. Though founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album Elephunk in 2003 that they found widespread acclaim and achieved high record sales. Since that time, the group has sold an estimated 56 million records worldwide.[1] According to Nielsen SoundScan, the Black Eyed Peas are the second-best-selling artist or group for downloaded tracks, with over 42 million sales as of the end of 2011.[2]Their first major hit was the 2003 single "Where Is the Love?" from Elephunk, which topped 13 international charts. Another European hit single from the album was "Shut Up". Their fourth album Monkey Business, was an even bigger worldwide success, certified 4 Platinum in the U.S., and spawning two singles, "My Humps" and "Don't Phunk with My Heart". In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Billboard Hot 100, with their singles "Boom Boom Pow" and "I Gotta Feeling"; which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks. The album later produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with "Imma Be", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album before being followed with "Rock That Body" and "Meet Me Halfway" which managed to peak in the Top 10 of Hot 100. "I Gotta Feeling" became the first single to sell more than 1 million downloads in the United Kingdom.[3] The Black Eyed Peas were ranked 12th on the Billboard's Decade-End Chart Artist of the Decade, and 7th in the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade. On the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, which held in January, 2010 they won 3 awards out of 6 nominations.In November 2010, they released the album The Beginning. In February 2011, the group performed at the Super Bowl XLV halftime show. The album's first two singles "The Time (Dirty Bit)" and "Just Can't Get Enough" became international hits and topped the charts in many countries.During an interview with NRJ, will.i.am talking about his solo album also confirmed that The Black Eyed Peas will start recording sessions for their seventh studio album in 2013.[4]The Black Eyed Peas date back to 1988, when eighth-graders William Adams (will.i.am) and Allan Pineda (apl.de.ap) met and began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) in 1992, catching the attention of Eazy-E manager Jerry Heller's nephew. Along with another friend of theirs, Dante Santiago, they called their trio Atban Klann (ATBAN: A Tribe Beyond a Nation).[5] Will 1X (aka will.i.am), apl.de.ap, Mookie Mook, DJ Motiv8 (aka Monroe Walker), and Dante Santiago formed Atban Klann. Their debut album, Grass Roots, was never released due to Ruthless records founder Eazy-E's death.[5] Internet in Serena After Eazy-E died in 1995, Atban Klann reformed and changed their name to Black Eyed Pods, and then Black Eyed Peas. Dante Santiago was replaced with Jaime Gomez (Taboo), and Kim Hill became a steady background singer. Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the "Gangsta Rap" sounds of Los Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. After being signed to Interscope Records and releasing their debut, Behind the Front (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was "Joints & Jam", and was featured on the Bulworth soundtrack. Their second album was Bridging the Gap (2000), which had the single "Request + Line" featuring R&B singer Macy Gray.Their third album Elephunk began development on November 2, 2001, but was not released until 2003. It was the first album to feature the vocals of current member Fergie. Nicole Scherzinger was originally approached to join the Peas, but was forced to decline because she was a member of Eden's Crush and was under contract. Dante Santiago then introduced will.i.am to Fergie, who joined the band in 2002. Elephunk is also the first album that indicated and demonstrated the new, polished pop sound designed to attract mass audiences. In a positive review of The Black Eyed Peas' new-found style, Rolling Stone noted that since 2002, when the group "hired a blond bombshell named Stacy 'Fergie' Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred, they have made a kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs  a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their United Colors of Benetton worldview."[6]From Elephunk came "Where Is the Love?", which became The Black Eyed Peas' first major hit, peaking at No.8 on the U.S. Hot 100, but topping the charts in several other countries, including seven weeks at No.1 in the United Kingdom, where it became the biggest-selling single of 2003. The single had similar results in Australia, staying at No.1 for six weeks. In an interview with TalkofFame.com, Taboo shared that Justin Timberlake's split with Britney Spears impacted the recording of "Where Is The Love?".[7]The album subsequently spawned "Shut Up", which peaked at No.2 in the UK and topped the charts in many success and went Gold and Platinum in the U.S., UK, Germany, and other European markets.The third single from the album, although significantly restyled from the original Elephunk version, "Hey Mama" hit the top 5 in Australia and the top 10 in the UK, Germany and other European countries and reached No.23 in the U.S. The song received even more exposure in 2003 when it was featured in the first "silhouette" television commercial for the iPod.Their fourth single from the album was titled "Let's Get It Started", which was re-titled from its original name of "Let's Get Retarded" to ensure radio play with no backlash for being considered as offensive to the mentally disabled. "Let's Get It Started" won a 2005 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group and also received two nominations for Record of the Year and Best Rap Song.In 2004, The Black Eyed Peas embarked on the Elephunk Tour, hitting many countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia.Their fourth album, Monkey Business, was recorded through 2004 and was released on June 7, 2005. Much of the pre-production writing was performed on the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus while on The Black Eyed Peas tour of 2004. The album's first single, "Don't Phunk with My Heart", was a hit in the U.S., reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100. The spot the song reached was the highest peak yet of their career in the U.S. (this was later broken when "Boom Boom Pow" peaked at the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100) and earned them another Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The song reached three in the UK, and five in Canada, and stayed at number one for three weeks in Australia. Some radio stations, concerned about complaints of obscenity, played an alternative version, "Don't Mess with My Heart". "Don't Lie", the second single from the album, saw success on the U.S. Hot 100, reaching No. 14, although becoming somewhat more successful in the UK and Australia, reaching a peak of No.6 in both countries. "My Humps", another song from the album, immediately achieved commercial success in the U.S. and fairly substantial radio play despite the sexually suggestive lyrics, reaching number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number one in Australia, making it their fourth Australian number one single. However, many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content; John Bush, writing for Allmusic, described it as "one of the most embarrassing rap performances of the new millennium".[8] Despite this, the album Monkey Business debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart, selling over 295,000 copies in its first week and was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA. Their next and last commercially-released single from the album was "Pump It", which borrows much of its sound from "Misirlou", specifically Dick Dale's version; it peaked at number 8 in Australia but 18 in America.In September 2005, The Black Eyed Peas released an iTunes Originals playlist of their greatest hits, as well as some that were re-recorded especially for purchase through iTunes.

("The Energy Never Dies"), was released on June 9, 2009. The overall sound of the album has a more electro hop beat rather than the usual hip pop/R&B feeling of their previous albums. Following its release, will.i.am remarked that the album had been inspired by a trip to Australia, specifically the sound of The Presets' "My People". "The energy on the Presets' small little stage was crazy energy. That song My People  that shit is wild," will.i.am said, "That's the reason why this record sounds the way it does  my three months in Australia."[11] In its first week, the album sold 304,000 copies and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200.

Ryan Benjamin Tedder (born June 26, 1979) is an American singer-songwriter, Grammy Award winning record producer and multi-instrumentalist.[1][2] He is best known as the frontman of the pop rock band OneRepublic, though he has an independent career as songwriter and producer for various artists such as Adele, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonc, B.o.B, Kelly Clarkson, Far East Movement, Adam Lambert, Jordin Sparks, Leona Lewis, Gavin DeGraw, David Cook, Demi Lovato, Sebastian Ingrosso, Maroon 5, Gym Class Heroes, T-Pain, Zedd, and Paul Oakenfold.[3]Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Tedder was raised by an extended family of missionaries and pastors and grew up in the church.[4][5] He began learning to play the piano at the age of three via the Suzuki method.[4] His early interest in music was prompted by his musician father and school-teacher mother, who coaxed their young son into practicing piano in exchange for candy corn.[4] Tedder started singing at the age of seven.[2] A self-taught vocalist, Tedder began honing this skill at the age of twelve by imitating his favorite artists, who ranged from The Beatles to acts as diverse as Peter Gabriel, Stevie Wonder and Sting. He has commented, "I sang for two hours a day every day of my life until I was eighteen."[4] He continued to perform musically during his adolescence through church, school, and personally formed groups.[2]In his senior year, he moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado.[6] There he met and became friends with future OneRepublic band-mate Zach Filkins on their soccer team at the Colorado Springs Christian School. He attended Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma and began to showcase his own material there. Tedder completed his college education and graduated from ORU in 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Relations and Advertising.[7]For years Tedder worked as a waiter, and also as a shop assistant at Pottery Barn, before securing an internship at DreamWorks SKG in Nashville, singing on demos to break into the music scene. He produced demos for songwriters and labels, charging $300 to $400 a track.[4] Tedder claims that DreamWorks offered him his first publishing deal shortly after his arrival; however, he was intent on pursuing a career as an artist and his first venture in that arena came via a different route all together.At the age of twenty-one, Tedder competed in a singer-songwriter competition and was selected by 'N Sync singer Lance Bass as one of five finalists to perform on a one-hour special on MTV, performing original material in front of millions of viewers.[8] The prize for the winner was a music contract with Bass's now-defunct management company, Free Lance Entertainment.[8] The contestants performed live and were then rated by judges and the audience; the highest scoring artist winning the contract. Tedder's performance of one of his songs, "The Look", received the most votes from the judges and fans, and he won the competition; however, a contract with a recording label was not finalized and no album was released.[8] Tedder later revealed the record and publishing deal he was offered "wasn't real. It was just a bunch of hype that didn't turn into anything."[9]One year after winning the MTV competition, Tedder caught the attention of the hip hop producer Timbaland.[10] Tedder commented that he was with Timbaland from 2002-2004 to develop as an artist while producing for other artists at the time.[9] Tedder's work crossed many musical genres (ranging from hip hop, R&B, rock, pop to dance/techno) and he has had many chart successes both in America and the United Kingdom with a number of artists. In June 2007, Tedder signed a worldwide publishing administration deal with Kobalt Music Publishing. The deal included Tedder's new works and all songs not performed by OneRepublic.Tedder is the writer of the worldwide smash hit, "Apologize", performed by his band OneRepublic, which as of 2008 is the best-selling and charting single of the decade.[11] The song broke the US Top 40 Radio Airplay Record with 10,331 spins in one week. It was the number-one most played song for five months until May 7, 2008 when Leona Lewis's "Bleeding Love" (a song that Tedder co-wrote and produced), broke the record previously set by "Apologize", with 10,665 spins in one week.[12] "Bleeding Love" was the best-selling single of 2007 in the United Kingdom, topping the UK charts for seven weeks and was the fastest selling CD of 2007 receiving the most radio airplay worldwide prior to its US debut. The song also earned a Best British Single award nomination at the Brit Awards in February 2008 and reached number one in over 35 countries. Tedder and co-writer Jesse McCartney received an ASCAP award for writing the song. Tedder is also credited for writing the treatment for the second music video that was filmed for the US release of "Bleeding Love". It also earned a Record Of The Year nomination at the February 2009 Grammy awards.[13]Tedder has written and produced singles with artists such as Jennifer Lopez, Adele, Carrie Underwood, Leona Lewis, Jennifer Hudson, Alexandra Burke, Backstreet Boys, Beyonc, Monrose, David Cook, Big Time Rush, Jordin Sparks, AJ McLean, Chris Cornell, Ashley Tisdale, Ludacris, Gavin DeGraw, James Blunt, James Morrison, Paula DeAnda, Hilary Duff, Timbaland, Bubba Sparxxx, Dima Bilan, Shayne Ward, Lemar, Esmee Denters, Clay Aiken, t.A.T.u., Menudo, Ashanti, Natasha Bedingfield, Whitney Houston, Westlife, Charice, Varsity Fanclub, Sugababes, Daughtry, Mario, DJ Tiesto and a number of songs with various rock acts in the US and abroad.[14] He worked with Jennifer Lopez on her 2007 single Do It Well from her album Brave, then worked with Kelly Clarkson on her 2009 album All I Ever Wanted, penning the songs "If I Can't Have You", "Impossible", "Save You", "Tip Of My Tongue" and "Already Gone", which features vocals from Ryan. He also worked with Beyonc on her album I Am Sasha Fierce, penning the song "Halo." The similarity between the songs "Already Gone" and "Halo" prompted Clarkson to publicly state that she did not know about "Halo" and that both songs were co-written by Tedder.[15] Tedder's work with Beyonc also earned him two Grammy nominations with Record Of The Year for "Halo" and Album Of The Year for I Am...Sasha Fierce at the January 2010 Grammy Awards. Tedder worked extensively on Leona Lewis's second album Echo, writing and producing many songs with her, three of which have made the album, including the first single "Happy", "You Don't Care" which features vocals from Ryan and "Lost Then Found", which features OneRepublic. Tedder co-wrote and produced Jordin Sparks' lead single "Battlefield" from her second album of the same name. Tedder worked on American Idol Season 8 runner up, Adam Lambert's debut album For Your Entertainment.In late 2009, Tedder launched his own record company, Patriot Records. Recently signed buzz artist My Name Is Kay, will release her debut EP through Interscope in 2012. Nikki Flores' single "City Lights" was released in the fall of 2010 on Universal/Republic Records. Tedder also formed his own publishing company, Patriot Games Publishing, in 2009 in alliance with Kobalt Music Publishing Worldwide. To date he has a stable of top notch writers and producers such as Inflo, Noel Zancanella, and Brent Kutzle, cellist/bassist of OneRepublic. The Patriot team of writers and producers with Tedder are credited with "I Was Here" by Beyonc, "Good Life" by OneRepublic, "I Just Had Sex" by The Lonely Island featuring Akon, "Lost Then Found" by Leona Lewis and OneRepublic, "Just a Guy" by BC Jean, "Count on You" by Big Time Rush featuring Jordin Sparks, and "And Then We Dance," the #1 hit single from Australia's Got Talent winners Justice Crew.More recently, Ryan is credited with writing and producing hits from some of 2011's most anticipated albums, including Adele's "21," Beyonc's "4," Colbie Caillat's "All Of You," Gavin Degraw's "Sweeter," among others.Tedder worked on Demi Lovato's third album Unbroken, released on September 20, 2011. About working with her, Tedder commented, "Demi blew me out of the water vocally! I had no idea how good her voice is. She's one of the best singers I've ever worked with. Literally, that good... I mean, she's a Kelly Clarkson-level vocalist. And Kelly has a set of pipes". In 2011, he composed a new song for Vanness Wu, "Is this All" in Taiwan. He co-wrote David Cook's "The Last Goodbye" from his second album.[16] He produced a song for K'naan titled "Better".[17] He co-wrote "Good in Goodbye" for Carrie Underwood's third album Blown Away, released on May 1, 2012. He produced tracks for Maroon 5's new album Overexposed. He has also been working on tracks for Jennifer Lopez's new untitled 2012 album, one of the songs being "Clothes Off".[18] Tedder co-wrote and co-produced the song "Sattelite" for British band The Wanted which appears on their US album released on April 24, 2012.[19] He also worked on B.o.B's Strange Clouds, released in May 2012; he produced and co-wrote single "So Good" and is featured on "Never Let You Go".Tedder was featured in Far East Movement's 2010 hit single "Rocketeer," as well as the current Gym Class Heroes single,"The Fighter". He has also recorded vocal tracks for Sebastian Ingrosso and Alesso's dance music track he also co-wrote, titled "Calling."[20]Tedder is currently working with Ellie Goulding, Trey Songz, Jason Derulo, Cody Simpson, Lady Antebellum, Marina and the Diamonds, Dan Black, and Lights on their forthcoming studio albums.[citation needed]Tedder was also a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.[21]As well as producing, Tedder also sings lead vocals and plays guitar and piano for the band, OneRepublic. The five member band consisting of Tedder, Filkins, Eddie Fisher, Drew Brown, and Brent Kutzle was formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 2002 by Tedder and his high school classmate Zach Filkins.[22] Tedder has since revealed that the band was formed at a "crossroads" in his life: "I was offered two publishing deals within two months of being in NashvilleI could have just written songs and lived a carefree life, but I knew that I had to be an artist. I wanted to form a rock band and create my own sound."[4] Based in Los Angeles, OneRepublic started out as an unsigned act on the social networking website, MySpace. Since June 2004, they have accumulated over fifty million plays for their music on the site. As of 2009, they are the number-one band on MySpace and have been in the MySpace Music's Top Artists since the summer of 2006.[23]The band gained further exposure when their 2007 single, "Apologize", was re-mixed and re-released on Timbaland's compilation album, Timbaland Presents Shock Value. The remix became an international chart hit in the fall of 2007. The song broke records after gaining 10,331 spins in one week. According to SoundScan, "Apologize" is the most legally downloaded song in US digital history with sales of over 4.3 million digital downloads in the US alone.[24] It is also the second best-selling song of the decade.[25] OneRepublic's debut album, Dreaming Out Loud, includes both the song's original version and version with Timbaland, and was released on November 20, 2007 on Timbaland's Mosley Music Group imprint via Interscope Records.[26] The band had previously been signed to Columbia Records, and their album was due to be released in 2006, but this did not occur. Tedder explained, "Crap happened. People got fired. Labels merged and politics abounded".[27] Subsequently, the band was released from their deal with Columbia, and they were signed by Timbaland in the summer of 2006 becoming the first rock band to be signed to Mosley Music Group.[27] Tedder has commented on the success of his band's hit single, "Apologize": "The toughest thing to do is write a hit song, but we had a hit song before we had an album What has happened has been really strange and really great."[26]Tedder is a multi-instrumentalist. During OneRepublic's performances, he often switches from singing lead vocals to playing guitar, bass guitar, glockenspiel, tambourine, or piano. On rare occasions, he plays drums alongside the band's main percussionist, Eddie Fisher.The band finished recording their second album, titled "Waking Up" on August 25, 2009, and released their lead single, "All the Right Moves" to radio and iTunes everywhere except Germany and Austria, where "Secrets" was released instead. The album was released on November 17, 2009 in the United States. To date, the second US single, "Secrets" has reached over 2 million digital downloads, and third single "Good Life" broke into the Top 10 on iTunes and radio everywhere.In January 2012, the band was working on their upcoming album.[28] Upon an interview from the 2012 Grammys, Ryan announced that they were halfway through working on it. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of Feel Again, a single from the album, will be donated to Save the Children's Every Beat Matters campaign to support training frontline health workers around the world.[29]Ryan Tedder is married. He openly acknowledged and thanked his wife, Genevieve, in the liner notes of OneRepublic's debut album Dreaming Out Loud. Ryan and Genevieve have a son, Copeland Cruz Tedder, born on August 2, 2010 in Denver, Colorado.[30] Tedder's second cousins, Adam, Ashley and Austin Clark comprise the band Sons of Sylvia and were formerly in The Clark Family Experience. He co-wrote their song "Love Left to Lose".[31] Despite being a Christian, he does not want to be labeled as a "Christian artist".[5] He has on one arm a tattoo written in old Japanese which he got while he was in Osaka, meaning "God's will" and literally means "God gives and God takes".[32][33]Tedder became involved with Southern Hospitality, a restaurant co-created in 2007 by Justin Timberlake at Second Avenue in Manhattan,[34] when it opened a second location in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan.[35] On August 22, 2011, it was announced that Tedder had become the first franchisee of the Southern Hospitality BBQ brand and that there were plans to bring the concept in ten cities across the United States including Denver, Nashville, Dallas, Austin, Houston, New Orleans, Atlanta, Phoenix, Palo Alto and Washington, D.C.[36] They will open a restaurant in the St. Elmo Hotel in October 2012.[34]1 Early life and education2 Career

Christopher Anthony John "Chris" Martin (born 2 March 1977) is an English singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, and is the lead vocalist, pianist, rhythm guitarist and founder of the band Coldplay.Chris Martin was born in Whitestone, Exeter, Devon and is the eldest of five children. His father, Anthony Martin, is a retired accountant, and his mother, Alison Martin, is a music teacher.[1][2] Martin started his education at the pre-preparatory Hylton School and then went on to preparatory Exeter Cathedral School.[3] It was at the prep school that Martin formed his first band, The Rocking Honkies, with Nick Repton and Iwan Gronow. Their debut performance was met with boos from the crowd.[4] After Exeter Cathedral, Martin boarded at Sherborne School, a boys' independent school in Dorset. He also met future Coldplay manager Phil Harvey at the school.[5] Martin continued his studies at University College London, staying at Ramsay Hall where he read Ancient World Studies and graduated with First Class honours in Greek and Latin.[2][6] It is here he met future Coldplay bandmates Jonny Buckland, Will Champion and Guy Berryman.[7]While studying at University College London, Martin met Jonny Buckland, Will Champion and Guy Berryman. In January 1998, they formed the rock band Coldplay. The band has had internationally recognised fame and success since their debut album, Parachutes, in 2000. Since then, they have released several further albums/EPs including: A Rush of Blood to the Head, Live 2003, X&Y, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, Prospekt's March, LeftRightLeftRightLeft and Mylo Xyloto.As a solo artist, Martin has written songs for a variety of acts including Embrace ("Gravity") and Jamelia ("See It in a Boy's Eyes", co-written with Coldplay producer Rik Simpson). Martin has also collaborated with Ron Sexsmith, Faultline when he sang on two haunting Faultline tracks: 'Where is My Boy?' and 'Your Love Means Everything Part2.', The Streets, and Ian McCulloch. He also sang a part of the vocals for the Band Aid 20 single, "Do They Know It's Christmas?" at the end of 2004. In 2005, Martin collaborated with Nelly Furtado on the track "All Good Things (Come to an End)", for her 2006 album, Loose. The two were once rumoured to be a couple, after they both performed at Glastonbury in 2002. Furtado joked about the situation, saying that "Yeah, he's my boyfriend  he just doesn't know it yet".[8]Martin's fascination with hip hop was shown in mid-2006 when he collaborated with rapper Jay-Z for the rapper's comeback album Kingdom Come after the two met earlier in the year. Martin put some chords together for a song known as "Beach Chair" and sent them to Jay-Z who enlisted the help of hip hop producer Dr. Dre to mix it (contrary to popular opinion it was Coldplay producer Rik Simpson and not Dre who conceived and performed the drum beats). The song was performed on 27 September 2006 by the two during Jay-Z's European tour at Royal Albert Hall. In 2007, Martin appeared on a track titled "Part of the Plan" for Swizz Beatz' debut solo album One Man Band Man. Martin has also worked on a solo collaboration with Kanye West, with whom he shared an impromptu jam session during a 2006 concert at Abbey Road Studios.[9] He performed the chorus of "Homecoming", from West's album Graduation.Martin's and Coldplay's main influence is the Scottish rock band Travis, with Martin crediting the band for the creation of his own group.[10] U2 has been another important influence on Martin both musically and politically,[11] on whom he wrote for Rolling Stone magazine's "100 Greatest Artists of All Time",[12] in the section on U2, saying: "I don't buy weekend tickets to Ireland and hang out in front of their gates, but U2 are the only band whose entire catalogue I know by heart. The first song on The Unforgettable Fire, "A Sort of Homecoming", I know backward and forward  it's so rousing, brilliant, and beautiful. It's one of the first songs I played to my unborn baby." Martin also comments on Bono's effect on his own charity and political involvement he is even known to joke with friends referring to himself as "Crono".[11]Martin is very vocal about his love for Norwegian new wave/Synthpop band a-ha. In 2005 he stated the following in an interview: "I found myself in Amsterdam the other day and I put a-ha's first record on. I just remembered how much I loved it. It's incredible songwriting. Everyone asks what inspired us, what we've been trying to steal from and what we listened to as we were growing up  the first band I ever loved was a-ha."[13] Martin has also performed live together with Magne Furuholmen of a-ha. In November 2011, he stated that "back when we didn't have any hits of our own we used to play a-ha songs."[14]He is also known to be a fan of artists such as English alternative rock bands Oasis and Muse,[15] Irish pop group Westlife,[16] English band Radiohead, British pop groups Girls Aloud[17][18] and Take That,[19] and Canadian indie rock band Arcade Fire. Solo artists Martin likes include Leona Lewis,[20] Noel Gallagher, Kylie Minogue,[21] Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan and Hank Williams.[15]Coldplay performed R.E.M.'s "Nightswimming" with Michael Stipe on their Austin City Limits performance. During the show, Martin called "Nightswimming" "the greatest song ever written".[22]Martin and Coldplay guitarist Jonny Buckland made cameo appearances in the film Shaun of the Dead as supporters of the fictional charity ZombAid.[23] Martin has a second cameo in this film as a Zombie.[23] In 2006 Martin had a cameo role in the second series episode four of the Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant created comedy Extras. He also appears singing in the closing credits of the 2009 film Brno alongside Bono, Sting, Slash, Snoop Dogg, and Elton John.[24] Martin also played one gig with the "Sid James Experience".Martin has been particularly outspoken on issues of fair trade and has campaigned for Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign. He traveled to Ghana and Haiti to meet farmers and view the effects of unfair trade practices.[25] When performing he usually has variations of "Make Trade Fair", "MTF" or an equal sign written on the back of his left hand and the letters "MTF" can be seen emblazoned on his piano.[26]He was a vocal critic of President George W. Bush and the war in Iraq. Martin was a strong supporter of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, most notably during his acceptance speech for the 2004 Grammy Awards Record of the Year, accepting for "Clocks". Martin also supported the Democratic Party candidate for President in 2008, giving a shout-out to Barack Obama at the end of a performance of "Yellow" on 25 October 2008 episode of Saturday Night Live.[27]On 1 April 2006, The Guardian reported that Martin was backing the British Conservative Party leader David Cameron and had written a new theme song for the party titled "Talk to David".[28][29] This was later revealed to be an April Fool's joke. Whilst touring Australia in March 2009, Martin and the rest of Coldplay were the opening act at the Sound Relief benefit concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney, for the bushfires and floods in Victoria and Queensland.Martin appeared in a video for the "Robin Hood Tax" campaign, which proposes a tax on stock trades in the United States.[30] This tax is aimed at leveling the field between the so-called "1% and 99%". Days later, Martin and wife Gwyneth Paltrow bought a 10.45 million dollar home in an upscale neighborhood of Los Angeles.[31]Martin is married to Gwyneth Paltrow. The couple married on 5 December 2003.[32] Their daughter, Apple Blythe Alison Martin, was born on 14 May 2004 in London.[33] Their second child, Moses Bruce Anthony Martin, was born on 8 April 2006 in New York City.[34] Simon Pegg and Martin's bandmate Jonny Buckland are Apple's godfathers.[35][36] Martin is a longtime friend of Pegg, having met him in 2001, and appears in one of Pegg's movies,Shaun of the Dead,[23] along with Buckland.Martin does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol.[37] PETA declared him to be the World's Sexiest Vegetarian in 2005.[38]Martin was raised as a Catholic but has since lapsed. In a 2005 Rolling Stone magazine interview, Martin said of his religious views: "I definitely believe in God. How can you look at anything and not be overwhelmed by the miraculousness of it?"[39] In the same interview he spoke of going through a period of spiritual confusion, stating "I went through a weird patch, starting when I was about sixteen to twenty-two, of getting God, religion, superstition, judgement all confused".[39] However, in a 2008 interview he stated:Following the said interview, he released a text message declaring himself an "all-theist", a word of his invention meaning that he believes in "everything".[40]Martin often suffers from insomnia and has undergone sleep therapy.[41] He has said in interviews that ideas for songs most often come to him at night, and that he also often has nightmares about performances going wrong.[41]Martin is a supporter of the Liberal Democrats, a centre-left political party.[42]In a 2012 interview with the British tabloid Daily Mail, Martin revealed that he has had tinnitus for the past ten years and he developed it from listening to loud music when he was a teenager. He brings strong awareness to this condition and warns youngsters to avoid the same fate, while also protecting his own children's hearing with headphones.1 Early life2 Recording career

The Legend of Korra is an American animated television series that premiered on the Nickelodeon television network on April 14, 2012.[2] It was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko as a sequel to their previous show, Avatar: The Last Airbender, which aired on the same network from 2005 to 2008. Like its predecessor, the series is set in a fictional world where some people are able to "bend"manipulate the elements of water, earth, fire, or air. Only one person, the "Avatar," can manipulate all four elements, and he or she is responsible for maintaining the balance in the world. The series follows Korra, the current incarnation of the Avatar, as she travels to the metropolis of Republic City to learn airbending and face an anti-bender revolutionary group called the "Equalists."[3][4]The series, whose style is strongly influenced by Japanese animation,[5] was announced at San Diego Comic-Con in 2010 as Avatar: Legend of Korra.[6] It was initially conceived as a miniseries of 12 episodes,[7] but is now set to run for 52 episodes separated into two seasons.[8] The creators separated each season into two "books," each of which tells a separate story. Several producers and voice actors from the previous series, including designer Joaquim Dos Santos and composer Jeremy Zuckerman, returned to work on The Legend of Korra.[9]The Legend of Korra was initially conceived as a 12-episode miniseries. Nickelodeon later expanded it to a full 26-episode season, and in July 2012 again to two 26-episode seasons. While Nickelodeon divides the series in two seasons for administrative purposes, the creators conceive of it as consisting of four separate "books" composed of 12 to 14 episodes ("chapters"), with each book telling a stand-alone story. The Legend of Korra is intended to conclude with the fourth book.[10]The Legend of Korra is set in the fictional world of Avatar: The Last Airbender. The world is separated into four nations: the (Northern and Southern) Water Tribes, the Air Nomads, the Earth Kingdom and the Fire Nation. The focus of the series is "bending," the ability of some humans (and animals) to telekinetically manipulate the element associated with their nation (water, earth, fire or air). Bending is carried out using spiritual and physical exercises, which are portrayed in the series as similar to Chinese and other Asian martial arts.Only one person, the "Avatar," can bend all four elements. Cyclically reincarnating among the world's four nations, the Avatar is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. Like its predecessor, The Legend of Korra focuses on the current incarnation of the Avatar: Korra, a 17-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe. At the start of the series, she has mastered waterbending, earthbending, and firebending, but must complete her training by learning airbending from Tenzin, the youngest child of Aang and Katara from the original series.[3]The series is mostly set in Republic City, the capital of the United Republic of Nations, a state that emerged after the end of the war that occurred in Avatar: The Last Airbender. Its capital, Republic City, a metropolis described as "what if Manhattan had happened in Asia" by the series' creators,[11] has become a melting pot for people of all nations. The residents are united by their passion for "pro-bending," a spectator sport in which two teams composed of one earthbender, waterbender, and firebender try to throw each other out of a ring using bending.The series opens with a montage introducing Korra as the Avatar and showing that she has mastered every element except airbending. It is then revealed that due to problems in Republic City, Tenzin will not be able to move to the Southern Water Tribe and teach Korra airbending. As a result, Korra sneaks out and runs away to Republic City so that Tenzin can train her there. Once there, Korra clashes with police chief Lin Beifong (the daughter of Toph from Avatar: The Last Airbender) after dispensing vigilante justice to the local triads. Shortly thereafter, the two main antagonists of the season are introduced: the Equalists, an underground activist movement; and Tarrlok, an ambitious politician. The Equalists are non-benders led by a mysterious masked man, Amon. Their goal is to bring about "equality" between benders and non-benders. Councilman Tarrlok believes in aggressive tactics for bringing the Equalists to justice, despite protests from his pacifist colleague Tenzin, Korra's airbending trainer. As Korra explores Republic City, she meets the brothers Mako and Bolin and joins their pro-bending team, the "Fire Ferrets." They are successful in the league, but romantic tensions among them and Asami, Mako's girlfriend, put a strain on their relationship.As the story progresses, Korra discovers that Amon has the power to remove a person's bending ability. Tarrlok cajoles Korra to join his anti-Equalist "task force," and the Equalists begin using terrorist tactics, climaxing in an attack on the pro-bending arena, where Amon strips the winning team of their bending. But when Tarrlok continues indiscriminately repressing non-benders, Korra refuses to continue supporting him. After Tarrlok imprisons her friends to blackmail her, they fight. Tarrlok overpowers Korra with bloodbending, an illegal form of waterbending, and kidnaps her, framing the Equalists. Tenzin, Lin, and Korra's friends eventually discover that Tarrlok is lying, but as they do Amon arrives at Tarrlok's hideout and removes Tarrlok's bending. Korra escapes, only to find Republic City facing an Equalist military coup.In the two-part finale of Book One: Air, naval reinforcements from the United Forces, led by Zuko's grandson Iroh, are defeated by Equalist sea mines and biplanes. Attempting to find Amon, Korra learns that Tarrlok and Amon are both sons of the bloodbender Yakone, who was defeated 42 years ago by Avatar Aang, as well as water- and bloodbenders. In a showdown with Amon at one of his rallies, Amon is able to strip Korra of her power to bend all elements but in desperation she unlocks her airbending. After Mako and Korra manage to overpower and publicly unmask Amon as a waterbender, Amon flees with Tarrlok, who later detonates their boat on the open sea. The despondent Korra finally manages to establish spiritual contact with her predecessor, Aang, who restores her bending powers, allowing her to do the same for Amon's other victims.The Legend of Korra was co-created and produced by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko at Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank, California. Animation work was mostly done by South Korean animation studio Studio Mir. Production of the series was announced at the annual Comic-Con in San Diego on July 22, 2010. It was originally due for release in October 2011.[6][12] Tentatively titled Avatar: Legend of Korra at the time, it was intended to be a twelve-episode[7] mini series set in the same fictional universe as the original show,[12] but seventy years later.[13] The show's premiere was delayed to April 14, 2012, to permit the addition of 14 episodes.[12] At the San Diego Comic-Con 2011, the creators confirmed that the first twelve episodes would constitute the first book and the other fourteen a second book. Also it was revealed that the title would be changed to The Last Airbender: Legend of Korra. In March 2012, it was renamed again to its final title: The Legend of Korra.The show is darker-themed than the original show, but with a balance between mature themes and a sense of fun and adventure. It was announced early on that the show's creators write all of the episodes themselves and that filler episodes would be omitted, allowing for a more concise story.[14] However, when the series was expanded from its original 12-episode schedule to 26 (and eventually 52), more writers were brought in so that the creators could focus on design work.[15] Joaquim Dos Santos and Kihyun Ryu, who worked on the animation and design of the original series, are also involved in this show, as is storyboarder Ian Graham. Jeremy Zuckerman, who composed the soundtrack for the original series as part of "The Track Team," also returned to score The Legend of Korra.[16]The Legend of Korra is produced mainly as traditional animation, with most frames drawn on paper in Korea by the animators at Studio Mir and scanned for digital processing. The series makes occasional use of computer-generated imagery for complex scenes, most noticeably in the animations of the pro-bending arena or the Satomobile factory.While The Legend of Korra is produced in the U.S. and therefore not a work of Japanese animation ("anime") in the strict sense, The Escapist magazine argued that the series is so strongly influenced by anime that it would otherwise easily be classified as such: Its protagonists (a superpowered heroine, her group of talented, supporting friends, a near-impervious villain who wants to reshape the world), its themes (family, friendship, fear, and death) and the quality of its voice acting as well as the style of its visuals are very similar to those of leading anime series such as Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Bleach or Trigun.[5] A notable difference to such series is the absence of lengthy opening and ending sequences set to J-pop songs:[5] to save broadcast time, The Legend of Korra's openings and endings last only a few seconds. The series mostly abstains from using the visual tropes characteristic of anime, but does rarely use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.Like Avatar, The Legend of Korra is scored by The Track Team, the partnership of composers Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn. As with Avatar, no soundtrack album has been published or announced to date.Bryan Konietzko and Mike DiMartino's concept for the score was to blend traditional Chinese music with early jazz. On that basis, Zuckerman and Wynn composed a score combining elements of Dixieland, traditional Chinese music and Western orchestration, performed mainly by a string sextet and various Chinese solo instruments.[17]The first twelve episodes (Book 1: Air) of the first season aired in the U.S. on Nickelodeon between April 14, 2012 and June 23, 2012, and are available in the U.S. on the channel's website and through the Hulu Plus service. They are to be broadcast in other countries on the local Nickelodeon channels beginning in August 2012.In June 2012, Nickelodeon began producing the second part of the first season (Book 2: Spirits),[18][19] which is expected to air sometime in 2013.[19][20]In November 2012, the entertainment news website Hypable noted that a trailer for a The Legend of Korra DVD release had surfaced on the Internet. The trailer did not indicate when the DVD would become available.[21]Janet Varney was cast as Korra, the series' 17-year-old "headstrong and rebellious" protagonist,[1] and Aang's successor as the Avatar. Her character was inspired by Bryan Konietzko's "pretty tough" sister, and by female MMA fighters, notably Gina Carano.[19][22] The series focuses on Korra and her friends Mako, Bolin and Asami. Mako was named after Mako Iwamatsu, the voice actor for Iroh in the original series, who died during the production of Avatar: The Last Airbender's production. Mako is voiced by David Faustino and is described as "dark and brooding," having grown up on the streets.[1][23] His brother, Bolin, who is voiced by P. J. Byrne, has an opposite personality and is described as lighthearted, humorous, and "always having a lady on his arm."[1][24] Asami Sato, the only main character who is a non-bender, is voiced by Seychelle Gabriel. She is the only daughter of the wealthy industrialist Hiroshi Sato.[1] The other main characters are Korra's airbending teacher Tenzin, voiced by J. K. Simmons, and Republic City police chief Lin Beifong, voiced by Mindy Sterling. Additionally, Dee Bradley Baker, who voiced a number of animals in the original series, returned in The Legend of Korra to voice Naga and Pabu, Korra's and Bolin's animal friends. Pabu was inspired by Futa, a famous standing Japanese red panda.[25]Among the other recurring characters, the first to be introduced is Tenzin's wife Pema (Maria Bamford) and her children Jinora (Kiernan Shipka), Ikki (Darcy Rose Byrnes), Meelo (Logan Wells), and Rohan. Jinora and Ikki are both girls and airbenders. Jinora is calmer and an avid reader[26][27] and Ikki is described as "fun, crazy, and a fast talker."[27] Meelo (also an airbender) and Rohan (born during the finale of Book One: Air) are Pema's sons. Korra and her friends are supported by General Iroh, a firebender and General of the "United Forces." He is voiced by Dante Basco, the voice actor of Zuko in the original series, and is described as "a swashbuckling hero-type guy."[28][29][30] He is named after Iroh, Zuko's uncle in the original series.[18]Book One: Air features two main antagonists: Amon, the mysterious masked leader of the "Equalist" movement; and Tarrlok, a suave politician. Both are waterbenders, bloodbenders, and brothers who were raised in the Northern Water Tribe. Their father is Yakone, a criminal voiced by Clancy Brown who is seen in the series through Korra's visions of Republic City 42 years before the series' start. Amon, whose real name is Noatak, is voiced by Steve Blum. He is shown in the series to have the power to remove an individual's bending.[1][31] Tarrlok, who is also voiced by Dee Bradley Baker, is the Northern Water Tribe's representative on Republic City's governing council. He is an ambitious and charismatic politician who resorts to increasingly repressive methods to counter Amon and the Equalist movement.[32] Other recurring antagonists include the "Lieutenant" (Lance Henriksen), Amon's second-in-command, and Hiroshi Sato (Daniel Dae Kim), Asami's father who joins the Equalists because firebenders killed his wife. Sato is the self-made owner of Future Industries, a company that makes the series' version of the Model-T automobile: the "Satomobile." The character was inspired by Theodore Roosevelt and by the Japanese industrialists Keita Goto and Iwasaki Yatar.[33]David Hinckley of the New York Daily News wrote that the "visually striking" series is "full of little tricks and nuances that only true fans will notice and savor, but nothing prevents civilians from enjoying it as well."[34] Brian Lowry of Variety felt that the series "represents a bit more ambitious storytelling for older kids, and perhaps a few adults with the geek gene."[35] Prior to the first book's finale, Scott Thill of Wired hailed The Legend of Korra as "the smartest cartoon on TV," able to address adults' spiritual and sociopolitical concerns while presenting an "alternately riveting and hilarious ride packed with fantasy naturalism, steampunk grandeur, kinetic conflicts, sci-fi weaponry and self-aware comedy."[36] Thill proposed that the Equalists' cause reflected the recent issues in the Occupy movement, and DiMartino responded that though the series was written before Occupy Wall Street began, he agreed that the show similarly depicted "a large group of people who felt powerless up against a relatively small group of people in power."[37] Alyssa Rosenberg praised the show for examining issues of class in an urban setting, and a guest post in her column later argued that the struggle between Korra and Amon's Equalists reflected some of the ideas of John Rawls' "luck egalitarianism," praising the show for tackling moral issues of inequality and redistribution.[38][39]Elements of the first book that received particular praise were the exceptional quality of the animation, the background paintings[40] and the martial-arts action scenes,[41] as well as the series' innovative and engrossing visual design and style.[40] The writers were credited for finding a believable balance between magic and technology[42] and for their mature and nuanced portrayal of romantic relationships and conflicts.[43][41] Critics also praised the writers' willingness and ability to tackle difficult themes such as social unrest,[44] terrorism, Tarrlok's murdersuicide of Amon,[45] as well as (depending on the interpretation of a scene from the season finale) Korra considering suicide after losing her bending.[46][47][48]The first book overall, in particular the finale, received high praise by critics, but did get a few criticisms. Kotaku editor Kirk Hamilton, in a piece discussing his perceived flaws of the first season, wrote that he felt the series failed to tackle its central conflicts in a meaningful way, the mix of comedy and drama, the greater amount of character arcs in a shorter series, and the neat ending.[49] Raz Greenberg of Strange Horizons commented that Korra seemed as though she had things too easy in life in comparison to Aang, and also criticized the show's rapid pacing. [50] Max Nicholson of IGN largely praised the series' writing, animation, humor, setting, and characters, and even addressed criticisms of the ending by pointing out that several things accused of being a deus ex machina had been foreshadowed throughout the series. However, he did feel that the love triangle arc between Mako, Asami, and Korra fell flat and that the pro-bending arc felt superfluous while praising the way it led into the greater war arc with Amon. He also felt that Mako, despite being a major character, felt underwritten. Lauren Davis of io9 was extremely positive about the arc of the characters and the setting, though also felt disappointed about the show's pacing.[42]Book One: Air drew an average of 4.3 million viewers per episode. This was the highest audience total for an animated show in the U.S. in 2012.[51]Book One: Air is to be adapted as two novels by Erica David, aimed at readers aged twelve and up. The novelizations are to be published by Random House in 2013:[52]In August 2012, Variety reported that Paramount Animation, a sister company of Nickelodeon, was starting development of several animated movies, with budgets of around US$100 million. According to Variety, a possible candidate for one of the films is The Legend of Korra.[53] Series creator Bryan Konietzko wrote on his blog that while he and Michael Dante DiMartino "would love to write/direct an animated Korra feature film sometime," no such movie was in development.[54]Action/AdventureFantasy/SteampunkComedy-dramaMichael Dante DiMartinoBryan KonietzkoMichael Dante DiMartinoBryan KonietzkoJoaquim Dos SantosKi Hyun RyuJanet VarneyJ.

How I Met Your Mother is an American sitcom that premiered on CBS on September 19, 2005, created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays, and directed by Pamela Fryman.Set in Manhattan, How I Met Your Mother follows the social and romantic lives of Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) and his friends Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), and Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris).[1] As a framing device, the main character, Ted,[1] using voiceover narration by Bob Saget, in the year 2030 recounts to his son and his daughter the events that led to his meeting their mother.Known for its unique structure and eccentric humor, How I Met Your Mother has been a critical success, having received positive reviews throughout most of its run. The show has been nominated for seven Emmy Awards, winning six. In 2012, the series won the People's Choice Award for Best TV Network Comedy and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Best Male Comedy Actor.[2]How I Met Your Mother was inspired by Carter Bays' and Craig Thomas' idea to "write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York."[3] The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[4][5] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her, but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work, and was available.[4]MacLaren's, a bar in the middle of New York, in which some of the show is set, is based on a bar named McGee's.[6] It has a mural that Bays and Thomas both liked and wanted to incorporate into the show.[7] The name for the bar is from Carter Bays' assistant, Carl MacLaren; the bartender in the show is also named Carl.[8]Each episode is usually shot over three days in the Los Angeles-based Soundstage Studio 22[9] and features upwards of 50 scenes with quick transitions and flashbacks. However, the "Pilot" episode was filmed at CBS Radford.[10] The laugh track is later created by recording an audience being shown the final edited episode. Thomas claims that shooting before a live audience would be impossible because of the structure of the show and the numerous flashforwards in each episode and because doing so "would blur the line between 'audience' and 'hostage situation'."[11] Later seasons started filming in front of an audience on occasion when smaller sets are used.The theme song is a portion of "Hey Beautiful" by The Solids, of which Bays and Thomas are members. Episodes from Season 1 generally started with the opening credits. A cold opening has been used since Season 2. Viewers then occasionally see Ted's children on a couch and hear him talking to them, telling the story of how he met their mother. Alternatively, scenes from previous episodes or shots of New York City with Ted narrating over the top are shown. Thomas has explicitly said Future Ted is an unreliable narrator since he is trying to tell a story that happened over 20 years earlier;[12] this has been a plot point in several episodes such as "The Goat", "Oh Honey", "How I Met Everyone Else" and "The Mermaid Theory". Nevertheless, Thomas has also emphasized maintaining a coherent and consistent universe, and trying to avoid continuity errors, based on his experiences of being a fan of other shows.[13]A scene directly relating to the identity of the mother, involving Ted's future children, was filmed near the beginning of Season 2 for the show's eventual series finale.[14] This was primarily done because the teenage actors portraying them will be adults by the time the final season is shot.[15]During the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike, How I Met Your Mother shut down production; but, when the strike ended, the show returned on March 17, 2008, with nine new episodes.[16] A change in timeslot was also announced, to 8:30 pm ET/7:30 pm CT, flip-flopping from the summer schedule with The Big Bang Theory.[17] CBS renewed the show for a fourth season on May 14, 2008,[18] which premiered on September 22, 2008.[19]In September 2008, it was announced that Lifetime Television had purchased the right to rerun How I Met Your Mother at a rate of about $725,000 per episode.[20] The four-year syndication contract stipulated that the studio deliver at least 110 half-hour episodes by the year 2010, and allowed for up to eight seasons of the show. At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[21] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was announced.[22] On May 20, 2009, CBS announced that How I Met Your Mother would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new comedy Accidentally on Purpose. On January 12, 2010, the show hit the milestone of its 100th episode. It was also announced that the series would return for a sixth season on CBS.[23] In response to being syndicated, Thomas said, "We're thrilled that it will live on in other forms," and they were proud of the show and it was great to see the strong demand.[24] However, cast members have suggested the show will run for no more than eight seasons.[25]On September 13, 2010, reruns of the series began airing on local U.S. broadcast television stations and on Chicago-based cable superstation WGN America. Featured in these airings are vanity cards previously unseen in the CBS and Lifetime airings due to marginalized credit sequences used by the two networks. Shown in between the closing credits and the production company credits, these vanity cards show portions of "The Bro Code", a list of rules frequently referenced by Harris' character, Barney Stinson, on how men should interact with each other, with an emphasis on activities involving pursuing members of the opposite sex. The opening theme song for the syndicated reruns is also slightly edited, running shorter and not using all the pictures seen in the opening montage that runs on DVD and the original CBS broadcasts. The episodes are also slightly edited, leaving out a few details.One of the series' ongoing traditions involves giving guest roles to actors from various Joss Whedon productions, many of whom co-starred with Hannigan on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Bays attributes this to their being "huge fans" and to those casts representing "a big talent pool".[26]Another tradition involves the use of euphemisms for culturally sensitive issues. These include eating a sandwich for smoking marijuana and reading a magazine for masturbating (in the bathroom, where one would read a magazine) and "playing the bagpipes" for loud, raucous sex acts. These euphemisms, among others, have been used extensively throughout the series and have even been used as central plot themes, such as the episode "Benefits" in Season 4.On March 4, 2011, CBS announced that the show had been renewed for two more seasons,[27] with the seventh season premiering with back-to-back episodes on September 19, 2011.[2]On July 27, 2011, it was announced that the FX channel had picked up the show for syndication. FX began airing the show on September 5, 2011.[28]In the year 2030, Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) sits his daughter and son down to tell them the story of how he met their mother.The series begins in 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from his college years; Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher and aspiring artist. Lily and Marshall have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall finally proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), whom he met in the restroom at a bar four years earlier. Barney is a serial womanizer who concocts elaborate con games, usually involving costumes and fake identities, designed to bed women, whom he discards immediately afterward.Ted begins his search for his perfect soul mate and meets an ambitious young reporter from Canada, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), with whom he quickly falls in love. Robin, however, doesn't want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Future Ted reveals that Robin is not the mother after referring to her as "Aunt Robin".Ted begins dating a baker, Victoria (Ashley Williams), whom he meets at a friend's wedding, causing Robin to become jealous and realize she does have feelings for Ted. Victoria, having been offered a fellowship in pastry-making, moves to Germany; and she and Ted try a long-distance relationship. Once Ted learns Robin has feelings for him, he tells her he broke up with Victoria, even though he hasn't. They almost have sex when Victoria calls and Robin answers, mistaking Ted's phone for her own. Ted and Victoria then break up and an angry Robin distances herself from Ted, but they eventually make up and decide to date.Meanwhile, Lily begins to wonder if she's missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall, and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking up with Marshall in the process. The season ends with Ted coming back to the apartment, the morning after spending the night with Robin for the first time, to find Marshall sitting in the rain with Lily's engagement ring, devastated by their sudden break up.Ted and Robin are now a couple; meanwhile, a heartbroken Marshall tries to continue his life without Lily. After enduring numerous emotional breakdowns, Marshall's friends step in, and Barney, using sly catch phrases and pick up lines, tries to get Marshall back in the dating game. Later, Lily, after finally realizing she is not meant to be an artist, returns to New York. She is reunited with Marshall, their engagement is reinstated. When Robin refuses to go to the mall or explain why, Marshall suspects she is married, and Barney suspects she has performed in adult films. They both bet on it, issuing Lily as "Slap Bet Commissioner." Lily oversees the search for the truth, as they discover that Robin was a teenage pop star named "Robin Sparkles", and Marshall eventually earns the right to slap Barney 5 times whenever he wants to. It is revealed Barney has a gay half-brother named James (Wayne Brady) and that he believes that Bob Barker is his father, unaware that his mother lied to him, and takes a trip to California to be a contestant on The Price is Right to meet his "father." While on the show, Barney wins all of the prizes and gives them to Lily and Marshall as a 'happy early wedding' present.In the season finale, Ted reveals to Barney that he and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on marriage and kids. They didn't tell anyone in order to avoid taking attention away from Lily and Marshall's wedding. The season ends with Barney excited at the prospect of Ted and himself being single guys on the town again, and ends the season with Barney saying, "This is going to be legen- wait for it..."Barney begins the season with the word, "-dary!" Robin returns from a trip to Argentina with her new boyfriend, Gael (Enrique Iglesias), and Ted must adjust to life as just her friend, while watching Robin and Gael fawning over each other. Marshall and Lily decide to move out on their own, falling in love with a place they can't afford. Robin learns of Lily's bad credit rating due to her compulsive shopping for designer brands, and forces Lily to tell Marshall. Despite this, they are able to finally secure their dream apartment, only to discover it's in a bad location and more poorly constructed than they thought (the floor is tilted). Barney is slapped for the third time on Thanksgiving, which Marshall dubs "Slapsgiving."Ted tells his children he met their mother through a story concerning her yellow umbrella. He finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick's Day party where his future wife was, although they did not meet. Ted attempts to woo Stella (Sarah Chalke), a dermatologist he sees to remove an embarrassing butterfly tattoo. This culminates in a memorable "two-minute date," which incorporates small talk, dinner, a movie, coffee, two cab rides, and a goodnight kiss, all within two minutes. Robin sleeps with Barney after he comforts her following a break-up with a past Canadian love; Ted is infuriated, and decides to stop being friends with Barney. Meanwhile, an unknown woman begins to sabotage Barney's attempts to hook up. His saboteur is revealed to be Abby (Britney Spears), Stella's receptionist, with a vendetta against him for not calling her after they had sex.In the season finale, Ted gets into a car accident and ends up in hospital, Subsequently Barney gets hit by a bus on the way to visit him and ends up receiving treatment in the same hospital. Ted realizes Barney really cares about him and they renew their friendship. It is revealed Barney has true feelings for Robin, while Ted proposes to Stella in an arcade.Stella says yes to Ted's proposal. Robin takes a new job in Japan, but quickly resigns and returns to New York to attend Ted's wedding, after realizing how much she misses her friends. Stella leaves Ted at the altar to get back together with Tony (Jason Jones), the father of her daughter. Barney struggles with his feelings for Robin as his company shifts him to the management team of a new acquisition, Goliath National Bank (GNB), where Marshall has accepted a position.Marshall and Lily move to their new apartment and debate over whether or not they're ready to have children. Robin becomes roommates with Ted and gets a job as an anchor for a 4 AM news show after Barney sends out her video resume.

Barney attempts to make them stop fighting to prevent this, revealing to Ted his love for Robin.Ted finds out Lily has sabotaged all of his relationships with anyone she doesn't approve of and indirectly may have inspired his breakup with Robin. Robin and Ted end up talking about it, causing their friendship to begin moving toward a positive note. After Barney finally sleeps with his 200th woman (and rubs it in the face of the childhood bully who taunted him into pursuing it), he begins to question the purpose of the remainder of his life, leaving him more certain of his feelings for Robin.Ted, while carrying the yellow umbrella, bumps into Stella and Tony. Tony later decides to visit him, sympathizing with Ted over his loss of Stella. Tony offers him a job as a professor of architecture, which Ted initially turns down.In the season finale Robin finds out that Barney loves her, and initially refuses to commit to anything but a sex-only relationship; they seemingly end up together anyway. Ted decides that being an architect is leading nowhere, and finally decides instead to become a college professor. The finale ends with Ted preparing to teach his first class and Future Ted revealing to his kids that one of the women in the class is their mother.Ted begins his job as an architectural professor, standing in the middle of a classroom although the mother was present, it turns out to be an economics class as he's in the wrong lecture hall. Barney and Robin have had a sexual relationship throughout the summer and Lily locks them in a room, forcing them to come to terms with their relationship. After a rough patch they decide to break up. Robin describes it instead as "two friends getting back together." Barney immediately goes back to his old ways, using the playbook to score with women. Throughout the season Barney and Robin show feelings of regret over their break-up.Ted dates a graduate student named Cindy (Rachel Bilson) and it is revealed her roommate is his future wife.

HTC Sense is a graphical user interface developed by HTC Corporation for mobile devices running Android, Brew and Windows Mobile.Based on the TouchFLO 3D design,[1] HTC refers to HTC Sense as both a user interface in itself[2] and also as a user experience layer on top of TouchFLO 3D.[3]Announced June 24, 2009, the first phone running Android to feature HTC Sense was the HTC Hero,[4][5] and the first Windows Mobile phone to feature HTC Sense (an updated TouchFLO) was the HTC HD2, announced October 6, 2009.[6]while we get the touchFlo 3d with information featured on separate tabs, the Android version presents information through Android desktop widgets and applications, and includes launcher, app drawer and lock screen replacements.At the Mobile World Congress 2010, HTC debuted their new updated HTC Sense UI on the HTC Desire and HTC Legend, with an upgrade available for the Hero and Magic. The new version was based upon Android 2.1 and featured interface features such as the Friend Stream widget, which aggregated Twitter, Facebook and Flickr information and Leap, which allows access to all home screens at once.[7]When the HTC Sensation was released, it featured HTC Sense 3.0, which added interface elements, including an updated lock screen that allows applications to be pinned directly to it for easier access. The HTC EVO 3D also features Sense 3.0.Two versions of Sense were developed for Android 4.0. Sense 4.0, included on HTC's new devices beginning with the "One" series (such as the HTC One X), was designed to provide a refreshed and more minimalist look closer to stock Android than previous versions, while integrating features provided by Android 4.0.[8][9] Sense 3.6, which was distributed through updates to older HTC phones, is designed to have a closer resemblance to previous versions of Sense.[10]Built atop Android 1.5 (codename Cupcake), it was released on the HTC Hero. This version of Sense featured a small number of apps with social capabilities that connected to Facebook and Twitter.Espresso was the codename for the version of Sense running atop T-Mobile myTouch devices. It debuted on the T-Mobile myTouch 3G Slide (HTC Espresso) and the T-Mobile myTouch 4G (HTC Glacier). It features all of the widgets and apps of regular Sense, but the color of apps and certain interface elements are blue instead of green. "Pushed in" apps appear on the home screen.Built atop Android 2.1 (codename Eclair), this release debuted on the HTC Desire and HTC Legend and provided upgrades for the HTC Hero and HTC Magic. It introduced FriendStream and the Leap feature similar to Macintosh OS X's Mission Control.Built atop Android 2.3 (codename Gingerbread), 3.0 debuted on the HTC Sensation. This version introduced HTC Watch, a movie streaming service, and updated the lockscreen with app shortcuts for easier access. Additional lockscreen styles included widgets that display content such as weather and photos. It also features 3D homescreen transition effects when swiping among homescreens.Sense 3.6 was built for older HTC devices atop Android 4.0 (codename Ice Cream Sandwich [ICS]). It is similar to Sense 3.0, but features a new homescreen with pinnable apps, like that of Sense 4.0. It was first featured on the HTC Sensation and HTC Vivid.Built atop Android 4.0, it debuted on the HTC One X, HTC One S, HTC Evo 4G LTE, and HTC One V. Lighter and faster than past versions, it toned down the 3D transitions, introduced a new home screen with apps pinnable to the dock, and offered a new way to place widgets.Announced on August 18, 2012 for HTC One X, HTC One S, and HTC Evo 4G LTE got Android 4.0.4 and HTC Sense 4.1Announced on 2012 for HTC One X+, updates with Sense 4+ was also released for the HTC One X.1 Versions

Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt (listen(helpinfo); September 14, 1769  May 6, 1859) was a Prussian geographer, naturalist and explorer, and the younger brother of the Prussian minister, philosopher and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt (17671835). Humboldt's quantitative work on botanical geography laid the foundation for the field of biogeography.Between 1799 and 1804, Humboldt travelled extensively in Latin America, exploring and describing it for the first time in a manner generally considered to be a modern scientific point of view. His description of the journey was written up and published in an enormous set of volumes over 21 years. He was one of the first to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined (South America and Africa in particular). Later, his five-volume work, Kosmos (1845), attempted to unify the various branches of scientific knowledge. Humboldt supported and worked with other scientists, including Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac, Justus von Liebig, Louis Agassiz, Matthew Fontaine Maury and Georg von Neumayer, most notably, Aim Bonpland, with whom he conducted much of his scientific exploration.Humboldt was born in Berlin in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. His father, Alexander Georg von Humboldt, belonged to a prominent Pomeranian family; a major in the Prussian Army, he was rewarded for his services in the Seven Years' War with the post of Royal Chamberlain. He married the daughter of the Prussian general adjutant, von Schweder.[1] In 1766, he married Maria Elizabeth Colomb, the widow of Baron von Hollwede, and they had two sons. The money of Baron von Holwede, left to his former wife, was instrumental in funding Alexander's explorations, contributing more than 70% of Alexander's income.[citation needed]Due to his juvenile penchant for collecting and labelling plants, shells and insects, Alexander received the playful title of "the little apothecary". His father died in 1779, after which his mother saw to his education. Marked for a political career, he studied finance for six months at the University of Frankfurt (Oder); a year later, on April 25, 1789, he matriculated at Gttingen, then known for the lectures of C. G. Heyne and J. F. Blumenbach. His vast and varied interests were by this time fully developed, and during a vacation in 1789, he made a scientific excursion up the Rhine and produced the treatise Mineralogische Beobachtungen ber einige Basalte am Rhein (Brunswick, 1790) (Mineralogic Observations on Several Basalts on the River Rhine).Humboldt's passion for travel was confirmed by a friendship formed at Gttingen with Georg Forster, Heyne's son-in-law and the companion of Captain James Cook on Cook's second voyage. Thereafter, his talents were devoted to the purpose of preparing himself as a scientific explorer. With this emphasis, he studied commerce and foreign languages at Hamburg, geology at Technische Universitt Bergakademie Freiberg under A. G. Werner, anatomy at Jena under J. C. Loder and astronomy and the use of scientific instruments under F. X. von Zach and J. G. Khler. His researches into the vegetation of the mines of Freiberg led to the publication, in 1793, of his Florae Fribergensis Specimen. Long experimentation on muscular irritability, then recently discovered by Luigi Galvani, were contained in his Versuche ber die gereizte Muskel- und Nervenfaser (Berlin, 1797) (Experiments on the Frayed Muscle and Nerve Fibres), enriched in the French translation with notes by Blumenbach.In 1794 Humboldt was admitted to the famous Weimar coterie and contributed (June 7, 1795) to Schiller's new periodical, Die Horen, a philosophical allegory entitled Die Lebenskraft, oder der rhodische Genius. In the summer of 1790 he paid a short visit to England in the company of Forster. In 1792 and 1797 he was in Vienna; in 1795 he made a geological and botanical tour through Switzerland and Italy. He had obtained in the meantime official employment by appointment as assessor of mines at Berlin, February 29, 1792. Although this service to the state was regarded by him as only an apprenticeship to the service of science, he fulfilled its duties with such conspicuous ability that not only did he rise rapidly to the highest post in his department, but he was also entrusted with several important diplomatic missions. The death of his mother, on November 19, 1796, set him free to follow the bent of his genius, and severing his official connections, he waited for an opportunity to fulfil his long-cherished dream of travel.On the postponement of Captain Nicolas Baudin's proposed voyage of circumnavigation, which he had been officially invited to accompany, Humboldt left Paris for Marseille with Aim Bonpland, the designated botanist of the frustrated expedition, hoping to join Napoleon Bonaparte in Egypt. Means of transport, however, were not forthcoming, and the two travellers eventually found their way to Madrid, where the unexpected patronage of the minister Don Mariano Luis de Urquijo convinced them to make Spanish America the scene of their explorations.Armed with powerful recommendations from the King of Spain, they sailed in the Pizarro from A Corua, on June 5, 1799, stopped six days on the island of Tenerife to climb the volcano Teide, and landed at Cuman, Venezuela, on July 16. Humboldt visited the mission at Caripe and explored the Gucharo cavern, where he found the oil-bird, which he was to make known to science as Steatornis caripensis. Returning to Cuman, Humboldt observed, on the night of November 1112, a remarkable meteor shower (the Leonids). He proceeded with Bonpland to Caracas where he would climb the Avila mount with Andres Bello. In February 1800, Humboldt and Bonpland left the coast with the purpose of exploring the course of the Orinoco River. This trip, which lasted four months and covered 1,725 miles (2,776km) of wild and largely uninhabited country, had the important result of establishing the existence of the Casiquiare canal (a communication between the water-systems of the rivers Orinoco and Amazon), and of determining the exact position of the bifurcation, as well as documenting the life of several native tribes such as the Maipures and their extinct rivals the Atures (several words of the latter tribe were transferred to Humboldt by one parrot[2]). Around March 19, 1800, von Humboldt and Bonpland discovered and captured some electric eels. They both received potentially dangerous electric shocks during their investigations. Two months later they explored the territory of the Maypures and that of the then recently extinct Aturs Indians.On November 24, the two friends set sail for Cuba where they met fellow botanist and plant collector John Fraser,[3] and after a stay of some months they regained the mainland at Cartagena, Colombia. Ascending the swollen stream of the Magdalena River and crossing the frozen ridges of the Cordillera Real, they reached Quito on January 6, 1802, after a tedious and difficult journey. Their stay there was marked by the ascent of Pichincha and an attempt on Chimborazo. Humboldt and his party reached an altitude of 19,286 feet (5,878m), a world record at the time. The journey concluded with an expedition to the sources of the Amazon en route for Lima, Peru.[4] At Callao, Humboldt observed the transit of Mercury on November 9, and studied the fertilizing properties of guano, the subsequent introduction of which into Europe was due mainly to his writings. A tempestuous sea-voyage brought them to Mexico, where they resided for a year, travelling to different cities.Next, Humboldt made a short visit to the United States, staying in the White House as a guest of President Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson, a scientist himself, was delighted to have Humboldt as a guest and the two held numerous intense discussions on scientific matters. After six weeks, Humboldt set sail for Europe from the mouth of the Delaware and landed at Bordeaux on August 3, 1804.This memorable expedition may be regarded as having laid the foundation of the sciences of physical geography and meteorology. By his delineation (in 1817) of "isothermal lines", he at once suggested the idea and devised the means of comparing the climatic conditions of various countries. He first investigated the rate of decrease in mean temperature with the increase in elevation above sea level, and afforded, by his inquiries regarding the origin of tropical storms, the earliest clue to the detection of the more complicated law governing atmospheric disturbances in higher latitudes; while his essay on the geography of plants was based on the then novel idea of studying the distribution of organic life as affected by varying physical conditions. His discovery of the decrease in intensity of Earth's magnetic field from the poles to the equator was communicated to the Paris Institute in a memoir read by him on December 7, 1804, and its importance was attested by the speedy emergence of rival claims. His services to geology were based mainly on his attentive study of the volcanoes of the New World. He showed that they fell naturally into linear groups, presumably corresponding with vast subterranean fissures; and by his demonstration of the igneous origin of rocks previously held to be of aqueous formation, he contributed largely to the elimination of erroneous views, such as Neptunism.Humboldt is considered to be the "second discoverer of Cuba" due to all the scientific and social research he conducted on this Spanish colony. During an initial three-month stay at Havana, his first tasks were to properly survey that city and the nearby towns of Guanabacoa, Regla and Bejucal. He befriended Cuban landowner and thinker Francisco Arango y Parreo; together they visited the Guines area in south Havana, the valleys of Matanzas Province and the Valley of the Sugar Mills in Trinidad. Those three areas were, at the time, the first frontier of sugar production in the island. During those trips, Humboldt collected statistical information on Cuba's population, production, technology and trade, and with Arango, made suggestions for enhancing them. He predicted that the agricultural and commercial potential of Cuba was huge and could be vastly improved with proper leadership in the future. After traveling to the United States, Humboldt returned to Cuba for a second, shorter stay in April 1804. During this time he socialized with his scientific and landowner friends, conducted mineralogical surveys and finished his vast collection of the island's flora and fauna.Finally, Humboldt conducted a rudimentary census of the indigenous and European inhabitants in New Spain, and on May 5, 1804, he estimated the population to be six million individuals.[5][6]The editing and publication of the encyclopedic mass of scientific, political and archaeological material that had been collected by him during his absence from Europe was now Humboldt's most urgent desire. After a short trip to Italy with Gay-Lussac for the purpose of investigating the law of magnetic declination and a sojourn of two and a half years in his native city, he finally, in the spring of 1808, settled in Paris with the purpose of securing the scientific cooperation required for bringing his great work through the press. This colossal task, which he at first hoped would occupy but two years, eventually cost him twenty-one, and even then it remained incomplete. In these early years in Paris, he shared accommodation and a laboratory with his former rival, and now friend, Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac, both working together on the analysis of gases and the composition of the atmosphere.Alexander von Humboldt thought an approach to science was needed that could account for the harmony of nature among the diversity of the physical world. For Humboldt, "the unity of nature" meant that it was the interrelation of all physical sciencessuch as the conjoining between biology, meteorology and geologythat determined where specific plants grew. He found these relationships by unravelling myriad, painstakingly collected data,[7] data extensive enough that it became an enduring foundation upon which others could base their work. Humboldt viewed nature holistically, and tried to explain natural phenomena without the appeal to religious dogma. He believed in the central importance of observation, and as a consequence had amassed a vast array of the most sophisticated scientific instruments then available. Each had its own velvet lined box and was the most accurate and portable of its time; nothing quantifiable escaped measurement. According to Humboldt, everything should be measured with the finest and most modern instruments and sophisticated techniques available, for it was that collected data was the basis of all scientific understanding. This quantitative methodology would become known as "Humboldtian science." Humboldt wrote "Nature herself is sublimely eloquent. The stars as they sparkle in firmament fill us with delight and ecstasy, and yet they all move in orbit marked out with mathematical precision."[8]His critics say his writings contain fantastical descriptions of America, while leaving out its inhabitants. They claim Humboldt, coming from the Romantic school of thought, believed '...nature is perfect till man deforms it with care.'[9] In this line of thinking, they think he largely neglected the human societies amidst this nature. The writing style that describes the 'new world' without people is a trend among explorers both of the past and present. Views of indigenous peoples as 'savage' or 'unimportant' leaves them out of the historical picture.[9] In reality Humboldt dedicated large parts of his work to describing the conditions of slaves, Indians and society in general. He often showed his disgust for the slavery[10] and inhumane conditions in which Indians and others were treated and he often criticized the colonial policies.[11] Some of Humboldt's descriptions or assumptions were not accurate.[10]Humboldt was now one of the most famous men in Europe.[12] The acclaimed American painter Rembrandt Peale painted him during his European stay, between 1808 and 1810, as one of the most prominent figures in Europe at the time. A chorus of applause greeted him from every side. Academies, both native and foreign, were eager to enrol him among their members. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1810. King Frederick William III of Prussia conferred upon him the honour, without exacting the duties, attached to the post of royal chamberlain, together with a pension of 2,500 thalers, afterwards doubled. He refused the appointment of Prussian minister of public instruction in 1810. In 1814 he accompanied the allied sovereigns to London. Three years later he was summoned by the king of Prussia to attend him at the congress of Aachen. Humboldt was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822.[13] Again in the autumn of 1822 he accompanied the same monarch to the Congress of Verona, proceeded thence with the royal party to Rome and Naples and returned to Paris in the spring of 1823.Humboldt had long regarded the French capital as his true home. There he found not only scientific sympathy, but the social stimulus which his vigorous and healthy mind eagerly craved. He was equally in his element as the lion of the salons and as the savant of the Institut de France and the observatory. During that time he met in 1818, the young and brilliant Peruvian student of the Royal Mining School of Paris, Mariano Eduardo de Rivero y Ustariz. They became good friends. Subsequently von Humboldt acted as a mentor of the career of this promising Peruvian scientist. Thus, when at last he received from his sovereign a summons to join his court at Berlin, he obeyed indeed, but with deep and lasting regret. The provincialism of his native city was odious to him. He never ceased to rail against the bigotry without religion[clarification needed], aestheticism without culture, and philosophy without common sense, which he found dominant on the banks of the Spree. The unremitting benefits and sincere attachment of two well-meaning princes secured his gratitude but could not appease his discontent. At first he sought relief from the "nebulous atmosphere" of his new abode by frequent visits to Paris; but as years advanced, his excursions were reduced to accompanying the monotonous "oscillations" of the court between Potsdam and Berlin. On May 12, 1827, he settled permanently in the Prussian capital, where his first efforts were directed towards the furtherance of the science of terrestrial magnetism. For many years, it had been one of his favourite schemes to secure, by means of simultaneous observations at distant points, a thorough investigation of the nature and law of "magnetic storms" (a term invented by him to designate abnormal disturbances of Earth's magnetism). The meeting at Berlin, on September 18, 1828, of a newly formed scientific association, of which he was elected president, gave him the opportunity of setting on foot an extensive system of research in combination with his diligent personal observations. His appeal to the Russian government, in 1829, led to the establishment of a line of magnetic and meteorological stations across northern Asia. Meanwhile his letter to the Duke of Sussex, then (April 1836) president of the Royal Society, secured for the undertaking, the wide basis of the British dominions.The Encyclopdia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, observes, "Thus that scientific conspiracy of nations which is one of the noblest fruits of modern civilization was by his exertions first successfully organized." However, earlier examples of international scientific cooperation exist, notably the 18th-century observations of the transits of Venus.Then President of Mexico, Benito Jurez, gave him honorary Mexican citizenship.In 1811, and again in 1818, projects of Asiatic exploration were proposed to Humboldt, first by the Russian government, and afterwards by the Prussian government; but on each occasion, untoward circumstances interposed, and it was not until he had begun his sixtieth year that he resumed his early role of traveller in the interests of science. Between May and November 1829, he, together with his chosen associates, Gustav Rose and C. G. Ehrenberg, traversed the wide expanse of the Russian empire from the Neva to the Yenesei, accomplishing in twenty-five weeks a distance of 9,614 miles (15,472km). The journey, however, though carried out with all the advantages afforded by the immediate patronage of the Russian government, was too rapid to be profitable. The correction of the prevalent exaggerated estimate of the height of the Central Asian plateau, and the discovery of diamonds in the gold-washings of the Ural, a result which Humboldt's Brazilian experiences enabled him to predict, and by predicting to secure.Between 1830 and 1848 von Humboldt was frequently employed in diplomatic missions to the court of Louis Philippe, with whom he always maintained the most cordial personal relations.His brother, Wilhelm von Humboldt, died in Alexander's arms on April 8, 1836. The death saddened the later years of his life; Alexander lamented that he had lost half of himself with the death of his brother.Upon the accession of the crown prince Frederick William IV in June 1840, Humboldt's favour at court increased. Indeed, the new king's craving for Humboldt's company became at times so importunate as to leave him only a few waking hours to work on his writing.The first two volumes of the Kosmos were published between the years 1845 and 1847. Humboldt had long intended to write a comprehensive work about geography and the natural sciences. The writing took shape in lectures he delivered before the University of Berlin in the winter of 1827-28. These lectures would form "the cartoon for the great fresco of the [K]osmos".[14] The work attempted to unify the sciences then known in a Kantian framework. With inspiration from German Romanticism, Humboldt sought to create a compendium of the world's environment.He spent the last decade of his long life  as he called them, his "improbable" years  continuing this work. The third and fourth volumes were published in 1850-58; a fragment of a fifth appeared posthumously in 1862.Kosmos was very popular in Britain and America. In 1849 a German newspaper commented that in England two of the three different translations were made by women, "while in Germany most of the men do not understand it."[15] The first translation by Augustin Pritchard  published anonymously by Mr. Baillire (volume I in 1845 and volume II in 1848)  suffered from being hurriedly made. In a letter Humboldt said of it: "It will damage my reputation. All the charm of my description is destroyed by an English sounding like Sanskrit."The other two translations were made by Mrs. Sabine under the superintendence of her husband Col. Edward Sabine (4 volumes 18461858), and by Miss E.C. Ott (5 volumes 18491858, the only complete translation of the 4 German volumes). These three translations were also published in America. The numbering of the volumes differs between the German and the English editions. Volume 3 of the German edition corresponds to the volumes 3 and 4 of the English translation, as the German volume appeared in 2 parts in 1850 and 1851. Volume 5 of the German edition was not translated until 1981, again by a woman.[16] Miss Ott's translation benefited from a detailed table of contents, and an index for every volume; of the German edition only volumes 4 and 5 had a (extremely short) tables of contents, and the index to the whole work only appeared with volume 5 in 1862.Not so well known in Germany is the atlas belonging to the German edition of the Cosmos "Berghaus Physikalischer Atlas", better known as the pirated version by Traugott Bromme under the title "Atlas zu Alexander von Humboldt's Kosmos" (Stuttgart 1861). In Britain Heinrich Berghaus planned to publish together with Alexander Keith Johnston a "Physical Atlas". But later Johnston published it alone under the title "The Physical Atlas of Natural Phenomena". In Britain its connection to the Cosmos seems not have been recognized.[17]On February 24, 1857, Humboldt suffered a minor stroke, which passed without perceptible symptoms. It was not until the winter of 1858-1859 that his strength began to decline, and that spring, on May 6, he died quietly in Berlin at the age of 89. The honours which had been showered on him during life continued after his death. His remains, prior to being interred in the family resting-place at Tegel, were conveyed in state through the streets of Berlin, and received by the prince-regent at the door of the cathedral. The first centenary of his birth was celebrated on September 14, 1869, with great enthusiasm in both the New and Old Worlds. Numerous monuments were constructed in his honour, and newly explored regions named after Humboldt, bear witness to his wide fame and popularity.Much of Humboldt's private life remains a mystery because he destroyed his private letters.In 1908 the sexual researcher Paul Ncke, who worked with outspoken gay activist Magnus Hirschfeld, gathered reminiscences of him from people who recalled his participation in the homosexual subculture of Berlin.[18] A travelling companion, the pious Francisco Jos de Caldas, accused him of frequenting houses where 'impure love reigned', of making friends with 'obscene dissolute youths', and giving vent to 'shameful passions of his heart'.[19] But author Robert F. Aldrich concludes hesitantly: "As for so many men of his age, a definite answer is impossible."[20]Throughout his life Humboldt formed strong emotional attachments to men.[citation needed] In a letter to Reinhard von Haeften, a soldier, he wrote: "I know that I live only through you, my good precious Reinhard, and that I can only be happy in your presence."[21] He never married, yet there were at least two notable occasions where he seemed to have been drawn to the opposite sex. The first was an adolescent infatuation with Henriette Herz, the beautiful wife of Marcus Herz, his mentor, and the second was a short lived but intimate relationship with a woman named Pauline Wiesel in 1808 Paris.[22] He was strongly attached to his brother's family. Four years before his death, he executed a deed of gift transferring the absolute possession of his entire property to an old family servant named Seifert.[citation needed]Humboldt made many friends and had a reputation for widespread benevolence.[citation needed] He showed zeal for the improvement of the condition of the miners in Galicia and Franconia, detestation of slavery,[23] and patronage of rising men of science.[citation needed]As a consequence of his explorations, von Humboldt described many geographical features and species of life that were hitherto unknown to Europeans. Species named after him include:Features named after him include the following:The following places are named for Humboldt:The Mare Humboldtianum lunar mare is named after him, as is the asteroid 54 Alexandra.Alexander Von Humboldt also lends his name to a prominent lecture series in Human geography in the Netherlands (hosted by the Radboud University Nijmegen). It is the Dutch equivalent of the widely known annual Hettner lectures at the University of Heidelberg.After his death, his friends and colleagues created the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Stiftung in German) to continue von Humboldt's generous support of young scientists. Although the original endowment was lost in the German hyperinflation of the 1920s, and again as a result of World War II, the Foundation has been re-endowed by the German government to award young scientists and distinguished senior scientists from abroad. It plays an important role in attracting foreign researchers to work in Germany and enabling German researchers to work abroad for a periodEdgar Allan Poe dedicated his last major work, Eureka: A Prose Poem, to von Humboldt. Humboldt's attempt to unify the sciences in his Kosmos was a big inspiration for Poe's project.Charles Darwin made frequent reference to Humboldt's work in his Voyage of the Beagle, where Darwin described his own scientific exploration of the Americas. In one note, he placed Humboldt first on the "list of American travellers".[26] When this Journal was published, Darwin sent a copy to Humboldt, who responded "You told me in your kind letter that, when you were young, the manner in which I studied and depicted nature in the torrid zones contributed toward exciting in you the ardour and desire to travel in distant lands. Considering the importance of your work, Sir, this may be the greatest success that my humble work could bring."[27] In his autobiography, Darwin recalled reading "with care and profound interest Humboldt's Personal Narrative" and finding it one of the two most influential books on his work, which had "stirred up in me a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the noble structure of Natural Science."[28]Alexander von Humboldt is also a German ship named after the scientist originally built in 1906 by the German shipyard AG Weser at Bremen as Reserve Sonderburg. She was operated throughout the North and Baltic Seas until being retired in 1986. Subsequently she was converted into a three masted barque by the German shipyard Motorwerke Bremerhaven and was re-launched in 1988 as Alexander von Humboldt.Wilhelm von Humboldt: "Alexander is destined to combine ideas and follow chains of thoughts which would otherwise have remained unknown for ages. His depth, his sharp mind and his incredible speed are a rare combination."[citation needed]Charles Darwin: expressed his debt to Humboldt, and admiration for his work,[29] and wrote to Joseph Dalton Hooker that Humboldt was the "greatest scientific traveller who ever lived".[30]Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: "Humboldt showers us with true treasures."[citation needed]Friedrich von Schiller: "Alexander impresses many, particularly when compared to his brother - because he shows off more!"[citation needed]Simn Bolvar: "Alexander von Humboldt has done more for America than all its conquerors, he is the true discoverer of America."[citation needed]Jos de la Luz y Caballero: "Columbus gave Europe a New World; Humboldt made it known in its physical, material, intellectual, and moral aspects."[citation needed]Napolon Bonaparte: "You have been studying Botanics? Just like my wife!"[citation needed]Claude Louis Berthollet: "This man is as knowledgeable as a whole academy."[citation needed]Thomas Jefferson: "I consider him the most important scientist whom I have met."[citation needed]Emil Du Bois-Reymond: "Every scientist is a descendant of Humboldt. We are all his family."[citation needed]Robert G. Ingersoll: "He was to science what Shakespeare was to the drama."[citation needed]Hermann von Helmholtz: "During the first half of the present century we had an Alexander von Humboldt, who was able to scan the scientific knowledge of his time in its details, and to bring it within one vast generalization. At the present juncture, it is obviously very doubtful whether this task could be accomplished in a similar way, even by a mind with gifts so peculiarly suited for the purpose as Humboldt's was, and if all his time and work were devoted to the purpose." [31]Le voyage aux rgions equinoxiales du Nouveau Continent, fait en 1799-1804, par Alexandre de Humboldt et Aim Bonpland (Paris, 1807, etc.), consisted of thirty folio and quarto volumes, and comprised a considerable number of subordinate but important works. Among these may be enumeratedThe Nova genera et species plantarum (7 vols. folio, 18151825), containing descriptions of above 4500 species of plants collected by Humboldt and Bonpland, was mainly compiled by Carl Sigismund Kunth; J. Oltmanns assisted in preparing the Recueil d'observations astronomiques (1808); Cuvier, Latreille, Valenciennes and Gay-Lussac cooperated in the Recueil d'observations de zoologie et d'anatomie compare (18051833).Humboldt's Ansichten der Natur (Stuttgart and Tbingen, 1808) went through three editions in his lifetime, and was translated into nearly every European language.The results of his Asiatic journey were published in Fragments de gologie et de climatologie asiatiques (2 vols. 8vo, 1831), and in Asie centrale (3 vols. 8vo, 1843) an enlargement of the earlier work. The memoirs and papers read by him before scientific societies, or contributed by him to scientific periodicals, are too numerous for specification.A 1992 essay entitled "Journey to the Top of the World" details Humboldt's South American exploration and America's interest in him. The essay is chapter one of David McCullough's book, Brave Companions: Portraits in History (Prentice Hall Press, 1992).Gerard Helferich's 2004 biography Humboldt's Cosmos: Alexander von Humboldt and the Latin American Journey that Changed the World (Gotham Books, 2004) provides a descriptive account of Humboldt's journey through Latin America, it utilizes Humboldt's journals.Daniel Kehlmann's 2005 novel Die Vermessung der Welt, translated into English by Carol Brown Janeway as Measuring the World in 2006, explores Humboldt's life through a lens of historical fiction, contrasting his character and contributions to science to those of Carl Friedrich Gauss.Humboldt's effect on American scientists and environmentalists (Clarence King, Jeremiah N. Reynolds, George Wallace Melville, and John Muir) is examined in The Humboldt Current: Nineteenth Century Exploration and the Roots of American Environmentalism, by Aaron Sachs (Viking, 2006).PortalSourcesMisc1 Biography

Vermont (pronounced/vrmnt/( listen)[5], /vrmnt/, /vrmn()/ or /vrmn()/[6]) is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Vermont is the 6th least extensive and the 2nd least populous of the 50 United States. It is the only New England state not bordering the Atlantic Ocean. Lake Champlain forms half of Vermont's western border, which it shares with the state of New York. The Green Mountains are within the state. Vermont is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, New York to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north.Originally inhabited by two major Native American tribes (the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and the Iroquois), much of the territory that is now Vermont was claimed by France during its early colonial period. France ceded the territory to the Kingdom of Great Britain after being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years' War (also called the French and Indian War). For many years, the nearby colonies, especially New Hampshire and New York, disputed control of the area (then called the New Hampshire Grants). Settlers who held land titles granted by these colonies were opposed by the Green Mountain Boys militia, which eventually prevailed in creating an independent state, the Vermont Republic. Founded in 1777 during the Revolutionary War, the republic lasted for fourteen years. Setting aside the Thirteen Colonies, Vermont is one of only four U.S. states (along with Texas, Hawaii, and the briefly declared Republic of West Florida) to have been a sovereign state in its past. In 1791, Vermont joined the United States as the 14th state, the first outside the original 13 Colonies. It abolished slavery while still independent, and upon joining the Union became the first state to have done so.Vermont is the leading producer of maple syrup in the United States.[7] The state capital is Montpelier, which has a population of 7,855 and is the least populated state capital in the country.[8] Vermont's most populous city is Burlington, with a 2010 population of 42,417,[9] which makes it the least populous "largest city of a state" in the United States. Burlington's metropolitan area is 211,261.[10]Vermont is located in the New England region in the eastern United States and comprises 9,614 square miles (24,900km2), making it the 45th-largest state. It is the only state that doesn't have any buildings taller than 150 feet (46m).[citation needed] Land comprises 9,250 square miles (24,000km2) and water comprises 365 square miles (950km2), making it the 43rd-largest in land area and the 47th in water area. In total area, it is larger than El Salvador and smaller than Haiti.The west bank of the Connecticut River marks the eastern (New Hampshire) border of the state (the river is part of New Hampshire).[11] Lake Champlain, the major lake in Vermont, is the sixth-largest body of fresh water in the United States and separates Vermont from New York in the northwest portion of the state. From north to south, Vermont is 159 miles (256km) long. Its greatest width, from east to west, is 89 miles (143km) at the Canadian border; the narrowest width is 37 miles (60km) at the Massachusetts line. The width averages 60.5 miles (97.4km). The state's geographic center is Washington, three miles (5km) east of Roxbury. There are fifteen US federal border crossings between Vermont and Canada.The origin of the name "Vermont" is uncertain, but likely comes from the French les Verts Monts, meaning "the Green Mountains".[12] Thomas Young introduced it in 1777.[13] Some authorities[specify] say that the mountains were called green because they were more forested than the higher White Mountains of New Hampshire and Adirondacks of New York; others say that the predominance of mica-quartz-chlorite schist, a green-hued metamorphosed shale, is the reason. The Green Mountain range forms a northsouth spine running most of the length of the state, slightly west of its center. In the southwest portion of the state are the Taconic Mountains; the Granitic Mountains are in the northeast.[14] In the northwest, near Lake Champlain, is the fertile Champlain Valley. In the south of the valley is Lake Bomoseen.Several mountains have timberlines with delicate year-round alpine ecosystems, including Mount Mansfield, the highest mountain in the state; Killington Peak, the second-highest; Camel's Hump, the state's third-highest; and Mount Abraham, the fifth-highest peak. About 77% of the state is covered by forest;[citation needed] the rest is covered in meadow, uplands, lakes, ponds, and swampy wetlands.Areas in Vermont administered by the National Park Service include the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park (in Woodstock) and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail.[15]Vermont has nine incorporated cities, listed by population.Although these towns are large enough to be considered cities, they are not incorporated as such.The annual mean temperature for the state is 43 F (6C).[16] Vermont has a humid continental climate, with muddy springs, a generally mild early summer, hot Augusts;[citation needed] it has colorful autumns: Vermont's hills reveal red, orange, and (on sugar maples) gold foliage as cold weather approaches. Winters are colder at higher elevations.[17] It has a Kppen climate classification of Dfb, similar to Minsk, Stockholm, and Fargo.[18]The rural northeastern section (dubbed the "Northeast Kingdom") often averages 10F (5.56C) colder than the southern areas of the state during winter. The annual snowfall averages between 60 to 100 inches (1,500 to 2,500 mm) depending on elevation.Vermont is the seventh coldest state in the country.[19] In winter, until typical El Nino conditions, Vermont's winters are "too cold to snow"; the air is too cold to contain sufficient moisture to prompt precipitation.[20]The highest recorded temperature was 105 F (41C), at Vernon, on July 4, 1911; the lowest recorded temperature was 50 F (46C), at Bloomfield, on December 30, 1933; this is the lowest temperature recorded in New England (Big Black River, Maine, also recorded a verified 50 F (46C) in 2009).[21][22] The agricultural growing season ranges from 120 to 180 days.[23]The USDA Plant hardiness zones for the state range between zone 3b (no colder than 35 F (37C) ) in the Northeast Kingdom and northern part of the state, to zone 5b (no colder than 15 F (26C) ) in the southern part of the state.[24]The state receives between 2,000 and 2,400 hours of sunshine annually.[25]There are five distinct physiographic regions of Vermont. Categorized by geological and physical attributes, they are the Northeastern Highlands, the Green Mountains, the Taconic Mountains, the Champlain Lowlands, and the Vermont Piedmont.[27]About 500 million years ago Vermont was part of Laurentia and located in the tropics.[28]The central and southern Green Mountain range include the oldest rocks in Vermont, formed about one billion years ago during the first mountain building period (or orogeny). Subsequently, about 400 million years ago, the second mountain building period created Green Mountain peaks that were 15,00020,000 feet (4,6006,100 m) tall, three to four times their current height and comparable to the Himalayas. The geological pressures that created those peaks remain evident as the Champlain Thrust, running northsouth to the west of the mountains (now the eastern shore of Lake Champlain). It is an example of geological fault thrusting where bedrock is pushed over the newer rock formation.As a result of tectonic formation, Vermont east of the Green Mountains tends to be formed from rocks produced in the Silurian and Devonian periods. Western Vermont mainly from the older Pre-Cambrian and Cambrian material.[29]Several large deposits within the state contain granite. The Rock of Ages Quarry in Barre is one of the leading exporters of granite in the country. The work of the trained sculptors of this corporation can be seen 3 miles (4.8km) down the road at the Hope Cemetery, where gravestones and mausoleums can be seen.Some buildings in Germany, Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi are constructed almost primarily[clarification needed] of Vermont granite. Rock of Ages quarries two kinds of granite in Vermont: Barre Gray and Bethel White.[30][31]The remains of the Chazy Formation can be observed in Isle La Motte. It was one of the first tropical reefs. It is the site of the limestone Fisk Quarry, which contains a collection of ancient marine fossils such as stromatoporoids. These fossils date back to 200 million years ago.[clarification needed] It is believed that at one point, Vermont was connected to Africa (Pangaea) and the fossils found and the rock formations found on the coasts in both Africa and America are further evidence of the Pangaea theory.[32][33][34]In the past four centuries, Vermont has experienced a few earthquakes rarely centered under Vermont, the highest being a Richter magnitude scale 6.0 in 1952.[35]The state contains 41 species of reptiles and amphibians, 89 species of fish, of which 12 are non-native;[36] 193 species of breeding birds, 58 species of mammals, more than 15,000 insect species, and 2,000 higher plant species, plus fungi, algae, and 75 different types of natural communities.[37]Vermont contains one species of venomous snake, the Eastern timber rattlesnake, which is confined to a few acres in western Rutland County.[38]By the mid-19th century, wild turkeys were exterminated in the state through overhunting and destruction of habitat. Sixteen were re-introduced in 1969 and had grown to an estimated flock of 45,000 in 2009.[39]Since 1970, reduction of farmland has resulted in reduced environment for, and reduced numbers of various shrubland birds including the American woodcock, brown thrasher, Eastern towhee, willow flycatcher, golden-winged warbler, blue-winged warbler, field sparrow, and Baltimore oriole.[40]DDT destroyed the eggshells of ospreys which resulted in their disappearance from the state. This species began reviving in 1998. As of 2010, they were no longer endangered in the state.[41]White-nose syndrome killed an estimated two-thirds of all cave-wintering bats in the state from 2008 to 2010.[42]The New England cottontail disappeared from the state in the early 1970s, out-competed by the eastern cottontail rabbit, imported in the 1800s for hunting, and which is better able to detect predators.[43]Vermont is in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome. Much of the state, in particular the Green Mountains, is covered by the conifers and northern hardwoods of the New England-Acadian forests. The western border with New York and the area around Lake Champlain lies within the Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests. The southwest corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River are covered by Northeastern coastal forests of mixed oak.[44]Invasive wild honeysuckle has been deemed a threat to the state's forests, native species of plants, and wildlife.[45]Many of Vermont's rivers, including the Winooski River, have been subjected to man-made barriers to prevent flooding.Climate change appears to be affecting the maple sugar industry. Sugar maples have been subject to stress by acid rain, asian longhorn beetles, pear thrips, and, in 2011, an excessive deer herd which is forced to eat bark in the winter. These maples need a certain amount of cold to produce sap for maple syrup. The time to tap these trees has shrunk to one week in some years. The tree may be replaced by the more aggressive Norway maples, effectively forcing the sugar maples to "migrate" north to Canada.[46]Between 8500 to 7000 BCE, at the time of the Champlain Sea, Native Americans inhabited and hunted in Vermont. During the Archaic period, from the 8th millenniumBCE to 1000BCE, Native Americans migrated year-round. During the Woodland period, from 1000BCE to CE1600, villages and trade networks were established, and ceramic and bow and arrow technology was developed. In the western part of the state there lived a small population of Algonquian-speaking tribes, including the Mohican and Abenaki peoples. Sometime between 1500 and 1600, the Iroquois drove many of the smaller native tribes out of Vermont, later using the area as a hunting ground and warring with the remaining Abenaki. The population in 1500 was estimated to be around 10,000 people.The first European to see Vermont is thought to have been Jacques Cartier in 1535. On July 30, 1609 French explorer Samuel de Champlain claimed Vermont as part of New France, and erected Fort Lamotte in 1666 which was the first European settlement in Vermont.In 1638, a "violent" earthquake was felt throughout New England, centered in the St. Lawrence Valley. This was the first seismic event noted in Vermont.[35]In 1690, a group of Dutch-British settlers from Albany established a settlement and trading post at Chimney Point 8 miles (13km) west of present-day Addison.During Dummer's War, the first permanent British settlement was established in 1724, with the construction of Fort Dummer protecting the nearby settlements of Dummerston and Brattleboro.From 1731 to 1734, the French constructed Fort St. Frdric which gave the French control of the New France/Vermont frontier region in the Lake Champlain Valley. With the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754, the French began construction of Fort Carillon at present-day Ticonderoga, New York in 1755. The British failed to take Fort St. Frdric or Fort Carillon between 1755 and 1758. In 1759, a combined force of 12,000 British regular and provincial troops under Sir Jeffery Amherst captured Carillon, after which the French abandoned Fort St. Frdric. Amherst then constructed Fort Crown Point next to the remains of the Fort St. Frdric, securing British control over the area.Following France's loss in the French and Indian War, the 1763 Treaty of Paris gave control of the land to the British. Colonial settlement was limited by the crown to lands east of the Appalachians, and Vermont was divided nearly in half in a jagged line running from Fort William Henry in Lake George diagonally north-eastward to Lake Memphremagog.[citation needed] The end of the war brought new settlers to Vermont. Ultimately, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York all claimed this frontier area.On March 20, 1764, King GeorgeIII established the boundary between New Hampshire and New York along the west bank of the Connecticut River, north of Massachusetts, and south of 45 degrees north latitude. When New York refused to recognize land titles known as the New Hampshire Grants (towns created by land grants sold by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth), dissatisfied colonists organized in opposition, which led to the creation of independent Vermont on January 15, 1777.[47][48] In 1770, Ethan Allen, his brothers Ira and Levi, and Seth Warner recruited an informal militia, known as the Green Mountain Boys, to protect the interests of the original New Hampshire settlers against the new migrants from New York.On January 15, 1777, representatives of the New Hampshire Grants declared the independence of Vermont.[49] For the first six months of its existence, it was called The Republic of New Connecticut.[50]On June 2, 1777, a second convention of 72 delegates met to adopt the name "Vermont." This was on the advice of a friendly Pennsylvanian who wrote to them on how to achieve admission into the newly independent United States as the 14th state.[50] On July 4, the Constitution of Vermont was drafted at the Windsor Tavern; it was adopted by the delegates on July 8. This was among the first written constitutions in North America and was indisputably the first to abolish the institution of slavery, provide for universal adult male suffrage, and require support of public schools. It was in effect from 1777 to 1791.[51] Slavery was banned again by state law on November 25, 1858.[52]The Battle of Bennington, fought on August 16, 1777, was a seminal event in the history of the state of Vermont.A combined American force, under General Stark's command, attacked the British column at Hoosick, New York, just across the border from Bennington and killed or captured virtually the entire British detachment. General Burgoyne never recovered from this loss and eventually surrendered the remainder of his 6,000-man force at Saratoga, New York, on October 17.The Battles of Bennington and Saratoga are recognized as the turning point in the Revolutionary War because they were the first major defeat of a British army. The anniversary of the battle is still celebrated in Vermont as a legal holiday.The Battle of Hubbardton (July 7, 1777) was the only battle in present day Vermont and though the Continental forces were technically defeated, the British forces were damaged to the point that they did not pursue the Americans (retreating from Fort Ticonderoga) any further.Vermont continued to govern itself as a sovereign entity based in the eastern town of Windsor for fourteen years. The independent state of Vermont issued its own coinage from 1785 to 1788[53] and operated a statewide postal service. Thomas Chittenden was the Governor in 17781789 and in 17901791. The state was obliged to solve conflicting property ownership disputes with New Yorkers. On March 4, 1791, Vermont joined the federal union as the fourteenth state, and the first to enter the Union after the original thirteen colonies.Vermont had a unicameral legislature until 1836.The mid-1850s onwards saw a transition from Vermonters mostly favoring slavery's containment, to a far more serious opposition to the institution, producing the Radical Republican and abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens. While the Whig Party shriveled, and the Republican Party emerged, Vermont strongly trended in support of its candidates. In 1860 it voted for President Abraham Lincoln, giving him the largest margin of victory of any state.During the American Civil War, Vermont sent more than 34,000 men into United States service. Almost 5,200 Vermonters, 15 percent, were killed or mortally wounded in action or died of disease, a higher percentage than any other state.The northernmost land action of the war, the St. Albans Raid, took place in Vermont.The first election in which women were allowed to vote was on December 18, 1880, when women were granted limited suffrage and were first allowed to vote in town elections, and then in state legislative races.Large-scale flooding occurred in early November 1927. During this incident, 84 people died including the state's lieutenant-governor.[54]The 1938 New England hurricane blew down 15,000,000 acres (61,000km2) of trees, one-third of the total forest at the time in New England. 3 billion board feet were salvaged. Many of the older trees in the state are about 75 years old, dating from after this storm.[55]Another flood occurred in 1973, causing the death of two people and millions of dollars in property damage.In 1964, the US Supreme Court decision in Reynolds v. Sims that forced "one-man, one-vote" redistricting on all states required large changes in Vermont, giving cities an equitable share of votes in both houses for the entire country.[56] Until that time, counties had often been represented by area in state senates and were often unsympathetic to possible solutions to urban problems that would increase taxes.[citation needed]The governor called the 2011 flooding caused by Tropical Storm Irene one of the worst in the 20th and 21st century, second only to the flood of 1927.[57] Vermont was the first state to introduce civil unions in July 2000, and in 2009 Vermont became the first state to introduce same-sex marriage by enacting a statute without being required to do so by a court decision.[58]The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Vermont was 626,431 on July 1, 2011, a 0.11% increase since the 2010 United States Census.[1] The center of population of Vermont is located in Washington County, in the town of Warren.[59]According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2005, Vermont has an estimated population of 623,050, which is an increase of 1,817, or 0.3 percent, from the prior year and an increase of 14,223, or 2.3 percent, since 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 7,148 people (33,606 births minus 26,458 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 7,889 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 4,359 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 3,530 people. As of 2009, 47.8% of Vermont's population was born outside the state, with first and second-generation Vermonters representing a majority of the population.[60]Vermont is the least populous state in New England. In 2006 it had the second lowest birthrate in the nation, 42/1000 women.[61] The median age of the work force was 42.3, the highest in the nation.In 2009, 12.6 percent of people over 15 were divorced. This was the fifth highest percentage in the nation.[62]Vermont's population is:[63]Among the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Vermont ranks:The above percentages are from the 2010 Census.The largest ancestry groups are:[65]Residents of British ancestry (especially English) live throughout most of Vermont. The northern part of the state maintains a significant percentage of people of French-Canadian ancestry. Some vestiges of a Vermont accent are heard but the population has become more homogenized around American standard English in recent years.According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 2.54 percent of the population aged five and older speak French at home, while 1 percent speak Spanish.[66]As of 2012 Vermont is considered the least religious state in the U.S., with 23% of the residents considering themselves "very religious".[69] In 2008 over half of Vermont residents identified themselves as Christians. The largest single religious body in the state is the Roman Catholic Church. According to the ARDA in 2000, the Catholic Church had 147,918 members.Almost one-third of Vermonters were self-identified Protestants. The Congregational United Church of Christ is the largest Protestant denomination (21,597) and Vermont has the largest percentage of this denomination of any state.[70] The number of congregations of the United Church of Christ (149) was larger than the number of Catholic congregations (133).[71]The second largest Protestant denomination is the United Methodist Church with 19,000 members;[71] followed by Episcopalians, "other" Christians, and Baptists.Twenty-four percent of Vermonters attended church regularly. This low is matched nationally only by New Hampshire.[72]In 2008, 34 percent of Vermonters claimed no religion; this is the highest percentage in the nation.[73][74] A survey suggested that people in Vermont and New Hampshire which were polled jointly, were less likely to attend weekly services and are less likely to believe in God (54 percent) than people in the rest of the nation (71 percent). The two states were at the lowest levels among states in religious commitment. About 23 percent of the respondents attended religious service at least once a week (39 percent nationally). Thirty-six percent said religion is very important to them (56 percent nationally).[75]Joseph Smith, Jr. and Brigham Youngthe first two leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintswere both born in Vermont. A memorial to Joseph Smith, at his birthplace in Sharon, is maintained by the LDS church and draws about 70,000 visitors annually. As of 2010 the church reports 4,386 members in twelve congregations throughout the state.[76]Vermont may have the highest concentration of western-convert Buddhists in the country. Several Buddhist retreat centers are located in the state.[77]2,000 people of Islamic faith are estimated to live in the state.[78]In 2007, Vermont was ranked by Forbes magazine as 32nd among states in which to do business. It was 30th the previous year.[79] In 2008, an economist said that the state had "a really stagnant economy, which is what we are forecasting for Vermont for the next 30 years."[80] In May 2010, Vermont's 6.2 percent unemployment rate was the fourth lowest in the nation.[81] This rate reflects the second sharpest decline among the 50 states since the prior May.[82]According to the 2010 U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis report, Vermont's gross state product (GSP) was $26 billion.[83] Not accounting for size, this places the state 50th among the 50 states. It stood 34th in per capita GSP.[84][85]Components of GSP were:[86][87]Canada was Vermont's largest foreign trade partner in 2007. The state's second largest foreign trade partner was Taiwan.[88] The state had $4 billion worth of commerce with Qubec.[89]One measure of economic activity is retail sales. The state had $5.2 billion in 2007.[90] In 2008, 8,631 new businesses were registered in Vermont, a decline of 500 from 2007.[91]The median household income from 2002 to 2004 was $45,692. This was 15th nationally.[92] The median wage in the state in 2008 was $15.31 hourly or $31,845 annually.[93] About 80 percent of the 68,000 Vermonters who qualify for food stamps, actually received them in 2007.[94] 40 percent of seniors 75 years or older live on annual incomes of $21,660 or less.[95]Agriculture contributes $2.6 billion,[96] about 12%, directly and indirectly to the state's economy.[97] However, another study claims that agriculture contributed 2.2% of the state's domestic product in 2000.[98] In 2000, about 3 percent of the state's working population engaged in agriculture.[99]Over the past two centuries, logging has fallen off as over-cutting and the exploitation of other forests made Vermont's forest less attractive. The decline of farms has resulted in a regrowth of Vermont's forests due to ecological succession. Today, most of Vermont's forests are secondary. The state and non-profit organizations are actively encouraging regrowth and careful forest management. Over 78 percent of the land area of the state is forested. Over 85 percent of that area is non-industrial, private forestland owned by individuals or families.Dairy farming is the primary source of agricultural income. In the last half of the 20th century, developers had plans to build condos and houses on what was relatively inexpensive, open land. Vermont's government responded with a series of laws controlling development and with some pioneering initiatives to prevent the loss of Vermont's dairy industry. Still, the number of Vermont dairy farms has declined more than 85 percent from the 11,206 dairy farms operating in 1947. In 2003 there were fewer than 1,500 dairy farms in the state; in 2006 there were 1,138; and in 2007 there were 1,087. The number of dairy farms has been diminishing by 10 percent annually.[100]The number of cattle in Vermont had declined by 40 percent; however, milk production has doubled in the same period due to tripling the production per cow.[101] While milk production rose, Vermont's market share declined. Within a group of states supplying the Boston and New York City markets,[102] Vermont was third in market share, with 10.6 percent; New York has 44.9 percent and Pennsylvania has 32.9 percent.[103] In 2007, dairy farmers received a record $23.60 for 100 pounds (45kg) of milk. This dropped in 2008 to $17.[104] The average dairy farm produced 1.3 million pounds of milk annually in 2008.[105]The dairy barn remains an iconic image of Vermont, but the 87 percent decrease in active dairy farms between 1947 and 2003[106] preservation of the dairy barns has increasingly become dependent upon a commitment to maintaining a legacy rather than basic need in the agricultural economy. The Vermont Barn Census, organized by a collaboration of educational and nonprofit state and local historic preservation programs, has developed educational and administrative systems for recording the number, condition, and features of barns throughout Vermont.[107]In 2009, there were 543 organic farms. Twenty percent of the dairy farms were organic and 23 percent (128) vegetable farms were organic. Organic farming increased in 200607, but leveled off in 200809. Nor are any expected for 2010.[108]A significant amount of milk is shipped into the Boston market. Therefore the Commonwealth of Massachusetts certifies that Vermont farms meet Massachusetts sanitary standards. Without this certification, a farmer may not sell milk for distribution into the bulk market.[109]An important and growing part of Vermont's economy is the manufacture and sale of artisan foods, fancy foods, and novelty items trading in part upon the Vermont "brand" which the state manages and defends. Examples of these specialty exports include Cabot Cheese, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company, Fine Paints of Europe, Vermont Butter and Cheese Company, several micro breweries, ginseng growers, Burton Snowboards, Lake Champlain Chocolates, King Arthur Flour, and Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream.There were about 2,000 maple products producers in 2010.[110] In 2001, Vermont produced 275,000 US gallons (1,040,000 L) of maple syrup, about one-quarter of U.S. production. For 2005 that number was 410,000 US gallons (1,600,000l; 340,000impgal) accounting for 37 percent of national production.[111] This rose to 920,000 US gallons (3,500,000l; 770,000impgal) in 2009.[112]Wine industry in Vermont started in 1985. There are 14 wineries today.[113]Farms in the state were estimated to have hired 2,000 illegal immigrants as of 2005. Local authorities have ignored the problem, sympathizing with the employers about being able to efficiently run a farm.[114]Vermont's largest for-profit employer, IBM, in Essex Junction, provides 25 percent of all manufacturing jobs in Vermont, employing 6,800 workers in 2007.[115] It is responsible for $1 billion of the state's annual economy.[116]A 2010 University of Connecticut study reported that Vermont, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire tied as the most costly states in the U.S. for manufacturers.[117]An increasingly aging population is expected to improve this industry's position in the state economy. In 2008, Fletcher Allen Health Care was the second largest employer of people in the state.[118]In 2010, all of Vermont's hospitals billed patients $3.76 billion, and collected $2 billion.[119]In 2007 Vermont was the 17th highest state in the nation for mortgage affordability. However, in 41 other states, inhabitants contributed within plus or minus 4 percent of Vermont's 18.4 percent of household income to a mortgage.[120]Housing prices did not rise much during the early 2000s. As a result, the collapse in real estate values was not that precipitous either. While foreclosure rose significantly in 2007, the state stood 50th (last, and best) in ratio of foreclosure filings to households.[121] While housing sales dropped annually from 2004 to 2008, prices continued to rise.[122]In 2007, Vermont was best in the country for construction of new energy efficient homes as evaluated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the Energy Star program.[123] However, about 60 percent of Vermont homes were heated with oil in 2008.[124] In August 2008, the cost in Vermont of various heating sources per 1 million BTU ranged from $14.39 for cord wood to $43.50 for kerosene.While the number of houses sold in the state has dropped from 8,318 in 2004 to 8,120 in 2005, 6,919 in 2006, and 5,820 in 2007, the average price has continued to rise to $202,500 in 2008 ($200,000 in 2007).[125]In 2009, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment was $920 per month. Rental vacancy was 5.4 percent, the lowest in the nation. 2,800 people were counted as homeless in January 2010, 22 percent more than in 2008.[126]In 2011, Vermont was fifth among the states with the greatest backlog of foreclosures needing court processing, taking an estimated 18 years. The national average was eight years.[127]As of 2006, there were 305,000 workers in Vermont. 11 percent of these are unionized.[128][129] Out of a workforce of 299,200 workers, 52,000 were government jobs, federal, state and local. [130]A modern high unemployment rate of 9 percent was reached in June 1976. A modern low of 2.4 percent was measured in February 2000.[131] As of September 2010, the unemployment rate was 5.8 percent.[132]Employment grew 7.5 percent from 2000 to 2006. From 1980 to 2000, employment grew by 3.4 percent; nationally it was up 4.6 percent. Real wages were $33,385 in 2006 constant dollars and remained there in 2010; the nation, $36,871.[133]Captive insurance plays an increasingly large role in Vermont's economy. With this form of alternative insurance, large corporations or industry associations form standalone insurance companies to insure their own risks, thereby substantially reducing their insurance premiums and gaining a significant measure of control over types of risks to be covered. There are also significant tax advantages to be gained from the formation and operation of captive insurance companies. According to the Insurance Information Institute, Vermont in 2009 was the world's third-largest domicile for captive insurance companies, following Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.[134] In 2009, there were 560 such companies.[135] In 2010, the state had 900 such companies.[136]Tourism is an important industry to the state. Some of the largest ski areas in New England are located in Vermont. Skiers and snowboarders visit Burke Mountain Ski Area, Bolton Valley, Stowe, Smugglers' Notch, Killington Ski Resort, Mad River Glen, Sugarbush, Stratton, Jay Peak, Okemo, Suicide Six, Mount Snow, Bromley, and Magic Mountain Ski Area. Summer visitors tour resort towns like Stowe, Manchester, Quechee, Wilmington and Woodstock. Resorts, hotels, restaurants, and shops, designed to attract tourists, employ people year-round. Summer camps contribute to Vermont's tourist economy.Visitors participate in trout fishing, lake fishing, and ice fishing. Some hike the Long Trail.In winter, nordic and backcountry skiers visit to travel the length of the state on the Catamount Trail. Several horse shows are annual events. Vermont's state parks, historic sites, museums, golf courses, and new boutique hotels with spas were designed to attract tourists.According to the 2000 Census, almost 15 percent of all housing units in Vermont were vacant and classified "for seasonal, recreational, or occasional use".[137][clarification needed] This was the second highest percentage nationwide, after Maine. In some Vermont cities, vacation homes owned by wealthy residents of New England and New York City constitute the bulk of all housing stock. According to one estimate, as of 2009, 84 percent of all houses in Ludlow, Vermont, were owned by out-of-state residents.[138] Other notable vacation-home resorts include Manchester and Stowe.In 2005, visitors made an estimated 13.4 million trips to the state, spending $1.57 billion.[139]In 200001, there were 4,579,719 skier and snowboarder visits to the state. There were 4,125,082 visits in 20092010, a rise from recent years.[140]In 2008, there were 35,000 members of 138 snowmobiling clubs in Vermont. The combined association of clubs maintains 6,000 miles (9,700km) of trail often over private lands. The industry is said to generate "hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business."[141]Hunting is controlled for black bear, wild turkeys, deer, and moose.[142] There are 5,500 bears in the state. The goal is to keep the numbers between 4,500 and 6,000.[143] In 2010, there were about 141,000 deer in the state, which is in range of government goals. However, these are distributed unevenly and when in excess of 10-15 per square mile, negatively impact timber growth.[144]In 2012, hunting of migratory birds was limited to October 13 to December 16. Waterfowl hunting is also controlled by federal law.[145]The towns of Rutland and Barre are the traditional centers of marble and granite quarrying and carving in the U.S. For many years Vermont was also the headquarters of the smallest union in the U.S., the Stonecutters Association, of about 500 members. The first marble quarry in America was on Mount Aeolus overlooking East Dorset.[146] Up the western side of the state runs the "Marble Valley" joining up with the "Slate Valley" that runs from just inside New York across from Chimney Point until it meets the "Granite Valley" that runs west past Barre, where is located the Rock of Ages quarry, the largest granite quarry in America.Vermont is the largest producer of slate in the country.[147]Production of dimension stone is the greatest producer of revenues by quarrying.There were 2,682 non-profit organizations in Vermont in 2008, with $2.8 billion in revenue.[148] The state ranked ninth in the country for volunteerism for the period 200508. 35.6% of the population volunteered during this period. The national average was 26.4%.[149]Vermont's main mode of travel is by automobile. 5.7 percent of Vermont households did not own a car in 2008.[150] On average, 2025 people die each year from drunk driving incidents; as well as 7080 people in fatal car crashes in the state.[151] Motorists have the highest rate of insurance in the country, 93%, tied with Pennsylvania.[152]In 2010 Vermont owned 2,840 miles (4,570km) of highway. This was the third smallest quantity among the 50 states. 2.5 percent of the highways were listed as "congested," the 5th lowest in the country. The highway fatality rate was 1 per 100,000,000 miles (160,000,000km), tenth lowest in the nation. The highways cost $28,669 per 1 mile (1.6km) to maintain, the 17th highest in the states. 34.4 percent of its bridges were rated deficient or obsolete, the 8th worst in the nation.[153]Individual communities and counties have public transit, but their breadth of coverage is frequently limited. Greyhound Lines services a number of small towns. Two Amtrak trains serve Vermont, the Vermonter[154] and the Ethan Allen Express.[155] In 2011, Amtrak evaluated the track used by the Ethan Allen Express between Rutland and Whitehall, as the worst in the nation.[156]Trucks weighing less than 80,000 pounds (36,000kg) can use Vermont's interstate highways. The limit for state roads is 99,000 pounds (45,000kg). This means that vehicles too heavy for the turnpikes can legally only use secondary roads.[157][158]In 2011, the American Society for Public Administration rated Vermont among the top ten best states for overall litter/debris removals from public spaces/properties (roadways, streams, trails).[159][citation needed]The state has 2,843 miles (4,575km) of highways under its control.[160]For a more detailed explanation see a List of Routes in Vermont.A 200506 study ranked Vermont 37th out of the states for "cost-effective road maintenance", a decline of thirteen places since 200405.[161]Federal data indicates that 16 percent of Vermont's 2,691 bridges had been rated structurally deficient by the state in 2006.[162] In 2007 Vermont had the sixth worst percentage of structurally deficient bridges in the country.[163]The state is served by Amtrak's Vermonter and Ethan Allen Express, the New England Central Railroad, the Vermont Railway, and the Green Mountain Railroad.The Ethan Allen Express serves Rutland and Castleton,[155] while the Vermonter serves Saint Albans, Essex Junction, Waterbury, Montpelier, Randolph, White River Junction, Windsor, Bellows Falls and Brattleboro.[154]Greyhound Lines stops at Bellows Falls, Brattleboro, Burlington, Montpelier, and White River Junction. Other transportation includes:[164]Vermont is served by two commercial airports:Vermont statute[169] requires the Vermont secretary of state to designate newspapers that provide general coverage across the state as the "Newspapers of Record." On June 30, 2010, the secretary of state designated the following newspapers for publishing administrative rule notices during the period of July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011:[170]Vermont hosts 93 radio broadcast stations. The top categories are Talk/Information (11), Country (9), and Classic Rock (9). The top two owners of radio broadcast stations were Vermont Public Radio (11 broadcast frequencies + 13 low-power, local translators)[171] and Nassau Broadcasting III, LLC (6 broadcast frequencies + 6 translators based in Lebanon, NH). Other companies had five or fewer stations. The state has fifteen on-line radio stations.[172]Vermont hosts 10 high-power television broadcast stations, three of which are satellites of a primary station. Represented are the following networks and number of high-power transmitters, ABC (1), CBS (1), Fox (1), NBC (2), PBS (4), and RTV (1). In addition, it has 17 low-power television broadcast stations, which in several cases are satellites of the high-power stations.2008 peak demand in the state was 1,100 megawatts (MW).[173]In May 2009, Vermont created the first state-wide renewable energy feed-in law.[174] In 2010, there were about 150 methane digesters in the nation, Vermont led the nation with six online.[175]While Vermont paid the lowest rates in New England for power in 2007, it is still ranked among the highest eleven states in the nation; that is, about 16 percent higher than the national average.[176]In 2009, the state had the highest energy rates for energy (including heating) in the U.S. and the worst affordability gap nationwide.[95]In 2009, the state received one-third (400 MW)[173] of its power from Hydro-Qubec and one-third from Vermont Yankee.[177] In total, the state got half its power from Canada and other states. It received 75 percent of the power it generated in the state from Vermont Yankee.[178]The state's two largest electric utilities, Green Mountain Power Corporation and Central Vermont Public Service Corporation, together serve 80 percent of Vermont households.[95]Vermont experts estimate that the state has the capacity to ultimately generate from 134 to 175 megawatts of electricity from hydro power.[179]In 2006, the total summer generating capacity of Vermont was 1,117 megawatts.[180] In 2005, the inhabitants of the state used an average of 5,883 kilowatt hours of electricity per capita.[181] Another source says that each household consumed 7,100 kilowatt-hours annually in 2008.[182]Vermont has the highest rate of nuclear-generated power in the nation, 73.7 percent.[183] Vermont is one of two states with no coal-fired power plant.[184]All Vermont utilities get their power from lines run by ISO New England. Each utility pays a share of transmitting power over these lines. Vermont's share is about 4.5 percent.[185]The state has 78 hydropower dams. They generate 143 MW, about 12 percent of the state's total requirement.[173](Above percentages are of population, not of land area.)Generally, cell phone coverage in the state outside of the major metropolitan areas is weak due to interference from mountains. Attempts to serve a small rural population living in a large area renders investment in improvements uneconomical.[187] Unicel, which focused on rural areas and covered much of the state, is now owned by AT&T.[188]In May 2007, Vermont passed measures intended to make broadband (3Mbit minimum) together with cellular coverage universally available to all citizens with the intention of having the first e-state in the Union by 2010.[189] In 2010, 130,000 still had "poor" service. The state accepted a $116 million grant from the federal government. Representative Welch said that this would enable the state to advance from among the least connected, to one of the most connected states in the country.[190]In 2008 Comcast started to extend additional cable TV access throughout the state.[191] In 2007,two-thirds of all Vermonters had access to cable. At the end of this 2008 initiative, 90 percent of Vermonters will have access.Vermont is federally represented in the United States Congress by two senators and one representative.The state is governed by a constitution which divides governmental duties into legislative, executive and judicial branches: the Vermont General Assembly, the Governor of Vermont and the Vermont Supreme Court. The governorship and the General Assembly serve two-year terms including the governor and 30 senators. There are no term limits for any office. The state capital is in Montpelier.There are three types of incorporated municipalities in Vermont: towns, cities, and villages. Like most of New England, there is slight provision for autonomous county government. Counties and county seats are merely convenient repositories for various government services such as county and state courts, with several elected officers such as a State's Attorney and Sheriff. All county services are directly funded by the state of Vermont. The next effective governmental level below state government are municipalities. Most of these are towns.[192]Vermont is the only state in the union not to have a balanced budget requirement, yet Vermont has had a balanced budget every year since 1991.[193] In 2007, Moody's gave its top bond credit rating (Aaa) to the state.[194]The state uses enterprise funds for operations that are similar to private business enterprises. The Vermont Lottery Commission, the Liquor Control Fund, and the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, are the largest of the State's enterprise funds.[195]In 2007, Vermont was the 14th highest out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for state and local taxation, with a per capita load of $3,681. The national average was $3,447.[196] However, CNNMoney ranked Vermont highest in the nation based on the percentage of per capita income. The rankings showed Vermont had a per capita tax load of $5,387, 14.1 percent of the per capita income of $38,306.[197]Vermont collects a state personal income tax in a progressive structure of five different income brackets, with marginal tax rates ranging from 3.6 percent to 9.5 percent. In 2008, the top 1 percent of Vermont residents provided 30 percent of the income tax revenue; around 2,000 people had sufficient income to be taxed at the highest marginal rate of 9.5 percent.[198]Vermont's general state sales tax rate is 6 percent, which is imposed on sales of tangible personal property, amusement charges, fabrication charges, some public utility charges and some service contracts. Some towns and cities impose an additional 1 percent Local Option Tax. There are 46 exemptions from the sales tax, including exemptions for food, medical items, manufacturing machinery, equipment and fuel, residential fuel and electricity, clothing, and shoes. A use tax is imposed on the buyer at the same rate as the sales tax. The buyer pays the use tax when the seller fails to collect the sales tax or the items are purchased from a source where no tax is collected. The use tax applies to items taxable under the sales tax.Vermont does not collect inheritance taxes, but does impose a state estate tax; a Vermont estate tax return must be filed if the estate must file a federal estate tax return (the requirement for which depends on federal law).[199]Vermont does not collect a state gift tax.[199]Property taxes are levied by municipalities for the support of education and municipal services. Vermont does not assess tax on personal property.[200] Property taxes are based on appraisal of the fair market value of real property.[200] Rates vary from .97 percent on homesteaded property in Ferdinand, Essex County, to 2.72 percent on nonresidents' property in Barre City.[201] Statewide, towns average 1.77 percent to 1.82 percent tax rate. In 2007, Vermont counties were among the highest in the country for property taxes. Chittenden ($3,809 median), Windham ($3,412), Addison ($3,352), and Windsor ($3,327) ranked in the top 100, out of 1,817 counties in the nation with populations greater than 20,000. Twelve of the state's 14 counties stood in the top 20 percent.[202] Median annual property taxes as a percentage of median homeowners income, 5.4%, was rated as the third highest in the nation in 2011.[203][204]To equitably support education, some towns are required by Act 60 to send some of their collected taxes to be redistributed to school districts lacking adequate support.[205]Vermonters have been known for their political independence. Vermont is one of four states (aside from the original Thirteen Colonies) that were once independent nations (the others being Texas, California, and Hawaii). It has sometimes voted contrarian in national elections. Notably, Vermont is the only state to have voted for a presidential candidate from the Anti-Masonic Party, and Vermont was one of only two states to vote against Franklin D. Roosevelt in all four of his presidential campaigns (the other was Maine).Vermont's history of independent political thought has led to movements for the establishment of the Second Vermont Republic and other plans advocating secession.[206]Historically, Vermont was considered one of the most reliably Republican states in the country in terms of national elections. Prior to the 1990s, Vermont had voted Democratic only once, in Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide victory of 1964 against Barry M. Goldwater. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Republican presidential candidates frequently won the state with over 70 percent of the vote.In the meantime, many people had moved in from out of state.[citation needed] Much of this immigration included the arrival of more liberal political influences of the urban areas of New York and the rest of New England in Vermont.[citation needed]In 1992, it supported Democrat Bill Clinton for president, the first time the state had done so since 1964, and has voted Democratic in every presidential election since. Vermont gave John Kerry his fourth-largest margin of victory in 2004; he won the state's popular vote by 20 percentage points over incumbent George W. Bush, taking almost 59 percent of the vote. (Kerry, from neighboring Massachusetts, also became the first Northern Democrat ever to carry Vermont; Johnson was from Texas, Clinton from Arkansas and Al Gore, triumphant in the Green Mountain State in 2000, from Tennessee.) Essex County in the state's northeastern section was the only county to vote for Bush. Vermont is the only state that did not receive a visit from George W. Bush during his tenure as President of the United States.[citation needed] In the 2000 presidential election, Bush was the first Republican in American history to win the White House without carrying Vermont or Illinois.[207] Vermont gave Barack Obama his third largest winning margin (37 percentage points) winning there 6831%.Today, Vermont is one of only two states represented by a member of the United States Congress who does not currently associate with a political party: Senator Bernie Sanders describes his political views as democratic socialist, but is officially registered as an independent and caucuses with the Democrats in the selection of the Senate leadership.[208]Republicans dominated local Vermont politics from the party's founding in 1854 until the mid-1970s. Prior to the 1960s, rural interests dominated the legislature. As a result, cities, particularly the older sections of Burlington and Winooski, were neglected and fell into decay. People began to move out to newer suburbs.A series of one man, one vote decisions made by the United States Supreme Court in the 1960s required states to redraw their legislative districts to more fairly reflect population. As a result, urban areas in Vermont began to regain some political power.After the legislature was redistricted under one-person, one-vote in the 1960s, it passed legislation to accommodate[clarification needed] the new arrivals to the state. This legislation was the Land Use and Development Law (Act 250) in 1970. The law, which was the first of its kind in the nation, created nine District Environmental Commissions consisting of private citizens, appointed by the Governor, who must approve land development and subdivision plans that would have a significant impact on the state's environment and many small communities. As a result of Act 250, Vermont was the last state to get a Wal-Mart (there are now four in the state, as of December 2009, but only the Williston store was new construction). Because of the success of Act 250, subsequent attempts to dilute its power, and other development pressures, Vermont has been designated one of America's most "endangered historic places" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.[209]While the state voted largely Democratic, Republican Governor Douglas won all counties but Windham in the 2006 election.A recent controversy was over the adoption of civil unions, an institution which grants same-sex couples nearly all the rights and privileges of marriage at the state, but not federal, level. In Baker v. Vermont (1999), the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that, under the Constitution of Vermont, the state must either allow same-sex marriage or provide a separate but equal status for them. The state legislature chose the second option by creating the institution of civil union; the bill was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor Howard Dean. In April 2009 the state legislature overrode governor Jim Douglas's veto to allow same-sex marriage, becoming the first state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage through legislation.[210] In September 2009, Vermont became one of six states in which same-sex couples could marry.[211]In 2007, the state's House of Representatives rejected a measure which would have legalized assisted suicide for the terminally ill, by a vote of 8263.[212]Minor parties and Independents flourish. Rules which eliminate smaller parties from the ballot in most states do not exist in Vermont. As a result, voters often have extensive choices for general elections. This has resulted in the election to Mayor of Burlington and then to U.S. Congressman of Bernie Sanders, then a Socialist, and later, as an Independent, to U.S. Senator.A political issue has been Act 60, which balances taxation for education funding. This has resulted in the town of Killington trying to secede from Vermont and join New Hampshire due to what the locals say is an unfair tax burden.[213][214]The Vermont constitution and the courts supports the right of a person to walk (fish and hunt) on any unposted, unfenced land. That is, trespass must be proven by the owner; it is not automatically assumed.[215]The state is an alcoholic beverage control state. In 2007, through the Vermont Department of Liquor Control, it took in over $14 million from the sale and distribution of liquor.[216]In 2010 Vermont was the sixth highest ranked state for Well-Being in a study by Gallup and Healthways.[217] In 2010, the state stood third in physical well-being of children.[218]In 2010, Vermont was ranked the highest in the country for health outcomes.[219]In 2008 Vermont was ranked number one in the nation as the healthiest place to live for the seventh time in eight years. Criteria included low teenage birth rate, strong health coverage, the lowest AIDS rate in the country, and 18 other factors.[220] The state scored well in cessation of smoking, obesity, fewer occupational fatalities, prevalence of health insurance, and low infant mortality. A problem area was a high prevalence of binge drinking.[221] While ranking sixth from best for adults in obesity in 2009, the state still had 22% obese with a rate of 27% for children 1017. The ranking for children was ninth best in the nation.[222] In 1993, the obesity rate for adults was 12%. Vermonters spend $141 million annually in medical costs related to obesity.[223] The combined figures for overweight and obese adults rose from 40.7% in 1990 to 58.4% in 2010. This is better than most other states.[224]In 2011, Vermont led the nation in the rate of young people who had consumed alcohol in the past month; one-third of people aged 11 through 20. One-fifth of that group had binged during that time. The state was second for the use of marijuana by young people; 30% of adults 18 to 25 in the past month.[225]In 2009, Vermont was ranked second in the nation for safety. Crime statistics on violence were used for the criteria.[226] Vermont has some of the least restrictive gun control laws in the country. A permit or license is not required for purchasing or carrying firearms. Concealed Carry and Open Carry of a firearm is legal over the age of 16, with those below 16 requiring parental permission.[227][228][229][230]In 2007, Vermont was ranked among the best five states in the country for preventing "premature death" in people under 75 years of age. The rate of survival was twice that of the five lowest performing states.[231]In 2007, Vermont was ranked the third safest state for highway fatalities.[232] In 2007, a third of fatal crashes involved a drunken driver.[233] In 2008, Vermont was the fifth best state for fewest uninsured motorists  6%.[234]Parts of the state have been declared federal disaster areas on 28 occasions from 1963 to 2008.[235]In 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency cited Chittenden and Bennington as counties with 70 parts per billion of smog which is undesirable.[236]In northern Vermont particularly, moose are not uncommon, including in urban areas.[237] They constitute a traffic threat since they are unaware of vehicles. There are several deaths each year from automobiles striking moose.In 2008, about 100,000 Vermonters got their health care through the federal government, Medicare, Tri-Care and the Veteran's Administration. An additional 10,000 work for employers who provide insurance under federal law under ERISA. About 20% of Vermonters receive health care outside of Vermont; 20% of the care provided within the state is to non-Vermonters.[238] In 2008, the state had an estimated 7.6% with no medical insurance, down from 9.8% in 2005.[239] In 2008, the Vermont Health Access Program for low-income, uninsured adults cost from $7 to $49 per month.[240] A "Catamount Health" premium assistance program was available for Vermonters who do not qualify for other programs. Total monthly premiums ranged from $60 to $393 for an individual. There was a $250 deductible. Insured paid $10 toward each generic prescription. 16.9% of residents 18 to 35 were uninsured, the highest group.[241]Health care spending increased from $2.3 billion in 2000 to $4.8 billion in 2009.[242] In 2009, adult day care services cost more in Vermont than any other state  $150 daily.[243]The state started air drops of rabies bait for raccoons in 1997. Known rabies cases in raccoons peaked in 2007 at 165. The program is in cooperation with neighboring states and Canada.[244]Vermont was named the nation's smartest state in 2005 and 2006.[245] In 2006, there was a gap between state testing standards and national which is biased in favor of the state standards by 30%, on average. This puts Vermont 11th best in the nation. Most states have a higher bias.[246] However, when allowance for race is considered, a 2007 US Government list of test scores shows Vermont white fourth graders performed 25th in the nation for reading (229), 26th for math (247).[247] White eight graders scored 18th for math (292) and 12th for reading (273). The first three scores were not considered statistically different from average. White eighth graders scored significantly above average in reading. Statistics for black students were not reliable because of their small representation in the testing.The average effective spending per pupil in Vermont was $11,548 in 2008.[248]Education Week ranked the state second[249] in high school graduation rates for 2007.[250]Experimentation at the University of Vermont by George Perkins Marsh, and later the influence of Vermont-born philosopher and educator John Dewey brought about the concepts of electives and learning by doing.Vermont has five colleges within the Vermont State Colleges system, University of Vermont (UVM), and fourteen other private, degree-granting colleges, including Bennington College, Burlington College, Champlain College, Goddard College, Marlboro College, Middlebury College, Saint Michael's College, the Vermont Law School, and Norwich University.Notable in the field are Olympic gold medalists Hannah Teter, Ross Powers and Hannah Kearney.The largest professional franchise is the Vermont Lake Monsters, a single-A minor league baseball affiliate of the Oakland Athletics, based in Burlington. They were named the Vermont Expos prior to 2006.[251] Up until the 2011 season, they were the affiliate of the Washington Nationals (formerly the Montreal Expos).The Vermont Frost Heaves, the 2007 and 2008 American Basketball Association national champions, were a franchise of the Premier Basketball League, and were based in Barre and Burlington from the fall of 2006 through the winter of 2011.A semi-professional football team, the Vermont Ice Storm, is[252] based in South Hero.[253] It plays its home games at the Colchester High School stadium. It is a member of the Empire Football League.Vermont natives in the snowboarding profession include: Kevin Pearce, Ross Powers, Hannah Teter, and Kelly Clark. Others learned snowboarding in the state such as: Louie Vito, and Ellery Hollingsworth.The Vermont Voltage is a USL Premier Development League soccer club that plays in St. Albans.Annually since 2002, high school statewide all stars compete against New Hampshire in ten sports during "Twin State" playoffs.[254]Vermont festivals include the Vermont Maple Festival, Festival on the Green,[255] The Vermont Dairy Festival in Enosburg Falls,[256] the Apple Festival (held each Columbus Day Weekend), the Marlboro Music Festival, the Vermont Mozart Festival, and the Vermont Brewers Festival.[257] The Vermont Symphony Orchestra is supported by the state and performs throughout the area.Since 1973 the Sage City Symphony, formed by composer Louis Calabro, has performed in the Bennington area. In 1988 a number of Vermont-based composers including Gwyneth Walker formed the Vermont Composers Consortium,[258][259] which was recognized by the governor proclaiming 2011 as The Year of the Composer.[260]The Brattleboro-based Vermont Theatre Company presents an annual summer Shakespeare festival. Brattleboro also hosts the summertime Strolling of the Heifers parade which celebrates Vermont's unique dairy culture. The annual Green Mountain Film Festival is held in Montpelier.In the Northeast Kingdom, the Bread and Puppet Theatre holds weekly shows in Glover in a natural outdoor amphitheater.Vermont's most recent best known musical talent was the group Phish, whose members met while attending school in Vermont and spent much of their early years playing at venues across the state.The Vermont-based House of LeMay[261] performs several shows a year, hosts the annual "Winter is a Drag Ball,"[262] and performs for fundraisers.Examples of folk art found in Vermont include the Vermontasaurus in Post Mills, a community in Thetford.The rate of volunteerism in Vermont was eighth in the nation with 37% in 2007. The state stood first in New England.[263] In 2011, Vermont residents were ranked as the healthiest in the country.[264] Also in 2011, Vermont was ranked as the fourth most peaceful state in the United States.[265] In 2011, Vermont residents were ranked as the sixth most fit/leanest in the country.[266] Vermonters were the second most active citizens of state with 55.9% meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's physical activity requirements.[267] Vermont was ranked as the twelfth happiest state in the country.[268]There are a number of museums in the state.State symbols include:Vermont is the birthplace of former U.S. Presidents Chester A. Arthur and Calvin Coolidge.Coordinates: 4400N 7242W / 44N 72.7W / 44; -72.7

Raymond "Ray" Kurzweil (/krzwal/ KURZ-wyl; born February 12, 1948) is an American author, inventor, and futurist. Aside from futurology, he is involved in fields such as optical character recognition (OCR), text-to-speech synthesis, speech recognition technology, and electronic keyboard instruments. He is the author of several books on health, artificial intelligence (AI), transhumanism, the technological singularity, and futurism. Kurzweil is generally recognized as a public advocate for the futurist and transhumanist movements, due to his stances on life extension technologies, his efforts to forecast future advances in technology, and his interest in the concept of the technological singularity. At the same time, he has attracted significant criticism from scientists and thinkers.Ray Kurzweil grew up in the New York City borough of Queens. He was born to secular Jewish parents who had escaped Austria just before the onset of World War II, and he was exposed via Unitarian Universalism to a diversity of religious faiths during his upbringing. His father was a musician and composer and his mother was a visual artist. His uncle, an engineer at Bell Labs, taught young Ray the basics of computer science.[1] In his youth, he was an avid reader of science fiction literature. In 1963, at age fifteen, he wrote his first computer program.[2] Later in high school he created a pattern-recognition software program that analyzed the works of classical composers, and then synthesized its own songs in similar styles. In 1965, he was invited to appear on the CBS television program I've Got a Secret, where he performed a piano piece that was composed by a computer he also had built.[3] Later that year, he won first prize in the International Science Fair for the invention;[4] he was also recognized by the Westinghouse Talent Search and was personally congratulated by President Lyndon B. Johnson during a White House ceremony.In 1968, during his sophomore year at MIT, Kurzweil started a company that used a computer program to match high school students with colleges. The program, called the Select College Consulting Program, was designed by him and compared thousands of different criteria about each college with questionnaire answers submitted by each student applicant. When he was 20, he sold the company to Harcourt, Brace & World for $100,000 (roughly $500,000 in 2006 dollars) plus royalties.[5] He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Literature in 1970 from MIT.In 1974, Kurzweil started the company Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. and led development of the first omni-font optical character recognition systema computer program capable of recognizing text written in any normal font. Before that time, scanners had only been able to read text written in a few fonts. He decided that the best application of this technology would be to create a reading machine, which would allow blind people to understand written text by having a computer read it to them aloud. However, this device required the invention of two enabling technologiesthe CCD flatbed scanner and the text-to-speech synthesizer. Development of these technologies was completed at other institutions such as Bell Labs, and on January 13, 1976, the finished product was unveiled during a news conference headed by him and the leaders of the National Federation of the Blind. Called the Kurzweil Reading Machine, the device covered an entire tabletop. It gained him mainstream recognition: on the day of the machine's unveiling, Walter Cronkite used the machine to give his signature soundoff, "And that's the way it is, January13, 1976." While listening to The Today Show, musician Stevie Wonder heard a demonstration of the device and purchased the first production version of the Kurzweil Reading Machine, beginning a lifelong friendship with Kurzweil.Kurzweil's next major business venture began in 1978, when Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program. LexisNexis was one of the first customers, and bought the program to upload paper legal and news documents onto its nascent online databases.Two years later, Kurzweil sold his company to Lernout & Hauspie. Following the bankruptcy of the latter, the system became a subsidiary of Xerox formerly known as Scansoft and now as Nuance Communications, and he functioned as a consultant for the former until 1995.Kurzweil's next business venture was in the realm of electronic music technology. After a 1982 meeting with Stevie Wonder, in which the latter lamented the divide in capabilities and qualities between electronic synthesizers and traditional musical instruments, Kurzweil was inspired to create a new generation of music synthesizers capable of accurately duplicating the sounds of real instruments. Kurzweil Music Systems was founded in the same year, and in 1984, the Kurzweil K250 was unveiled. The machine was capable of imitating a number of instruments, and in tests musicians were unable to discern the difference between the Kurzweil K250 on piano mode from a normal grand piano.[6] The recording and mixing abilities of the machine, coupled with its abilities to imitate different instruments made it possible for a single user to compose and play an entire orchestral piece.Kurzweil Music Systems was sold to Korean musical instrument manufacturer Young Chang in 1990. As with Xerox, Kurzweil remained as a consultant for several years. Hyundai acquired Young Chang in 2006 and in January 2007 has appointed Raymond Kurzweil as Chief Strategy Officer of Kurzweil Music Systems.[7]Concurrent with Kurzweil Music Systems, Kurzweil created the company Kurzweil Applied Intelligence (KAI) to develop computer speech recognition systems for commercial use. The first product, which debuted in 1987, was an early speech recognition program.Kurzweil started Kurzweil Educational Systems in 1996 to develop new pattern-recognition-based computer technologies to help people with disabilities such as blindness, dyslexia and ADD in school. Products include the Kurzweil 1000 text-to-speech converter software program, which enables a computer to read electronic and scanned text aloud to blind or visually impaired users, and the Kurzweil 3000 program, which is a multifaceted electronic learning system that helps with reading, writing, and study skills.During the 1990s Kurzweil founded the Medical Learning Company.[8] The company's products included an interactive computer education program for doctors and a computer-simulated patient. Around the same time, Kurzweil started KurzweilCyberArt.coma website featuring computer programs to assist the creative art process. The site used to offer free downloads of a program called AARONa visual art synthesizer developed by Harold Cohenand of "Kurzweil's Cybernetic Poet", which automatically creates poetry. During this period he also started KurzweilAI.net, a website devoted towards showcasing news of scientific developments, publicizing the ideas of high-tech thinkers and critics alike, and promoting futurist-related discussion among the general population through the Mind-X forum.In 1999, Kurzweil created a hedge fund called "FatKat" (Financial Accelerating Transactions from Kurzweil Adaptive Technologies), which began trading in 2006. He has stated that the ultimate aim is to improve the performance of FatKat's A.I. investment software program, enhancing its ability to recognize patterns in "currency fluctuations and stock-ownership trends."[9] He predicted in his 1999 book, The Age of Spiritual Machines, that computers will one day prove superior to the best human financial minds at making profitable investment decisions. In 2001, Canadian rock band Our Lady Peace released an album, titled Spiritual Machines, based on Kurzweil's book. Kurzweil's voice was featured in the album, reading excerpts from his book.In June 2005, Kurzweil introduced the "Kurzweil-National Federation of the Blind Reader" (K-NFB Reader)a pocket-sized device consisting of a digital camera and computer unit. Like the Kurzweil Reading Machine of almost 30 years before, the K-NFB Reader is designed to aid blind people by reading written text aloud. The newer machine is portable and scans text through digital camera images, while the older machine is large and scans text through flatbed scanning.Kurzweil made a movie called The Singularity Is Near: A True Story About the Future[10] in 2010 based, in part, on his 2005 book The Singularity Is Near. Part fiction, part non-fiction, he interviews 20 big thinkers like Marvin Minsky, plus there is a B-line narrative story that illustrates some of the ideas, where a computer avatar (Ramona) saves the world from self-replicating microscopic robots. In addition to his movie, an independent, feature-length documentary was made about Kurzweil, his life, and his ideas called Transcendent Man. Filmmakers Barry Ptolemy and Felicia Ptolemy followed Kurzweil, documenting his global speaking tour. Premiered in 2009 at the Tribeca Film Festival,[10] Transcendent Man documents Kurzweil's quest to reveal mankind's ultimate destiny and explores many of the ideas found in his New York Times bestselling book, The Singularity Is Near, including his concept exponential growth, radical life expansion, and how we will transcend our biology. The Ptolemys documented Kurzweil's stated goal of bringing back his late father using AI. The film also features critics who argue against Kurzweil's predictions.In 2010, an independent documentary film called Plug & Pray premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival, in which Kurzweil and one of his major critics, the late Joseph Weizenbaum, argue about the benefits of eternal life.[11]Kurzweil frequently comments on the application of cell-size nanotechnology to the workings of the human brain and how this could be applied to building AI. While being interviewed for a February 2009 issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Kurzweil expressed a desire to construct a genetic copy of his late father, Fredric Kurzweil, from DNA within his grave site. This feat would be achieved by exhumation and extraction of DNA, constructing a clone of Fredric and retrieving memories and recollectionsfrom Ray's mindof his father.[12]Kurzweil is married with two children. His wife, Sonya, is a child psychologist while his son works as a venture capitalist and his daughter a choreographer.[13]Kurzweil's first book, The Age of Intelligent Machines, was published in 1990. The nonfiction work discusses the history of computer AI and also makes forecasts regarding future developments. Other experts in the field of AI contribute heavily to the work in the form of essays. The Association of American Publishers' awarded it the status of Most Outstanding Computer Science Book of 1990.[14]Next, Kurzweil published a book on nutrition in 1993 called The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life. The book's main idea is that high levels of fat intake are the cause of many health disorders common in the U.S., and thus that cutting fat consumption down to 10% of the total calories consumed would be optimal for most people.In 1998, Kurzweil published The Age of Spiritual Machines, which focuses heavily on further elucidating his theories regarding the future of technology, which themselves stem from his analysis of long-term trends in biological and technological evolution. Much focus goes into examining the likely course of AI development, along with the future of computer architecture.Kurzweil's next book published in 2004, returned to the subject of human health and nutrition. Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever was co-authored by Kurzweil and Terry Grossman, a medical doctor and specialist in alternative medicine. The Singularity Is Near was published in 2005. The book was made into a movie starring Pauley Perrette (NCIS).[15] In February 2007, Ptolemaic Productions acquired the rights to The Singularity is Near, The Age of Spiritual Machines and Fantastic Voyage including the rights to Kurzweil's life and ideas for the film Transcendent Man. The feature length documentary was directed by Barry Ptolemy.Transcend: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever,[16] a follow-up to Fantastic Voyage, was released on April 28, 2009.Kurzweil's latest book, How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed, was released on November 13, 2012.[17] Kurzweil has explored for decades the potential for artificial intelligence to enrich and increase human capabilities. Now, in his newest book he brings it all up a level by delving into reverse-engineering the brain to understand precisely how it works, and then applying that knowledge to create extremely intelligent machines. Kurzweil describes his new theory of how the neocortex, or the thinking part of the brain, works: as a self-organizing hierarchical system of pattern recognizers by compiling the most recent neuroscience research, his own research and inventions in artificial intelligence, and convincing thought experiments. He then goes on to show how such insights will enable people to greatly improve the powers of our own mind and at the same time provides a roadmap for the creation of superintelligence.[18]He is also writing a novel called Danielle, about his imaginary superheroine daughter who solves problems through intelligence.[19]Kurzweil was referred to by Forbes as "the ultimate thinking machine."[20]Kurzweil has received many awards and honors, including:Kurzweil's central argument is derived from the predictions of Moore's Law that the rate of innovation of computer technology is increasing not linearly but rather exponentially. According to Kurzweil's argument, since growth in so many fields of science and technology depends upon computing power, these improvements translate into exponentially more frequent advances in non-computer sciences like nanotechnology, biotechnology, and materials science. Kurzweil refers to this concept as the "Law of Accelerating Returns", and has asserted that this is supported by a number of metrics.Kurzweil has forecast a number of specific technological advances with specific dates in his books, stating that before 2050 medical advances will allow people to radically extend their lifespans while preserving quality of life through the use of nanobots,[3][37] that a computer will pass the Turing test by 2029, that the first strong artificial intelligence will be a computer simulation of a human brain generated by nanorobotic brain scanning, sentient artificial intelligences will exhibit moral thinking and respect humans, and that the line between humans and machines will blur as machines attain human-level intelligence and humans start incorporating more technology.Kurzweil's application of his law to forecasting innovations have been disputed by other scientists and writers.[38]Kurzweil's standing as a futurist and Transhumanist has led to his involvement in several Singularity-themed organizations. In December 2004, Kurzweil joined the advisory board of the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence.[39] In October 2005, Kurzweil joined the scientific advisory board of the Lifeboat Foundation.[40] On May 13, 2006, Kurzweil was the first speaker at the Singularity Summit at Stanford.[41]In February 2009, Kurzweil, in collaboration with Google and the NASA Ames Research Center, announced the creation of the Singularity University training center for corporate executives and government officials. The University's self-described mission is to "assemble, educate and inspire a cadre of leaders who strive to understand and facilitate the development of exponentially advancing technologies and apply, focus and guide these tools to address humanitys grand challenges".[42] Using Vernor Vinge's Singularity concept as a foundation, the University offered its first nine-week graduate program to forty students in June, 2009.Kurzweil is on the Army Science Advisory Board, has testified before Congress on the subject of nanotechnology, and has advocated that nanotechnology could solve significant global problems such as poverty, disease, and climate change, viz. "Nanotech Could Give Global Warming a Big Chill ".[43] In media appearances, Kurzweil has stressed the extreme potential dangers of nanotechnology,[3] but argues that in practice, progress cannot be stopped, and any attempt to do so will retard the progress of defensive and beneficial technologies more than the malevolent ones, increasing the danger. He suggests that the proper place of regulation is to make sure progress proceeds safely and quickly.In his 1999 book The Age of Spiritual Machines Kurzweil proposed "The Law of Accelerating Returns", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially.[44] He gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled "The Law of Accelerating Returns", which proposed an extension of Moore's law to a wide variety of technologies, and used this to argue in favor of Vernor Vinge's concept of a technological singularity.[45]Kurzweil's first book, The Age of Intelligent Machines, presented his ideas about the future. It was written from 1986 to 1989 and published in 1990. Building on Ithiel de Sola Pool's "Technologies of Freedom" (1983), Kurzweil claims to have forecast the demise of the Soviet Union due to new technologies such as cellular phones and fax machines disempowering authoritarian governments by removing state control over the flow of information. In the book Kurzweil also extrapolated preexisting trends in the improvement of computer chess software performance to predict correctly that computers would beat the best human players by 1998, and most likely in that year. In fact, the event occurred in May 1997 when chess World Champion Garry Kasparov was defeated by IBM's Deep Blue computer in a well-publicized chess tournament. Perhaps most significantly, Kurzweil foresaw the explosive growth in worldwide Internet use that began in the 1990s. At the time of the publication of The Age of Intelligent Machines, there were only 2.6 million Internet users in the world,[46] and the medium was unreliable, difficult to use, and deficient in content. He also stated that the Internet would explode not only in the number of users but in content as well, eventually granting users access "to international networks of libraries, data bases, and information services". Additionally, Kurzweil claims to have correctly foreseen that the preferred mode of Internet access would inevitably be through wireless systems, and he was also correct to estimate that the latter would become practical for widespread use in the early 21st century.Kurzweil also claims to have accurately forecast that, by the end of the 1990s, many documents would exist solely in computers and on the Internet, and that they would commonly be embedded with sounds, animations, and videos that would inhibit their transfer to paper format. Moreover, he claims to have foreseen that cellular phones would grow in popularity while shrinking in size for the foreseeable future.In 1999, Kurzweil published a second book titled The Age of Spiritual Machines, which goes into more depth explaining his futurist ideas. The third and final section of the book is devoted to elucidating the specific course of technological advancements Kurzweil predicts the world will experience over the next century.While this book focuses on the future of technology and the human race as did The Age of Intelligent Machines and The Age of Spiritual Machines, Kurzweil makes very few concrete, short-term predictions in The Singularity Is Near, though longer-term visions are present in abundance. He discussed the singularity with Vice Magazine in April 2009.[47]In 2008, Ray Kurzweil said in an expert panel in the National Academy of Engineering that solar power will scale up to produce all the energy needs of Earth's people in 20 years.[48]Kurzweil admits that he cared little for his health until age 35, when he was found to suffer from a glucose intolerance, an early form of type II diabetes (a major risk factor for heart disease). Kurzweil then found a doctor who shares his non-conventional beliefs to develop an extreme regimen involving hundreds of pills, chemical intravenous treatments, red wine and various other methods to attempt to live longer. Kurzweil ingests "250 supplements, eight to 10 glasses of alkaline water and 10 cups of green tea" every day and drinks several glasses of red wine a week in an effort to "reprogram" his biochemistry.[49] Lately, he has cut down the number of supplement pills to 150.[50]Kurzweil joined the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, a cryonics company. In the event of his death, Kurzweil's body will be chemically preserved, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at an Alcor facility in the hope that future medical technology will be able to revive him.[51]He has authored three books on the subjects of nutrition, health and immortality: The 10% Solution for a Healthy Life, Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever and TRANSCEND: Nine Steps to Living Well Forever.[52] In all, he recommends that other people emulate his health practices to the best of their abilities. Kurzweil and his current "anti-aging" doctor, Terry Grossman, MD., now have two websites promoting their first[53] and second book.[54]He has stated that in the future, he believes everyone will live forever.[55]Kurzweil's ideas have generated criticism within the scientific community and in the media.Although the idea of a technological singularity is a popular concept in science fiction, some authors such as Neal Stephenson[56] and Bruce Sterling have voiced skepticism about its real-world plausibility. Sterling expressed his views on the singularity scenario in a talk at the Long Now Foundation entitled The Singularity: Your Future as a Black Hole.[57][58] Other prominent AI thinkers and computer scientists such as Daniel Dennett,[59] Rodney Brooks,[60] David Gelernter[61] and Paul Allen[62] also criticized Kurzweils projections.Daniel Lyons, writing in Newsweek, criticized Kurzweil for some of his predictions which turned out to be wrong; such as the economy continuing to boom from the 1998 dot-com through 2009, a US company having a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion, a supercomputer achieving 20 petaflops, speech recognition being in widespread use and cars that would drive themselves using sensors installed in highways; all by 2009.[63] To the charge that a 20 petaflop supercomputer was not produced in the time he predicted, Kurzweil responded that he considers Google a giant supercomputer, and that it is indeed capable of 20 petaflops.[63] In 2009, IBM announced the commencement of its development of the IBM Sequoia for the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, which is capable of 20+ petaflops and is expected to be delivered in 2011,[non-primary source needed] two years after Kurzweil's prediction.[64]In the cover article of the December 2010 issue of IEEE Spectrum, John Rennie criticizes Kurzweil for several predictions that failed to become manifest by the originally predicted date. "Therein lie the frustrations of Kurzweil's brand of tech punditry. On close examination, his clearest and most successful predictions often lack originality or profundity. And most of his predictions come with so many loopholes that they border on the unfalsifiable."[65]Bill Joy, cofounder of Sun Microsystems, agrees with Kurzweil's timeline of future progress, but thinks that technologies such as AI, nanotechnology and advanced biotechnology will create a dystopian world.[66] Mitch Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development Corporation, has called the notion of a technological singularity "intelligent design for the IQ 140 people...This proposition that we're heading to this point at which everything is going to be just unimaginably differentit's fundamentally, in my view, driven by a religious impulse. And all of the frantic arm-waving can't obscure that fact for me."[67]Some critics have argued more strongly against Kurzweil and his ideas. Cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter has said of Kurzweil's and Hans Moravec's books: "Its as if you took a lot of very good food and some dog excrement and blended it all up so that you can't possibly figure out what's good or bad. It's an intimate mixture of rubbish and good ideas, and it's very hard to disentangle the two, because these are smart people; they're not stupid."[68] Biologist P. Z. Myers has criticized Kurzweil's predictions as being based on "New Age spiritualism" rather than science and says that Kurzweil does not understand basic biology.[69][70] VR pioneer Jaron Lanier has even described Kurzweils ideas as cybernetic totalism and has outlined his views on the culture surrounding Kurzweils predictions in an essay for Edge.org entitled One Half of a Manifesto.[71]1 Life, inventions, and business career

Cypress Hill is an American hip hop group from South Gate, California. Cypress Hill was the first Cuban-American/Latino hip hop group to have platinum and multi-platinum albums, selling over 18 million albums worldwide. They are one of the most well-known groups in West Coast rap and Hip Hop in general and are critically acclaimed for their first two groundbreaking albums.[1]Senen Reyes (also known as Sen Dog) and Ulpiano Sergio Reyes (also known as Mellow Man Ace) are brothers who initially lived in South Gate, California. In 1971, their family had immigrated to the United States from Cuba. In 1988, the two brothers teamed up with Lawrence Muggerud (also known as DJ Muggs) and Louis Freese (also known as B-Real) to form a hip-hop group named DVX (Devastating Vocal Excellence). The band soon lost Mellow Man Ace to a solo career, and changed their name to Cypress Hill, after a street in South Gate.[2]After recording a demo in 1989, Cypress Hill signed a record deal with the major label, Columbia Records. Their self-titled first album was released in August 1991. The lead single was the double A-side "The Phuncky Feel One"/"How I Could Just Kill a Man" which received heavy airplay on urban and college radio. The other two singles released from the album were "Hand on the Pump" and "Latin Lingo", the latter of which combined English and Spanish lyrics. The success of these singles led to the album selling two million copies in the US alone. The group made their first appearance at Lollapalooza on the side stage in 1992.Black Sunday, the group's second album, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1993, recording the highest Soundscan for a rap group up until that time. Also, with their debut still in the charts, they became the first rap group to have 2 albums in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 at the same time. With "Insane in the Brain" becoming a crossover hit, the album went triple platinum in the U.S. and sold about 3.25 million copies.The band headlined the Soul Assassins tour with House of Pain and Funkdoobiest as support, then performed on a college tour with Rage Against the Machine and Seven Year Bitch. In 1993, Cypress Hill also had two tracks on the Judgment Night soundtrack, teaming up with Pearl Jam on the track "Real Thing" and Sonic Youth on "I Love You Mary Jane".The group later played at Woodstock 94, introducing new member Eric Bobo, son of Willie Bobo and formerly a percussionist with the Beastie Boys. Rolling Stone magazine named the group as the best rap group in their music awards voted by critics and readers. Cypress Hill played at Lollapalooza for two successive years, topping the bill in 1995. They also appeared on the "Homerpalooza" episode of The Simpsons. Prior to Bobo joining the crew, Panchito "Ponch" Gomez sat in as a percussionist when not acting.Their third album III: Temples of Boom was released in 1995, selling 1.5 million copies and reaching number 3 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the hit single "Throw Your Set in the Air".[citation needed] Cypress Hill also contributed a track "I Wanna Get High" to the High Times sponsored Hempilation album to support NORML.Sen Dog took a break from the band to form a Los Angeles based rap rock band SX-10.[3] Meanwhile in 1996, Cypress Hill appeared on the first Smokin' Grooves tour, featuring Ziggy Marley, The Fugees, Busta Rhymes and A Tribe Called Quest. The band also released a nine track EP Unreleased and Revamped with rare mixes. In 1997, band members focused on their solo careers. Muggs released Soul Assassins: Chapter 1 featuring contributions from Dr. Dre, KRS-One, Wyclef Jean and Mobb Deep. B-Real appeared with Busta Rhymes, Coolio, LL Cool J and Method Man on "Hit Em High" from the multi-platinum Space Jam Soundtrack. He also appeared with RBX, Nas and KRS-One on "East Coast Killer, West Coast Killer" from Dr. Dre's Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath album, and contributed to an album entitled The Psycho Realm with the band of the same name. Though the focus that year was not on group efforts, the band played Smokin' Grooves with George Clinton and Erykah Badu.Cypress Hill released IV in 1998 which went gold in the US, on the backs of hit singles "Tequila Sunrise" and "Dr. Greenthumb". Sen Dog also released the Get Wood sampler as part of SX-10 on the label Flip. In 1999, Cypress Hill helped with the PC crime video game Kingpin: Life of Crime. Three of their songs from the 1998 IV album were in the game ( "16 Men Till There's No Men Left", "Checkmate" and "Lightning Strikes"). B-Real also did some of the voices of the people in the game. Also in 1999, the band released a greatest-hits album in Spanish, Los grandes xitos en espaol. In 2000, Cypress Hill then fused genres with their fifth album, Skull & Bones, which was a two-disc album. The first disc, "Skull" was composed of rap tracks while "Bones" explored further the group's forays into rock. The album reached the Top 5 on the Billboard 200 and number 3 in Canada. The first single was "Rock Superstar" for rock radio and "Rap Superstar" for urban radio. Following the release of the album, Cypress Hill (along with MxPx) landed a slot opening for The Offspring on the Conspiracy of One tour. The band also released Live at the Fillmore, a concert disc recorded at the Fillmore (in San Francisco) in 2000. Cypress Hill continued their experimentation with rock on the Stoned Raiders album in 2001. However, its sales were a disappointment, as the disc did not even reach the top 50 of the US album charts. In 2001, the group appeared in the film How High.Cypress Hill recorded "Just Another Victim" for WWE as a theme song for Tazz. At the time, WWE was using original music for almost all of the wrestlers. The band released Till Death Do Us Part on March 23, 2004. The album saw the band experiment with reggae especially on the lead single "What's Your Number". The track features Tim Armstrong of Rancid on guitar and backup vocals. It is based on the classic song "The Guns of Brixton" on The Clash's London Calling and has proven to be a success on the modern rock charts. However, the album represented a further departure from the signature sound of their first four albums. The album also features appearances by Damian Marley, son of Bob Marley, Prodigy of Mobb Deep and producers the Alchemist and Fredwreck.In 2004, the song "How I Could Just Kill A Man" was included in the popular video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas created by Rockstar Games, playing on West Coast hip hop radio station Radio Los Santos. In December 2005 a best of compilation album titled Greatest Hits From the Bong was released including nine hits from previous albums and two new tracks. The group's next album was tentatively scheduled for an early 2007 release. In the summer of 2006, B-Real appeared on Snoop Dogg's single "Vato", which was produced by Pharrell Williams.In 2007 Cypress Hill toured with their full line up as a part of the Rock the Bells tour, held by Guerilla Union, and headlined with Public Enemy, Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, and a reunited Rage Against the Machine. Other acts included Immortal Technique, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, The Roots, EPMD, Pharoahe Monch, Jedi Mind Tricks, Erykah Badu, MF Doom, Sage Francis, Brother Ali, The Coup, Blue Print, Lucky I Am, Living Legends, Felt, Cage, Mr. Lif, Grouch & Eligh, Slightly Stoopid, and Hangar 18.On July 25, 2008, Cypress Hill performed at a benefit concert at the House of Blues Chicago, where a majority of the proceeds went to the Chicago Alliance to End Homelessness.[4]In August 2009, a new song by Cypress Hill, titled "Get 'Em Up", was made available on iTunes. The song is featured on the Madden NFL 2010 video game.[5]In November 2009, a new version of the Guns N' Roses classic "Paradise City" performed by Cypress Hill, Slash and Fergie was made available as a bonus track to Slash's single "Sahara" from Slash's solo album Slash.Cypress Hill's eighth studio album Rise Up, features contributions from Everlast, Tom Morello, Daron Malakian, Pitbull, Marc Anthony and Mike Shinoda.[6] The album was released on Priority Records/EMI Entertainment, as the group was signed to the label by new Creative Chairman Snoop Dogg on January 15, 2010. The album was released on April 20, 2010.[7] The album's introduction single, "It Ain't Nothin'" was released as a free download from the group's official website. The song "Rise Up" was featured at WWE's pay-per-view, Elimination Chamber, as the official theme song for that event, and was released as the third single for the album, with "Armada Latina" being fourth. The song also appeared in the trailer of the movie The Green Hornet.Cypress Hill commenced its Rise Up tour in Philadelphia on April 10, 2010. Julio G had replaced DJ Muggs for the tour. Muggs had been absent due to working on several other projects, including separate albums with B-Real and Sen Dog. The group was supposed to stop in Tucson, Arizona but canceled the show in protest of the recent immigration legislation. At the Rock en Seine festival in Paris on August 27, 2010 they said in an interview that they would wait and see what happens with the legislation before going back there.[8] Cypress Hill performed at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2010, on August 28 at Leeds and August 29 at Reading.On June 5, 2012, Cypress Hill and Dubstep artist Rusko released a collaborative EP entitled Cypress X Rusko. Also in 2012, Cypress Hill collaborated with Deadmau5 on his fourth studio album Album Title Goes Here, lending vocals on "Failbait".[9]One of the band's most striking aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals.[2] In the book Check the Technique B-Real describes his nasal style, saying his rapping voice is "high and annoying... the nasal style I have was just something that I developed... my more natural style wasn't so pleasing to [DJ Muggs and Sen Dog's] ears"[10] and talking about the nasal style in the book How to Rap, B-Real says, "you want to stand out from the others and just be distinct... when you got something that can separate you from everybody else, you gotta use it to your advantage."[1] Sen Dog's voice is deeper, more violent and often shouted alongside the rapping; his vocals are often emphasized by adding an additional background/choir voice to say them. Sen Dog's style is in contrast to B-Real's, who says, "[Sen's] voice is so strong", and "it all blends together" when they are both on the same track.[10]Both B-Real and Sen Dog started writing lyrics in both Spanish and English and B-Real was inspired to start writing raps from watching Sen Dog and Mellow Man Ace writing their lyrics,[10] and originally B-Real was going to just be the writer for the group rather than a rapper.[10] Their lyrics are noted for bringing a "cartoonish" approach to violence by Peter Shapiro and Allmusic.[2][11]The sound and groove of their music, produced by Muggs, is notable for its spooky sounds and stoned aesthetic; with its bass-heavy rhythms and odd sample loops ("Insane in the Brain" is notable for having a pitched-altered horse neigh looped in its chorus), it carries a psychedelic value, which lessened in the later albums.[2][11]The band is also known for involving rock instruments. In their songs  this has caused the band to sometimes be classified as a rap rock group.[2] The double album Skull & Bones consists of a pure rap album ("Skull") and an entire CD of rap/rock songs ("Bones"). Also in IV, there is "Lightning Strikes" which doesn't truly use electric guitars, but a synthesized version of it. In the live album Live at The Fillmore some of the old classics are played in a rock/metal version, with Sen Dog's band SX-10 and Eric Bobo playing the rock instrument.The band's music is constantly subject to change: while the first album and Black Sunday follow a more minimalistic and funky sound, III (Temples of Boom) has a very dark, spooky atmosphere and heavy beats, sometimes approaching hardcore rap. IV introduced more diverse sounds on the beats while maintaining the hardcore edge. The first albums are mostly influenced by psychedelic music, but the band eventually got closer to modern rap as it is today while still experimenting with rock from time to time, like on "Skull and Bones" and "Stoned Raiders".The band involves horns in their songs, and often have guitar and horns together in the instrumentals. "What's Your Number?", "Trouble", "Tequila Sunrise", and "(Rock) Superstar" have become some of the band's most popular songs featuring these elements.Eric Bobo is part of the group Sol Invicto with producer Richie Londres and Stephen Carpenter of the Deftones. Eric Bobo is also a main member of Cultura Londres Proyecto which is a Spanish Hip Hop group from London, England. In 2008, he released his first solo album "Meeting Of The Minds" on Nacional Records. In 2011, he joined up with Chilean DJ Latin Bitman to form the group Ritmo Machine & in November 2011 they released the album "Welcome To The Ritmo Machine" on Nacional Records with special guests Sick Jacken (Psycho Realm), Ana Tijoux, Sen-Dog, Mix Master Mike (Beastie Boys), P-Nut (311), Pato Machete & Chali 2na (Jurassic 5).2009 saw the releases of both B-Real and Sen Dog's solo efforts Smoke N Mirrors and Diary of a Mad Dog. B-Real is also part of a super-group called Serial Killaz with both Xzibit and his protg Young De. B-Real started his own production company called Audio Hustlaz, with which he has worked and featured on tracks with Kurupt, Young De, Xzibit, Adil Omar, Snoop Dogg, Bitza and others, and has also done guest appearances for La Coka Nostra, Ill Bill, Prozak, Akrobatik, The Outlawz, Nipsey Hussle and Apathy.Other notable side projects include B-Real's rap metal group Kush with members from Deftones and Fear Factory who are as yet to release any official material.Sen Dog has released one album with his rap metal group SX-10.Muggs has released collaborative albums with Sick Jacken, GZA, Planet Asia, Ill Bill and others.Smokeout Music Festival is an annual Southern California single day event, held in San Bernardino, California. The festival was founded and is still hosted by the members of the hip hop group Cypress Hill (Senen Reyes-aka-Sen Dog, Lawrence Muggerud-aka-DJ Muggs and Louis Freese-aka-B-Real). The concert has an array music types, including but not excluded to, hip hop, electronic dance music, dub step, and metalcore. Smokeout is pro-cannabis consumption and caters especially to medical marijuana patients. The first Smokeout was held in 1998, and the latest was on March 3, 2012. Smokeout 2012 was held in the NOS (National Orange Show) event center, and drew in a crowd of over 20,000 persons.[12]Grammy AwardsMTV Video Music Awards Awards1 History

Vincent John Martin (born 3 July 1960), better known by his stage name Vince Clarke, is an English synthpop musician and songwriter. Clarke has been a member of a number of groups, including Depeche Mode, Yazoo, The Assembly and Erasure. He is often credited as being the King of the Synthesizer.Martin was born in South Woodford, London and then he moved to Basildon, Essex. He initially studied the violin and then the piano.In the late-1970s, Martin and schoolmate Andy Fletcher formed the short-lived band No Romance in China. In 1979, he teamed up with Marlow & Gore to form French Look. Another band, named Composition of Sound, followed in 1980 with another addition of Martin Gore and also, Fletcher. Martin provided vocals until singer Dave Gahan joined the band, which was now renamed Depeche Mode. At that time, Martin adopted the stage-name Vince Clarke. The band initially adopted a slick synthesised electropop sound, which produced the album Speak and Spell and the Clarke-penned singles "Dreaming of Me", "New Life" and "Just Can't Get Enough" in 1981.Clarke left Depeche Mode shortly thereafter. There were many rumoured reasons pertaining to his departure. Clarke himself has stated that he did not enjoy the direction in which the band was going.[citation needed] He commented on Depeche Mode's later material as being a little dark for his taste, but good nonetheless. He also commented: "Martin was a strong writer. He always had been. And I think when I left, it gave him the chance just to sort of emerge as the songwriter. I mean, he could always write songs. It's not like he just started because I left".[this quote needs a citation] Clarke also stated that he didn't enjoy the public aspects of success, such as touring and interviews, and found himself frequently at odds with his bandmates, particularly on the tour bus.[1] He also stated: "I think everybody in the band, especially myself, imagined that the reason we were doing so well was because of themselves... We were pretty young and very lucky, and things had happened very quickly for us and I don't think we were really mature to handle the situation."[2] Depeche Mode went on to achieve international stardom.Clarke then teamed up with singer Alison Moyet (at the time known by the nickname of 'Alf') to form the popular synthpop band Yazoo (known as Yaz in the U.S.), which produced two albums and a string of hits including "Only You", "Don't Go", "Situation", "The Other Side of Love", "Nobody's Diary" and "Walk Away from Love".Yazoo split in 1983, and Moyet went on to have a successful solo career. Yazoo reformed in 2008 for a series of live dates to celebrate 25 years since the duo's split.In 1983 Clarke teamed up with Eric Radcliffe and it was their idea to collaborate as one-off associations with different artists on each new single, under the name The Assembly, notably with singer Feargal Sharkey they scored the Top5 hit "Never Never". In the meanwhile he founded the label Reset Records with Eric Radcliffe. During 1983 and further on in 1984, he produced four singles "The Face of Dorian Gray" "I Just Want to Dance", "Claudette" and "Calling All Destroyers" for his friend Robert Marlow, which were released on this label. They also produced an album, which was shelved but was released much later in 1999 under the name The Peter Pan Effect. In 1985, another collaboration took place with Paul Quinn of Bourgie Bourgie, the result was the single "One Day" by Vince Clarke & Paul Quinn. However, the project never took off, and Clarke moved on to other projects.[3]In early 1985, Clarke put an ad in Melody Maker for a singer, and one applicant was Andy Bell, who was a fan of his earlier projects. He teamed with Bell to form the group Erasure, and the duo became one of the major selling acts in British music with international hits like "Oh L'amour", "Sometimes", "Chains of Love", "A Little Respect", "Chorus", "Love to Hate You", "Take a Chance on Me" and "Always".The band has released 16 albums to date and have enjoyed a long string of hit singles spanning their more than two decades together, most recently topped-off by the 2005 top five hit "Breathe" taken from their Nightbird album. In 2006 Erasure produced a country-western style acoustic album consisting of mostly non-single cuts from their previous albums. This album, Union Street was preceded by the single "Boy" originally included on their 1997 Cowboy album.On 26 January 2007, in a video message on the official Erasure website,[4] the band announced the release of their sixteenth (thirteenth studio) album, entitled Light at the End of the World. Released in the UK on 21 May 2007, with a US release the following day, it was preceded by the single "I Could Fall in Love with You", released on 2 April 2007. The second single, "Sunday Girl" was subsequently released.The album was produced by Gareth Jones and was a more "dance oriented" effort than some of their more recent work with Clarke making reference to the new material sounding potentially a bit more like Andy Bell's 2005 solo effort Electric Blue.Erasure went on to tour with Cyndi Lauper, Deborah Harry, Margaret Cho and other artists, for the 2007 True Colors Tour of the United States, a tour which benefited gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender freedoms and rights. Erasure then went out on their own, headlining the "Light at the End of the World" tour in North America and Europe.The band released a new EP, Storm Chaser, in September2007. The EP contains nine tracks, one of them the winner of an online fan remix contest, for the track "When a Lover Leaves You", from the Light at the End of the World album.The most recent Erasure album, Tomorrow's World, was released in October 2011, featuring production by Frankmusik.In July 1984, Clarke teamed Stephen Luscombe of Blancmange, Pandit Dinesh and Asha Bhosle. The group, West India Company, released a four track, self-titled EP.Clarke worked with synthpop producer Martyn Ware (of Heaven 17 and The Human League) in 1999 as "The Clarke & Ware Experiment" and released the album Pretentious. The duo collaborated again in 2001 for the album Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle, which was created with "3D music technology" specifically designed for listening in headphones. 2001 also saw the release of the Clarke-produced album Erasure's Vince Clarke which featured The Peter Pan Effect, an album that he and Eric Radcliffe produced for his long-time friend, Robert Marlow. Clarke wrote "Let's Get Together" for the pop girl group Girl Authority for their second album, Road Trip. The song was originally meant to be for Depeche Mode, but was never recorded by them. Clarke also co-wrote "What Do I Want From You?" with Freeform Five, for their album Strangest Things (2005).Also in 2001, Clarke founded Illustrious Co. Ltd. with Martyn Ware, to create new forms of spatialised sound composition using their unique 3D AudioScape system, collaborating with fine artists, educational establishments, the performing arts, live events, corporate clients and educational settings round the world.[5]In 2004, Clarke provided additional music for an episode of Johnny Bravo entitled "The Time of My Life". This was a collaboration with Richard Butler (singer).Clarke was an essential component of a 2000 project called Family Fantastic.[6] They produced the album Nice!.[7] In 2007 Family Fantastic released a second album, entitled Wonderful.On 21 May 2009, Clarke was awarded by an "Outstanding Song Collection" prize, during the Ivor Novello Awards ceremony of the same day, in recognition of 30years in the music industry.Clarke was featured in the BBC Four documentary Synth Britannia.In 2012, Vince collaborated with the band The Good Natured on a track called "Ghost Train", available as a free download on their website, in exchange for a Tweet.Also in 2012, Vince produced a cover of the Depeche Mode song "Fly On The Windscreen" featuring Ane Brun.When Clarke started using synthesisers, they were predominantly analogue (digital synthesisers were rare, and would remain that way until the launch of the Yamaha DX7 in 1983[8]). In order to connect analogue synthesisers, analogue drum machines and analogue sequencers together, multiple CV/Gate cables were required between each device. This system was not standardised, so interoperability between instruments from different manufacturers was not always straightforward. In addition, some manufacturers used their own proprietary interfaces.[9] When an industry-wide standard called MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was introduced in 1983, Clarke, like most other electronic musicians, gradually migrated to the new technology. However, he continued to prefer his older analogue instruments:"... CV and Gate is tighter. I can hear and feel that it's tighter than MIDI  we can even prove it using 'scopes. Because everything is clocked simply, it arrives bang on the beat. The whole production starts to 'tick over'. Just look at Kraftwerk's stuff. I think that 'feel' has been lost with MIDI sequencers. No matter what you do with MIDI, the music will never sound as good as it did in the good old Futurist days. That's why our tracks sound the way they do."[10]For the Chorus album in 1991, he gathered together his collection of analogue synthesisers from various recording studio locations in London and set up a small studio in Amsterdam. This led Clarke to assemble an intricate patch system to more easily enable the control of his analogue instruments:"... the secret is having a good patch system  not as in patching to the mixing desk, but in patching CV and Gate. Because we don't use MIDI at all, you have to run three or four cables between each synth module  CV, Gate, Filter, Amplitude or whatever  and you've got to have a really unique system to do that."[10]In 1993 Clarke described his approach to songwriting:"Andy [Bell] and I get together with a guitar and a tape recorder, I'll strum some chords, he'll sing a melody and we work in little sections, four or eight bars long. Then we'll try stringing the sections together. It's like a jigsaw puzzle. I find it very hard to relate songwriting to synthesisers, actually  we write songs in a very traditional way. The electronic side of things is just to create the atmosphere. It's mostly just messing about..!
"Once we've worked out a song, I start programming up the arrangement on the BBC UMI sequencer, which lets me run 16 synths simultaneously. That way you get a better idea if parts are working together or not. Then we start refining the individual sounds. And finally the whole lot is transferred to my Roland MC4, piece by piece, so it's being run in CV and Gate. Once we've got that, it's a case of Andy sketching out vocal ideas  in the studio we use two 48 track digital tape machines, which gives Dinger 24 tracks just for his voice!"[10]Clarke continued to expand his collection of analogue synthesisers and in 1994 set up "37B", a recording studio built adjacent to his custom-made home, "Ammonite", in Chertsey, Surrey. From 1994 to 2003, all Erasure albums were either wholly or in part recorded at "37B".[11][12][13]In 2004 Clarke moved to Maine, USA. While waiting for his studio equipment to be shipped from the UK, he began using an Apple Mac laptop with Logic Pro, Max/MSP, and various software synthesisers (many of which were analogue emulations). Since then, he has continued to use Logic Pro, along with both software and analogue synthesisers:"Nowadays, you can take the best bits from digital and analogue. On certain projects  say, if I'm doing library music  where you need to have instant recall all the time, then it's obviously much more convenient to use the computer. When it comes to writing a new song, though, I still like to have the old analogue gear there, too. But, a lot of soft synths have a character of their own, too; the Moog Modular V is just crazy!
"I think that analogue has an inherent sound to it  it's like the old argument over vinyl versus CD. It seems that you hear more frequencies coming from an analogue synth than you do from a software synth, but the great thing about the latter is that you can do far more complex modulation, both within the synth itself and on the keyboard. To emulate any of those really complex modulations on an analogue... well, you'd need a mile of cable."[14]As of 2009, Clarke has installed his analogue synthesisers alongside his Logic Pro-based workstation in a custom-built commercial studio called "The Cabin" in Maine.[15][16][17]Current/recent studio equipment: Dave Smith Instruments Mopho, Roland System 700, Roland 100M, Roland Jupiter-8, Roland Jupiter-4, Roland MKS-80, Roland SH-1, Roland VP-330, Roland JP-8000, Roland Juno-60, Roland Juno-106, Roland Super JX, Roland D-550, ARP 2500 Modular, ARP 2600, PPG Wave 2.2, Waldorf Microwave, Waldorf Pulse, Moog Modular, Minimoog, Moog Source, E-Mu Modular System, Buchla 100 series Modular, Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, Sequential Circuits Pro-One, Oxford Synthesiser Company OSCar, Synton Syrinx, Korg MS-20, Korg MS-10, Korg 700, Korg M1, Korg DVP, Serge Modular, Polyfusion Modular, Oberheim Xpander, Oberheim SEM System, RSF Kobol, Electronic Music Studios VCS 3, Matten and Wiechers x2 48 track sequencers total 96 track., Sennheiser Vocoder VSM201, Apple iPad 2, Apple Power Mac G5, Apple MacBook Pro.[18][19]Current/recent software: Apple Logic Pro, Cycling '74 Max/MSP, Arturia ARP 2600 V, Arturia Minimoog V, Arturia Moog Modular V, GForce impOSCar, GForce Oddity, LinPlug Octopus, Muon Tau Pro, Native Instruments Absynth, Native Instruments Reaktor, Native Instruments FM7, Native Instruments FM8, Vienna Symphonic String & Choir Libraries.[19][20]Clarke has been married to Tracy Hurley since 2004. They have a son named Oscar and live together in the United States, in Maine. Tracy Hurley is the sister of the American writer Tonya Hurley whose husband, Michael Pagnotta, is the manager of Erasure. [21][22]Clarke is left-handed.Vince Clarke, ex-member of Depeche Mode collaborated with his former colleague Martin Gore for the first time since 1981 as techno duo VCMG on an instrumental minimalist electronic dance album called Ssss, released on 12 March 2012. The first EP entitled Spock was released worldwide exclusively on Beatport on 30 November 2011.[23] The second EP Single Blip was once again first released exclusively on Beatport on 20 February 2012.

Facebook is a social networking service launched in February 2004, owned and operated by Facebook, Inc.[5] As of September 2012[update], Facebook has over one billion active users,[6] more than half of them using Facebook on a mobile device.[7] Users must register before using the site, after which they may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, and exchange messages, including automatic notifications when they update their profile. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends".Facebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.[8] The website's membership was initially limited by the founders to Harvard students, but was expanded to other colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities before opening to high school students, and eventually to anyone aged 13 and over. However, according to a May 2011 Consumer Reports survey, there are 7.5 million children under 13 with accounts and 5 million under 10, violating the site's terms of service.[9]A January 2009 Compete.com study ranked Facebook as the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users.[10] Entertainment Weekly included the site on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember our co-workers' birthdays, bug our friends, and play a rousing game of Scrabulous before Facebook?"[11] Critics, such as Facebook Detox,[12] state that Facebook has turned into a national obsession in the United States, resulting in vast amounts of time lost and encouraging narcissism. Quantcast estimates Facebook has 138.9 million monthly unique U.S. visitors in May 2011.[13] According to Social Media Today, in April 2010 an estimated 41.6% of the U.S. population had a Facebook account.[14] Nevertheless, Facebook's market growth started to stall in some regions, with the site losing 7 million active users in the United States and Canada in May 2011.[15]The name of the service stems from the colloquial name for the book given to students at the start of the academic year by some university administrations in the United States to help students get to know each other. Facebook allows any users who declare themselves to be at least 13 years old to become registered users of the site.[16]Mark Zuckerberg wrote Facemash, the predecessor to Facebook, on October 28, 2003, while attending Harvard as a sophomore. According to The Harvard Crimson, the site was comparable to Hot or Not, and "used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person"[17][18]To accomplish this, Zuckerberg hacked into the protected areas of Harvard's computer network and copied the houses' private dormitory ID images. Harvard at that time did not have a student "facebook" (a directory with photos and basic information), though individual houses had been issuing their own paper facebooks since the mid-1980s. Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.[17][19]The site was quickly forwarded to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. Zuckerberg was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating copyrights, and violating individual privacy, and faced expulsion. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.[20] Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an art history final, by uploading 500 Augustan images to a website, with one image per page along with a comment section.[19] He opened the site up to his classmates, and people started sharing their notes.The following semester, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website in January 2004. He was inspired, he said, by an editorial in The Harvard Crimson about the Facemash incident.[21] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com.[22]Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.[23] The three complained to the Harvard Crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation. The three later filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg, subsequently settling.[24]Membership was initially restricted to students of Harvard College, and within the first month, more than half the undergraduate population at Harvard was registered on the service.[25] Eduardo Saverin (business aspects), Dustin Moskovitz (programmer), Andrew McCollum (graphic artist), and Chris Hughes soon joined Zuckerberg to help promote the website. In March 2004, Facebook expanded to Stanford, Columbia, and Yale.[26] It soon opened to the other Ivy League schools, Boston University, New York University, MIT, and gradually most universities in Canada and the United States.[27][28]Facebook was incorporated in mid-2004, and the entrepreneur Sean Parker, who had been informally advising Zuckerberg, became the company's president.[29] In June 2004, Facebook moved its base of operations to Palo Alto, California.[26] It received its first investment later that month from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel.[30] The company dropped The from its name after purchasing the domain name facebook.com in 2005 for $200,000.[31]Facebook launched a high-school version in September 2005, which Zuckerberg called the next logical step.[42] At that time, high-school networks required an invitation to join.[43] Facebook later expanded membership eligibility to employees of several companies, including Apple Inc. and Microsoft.[44] Facebook was then opened on September 26, 2006, to everyone of age 13 and older with a valid email address.[45][46]On October 24, 2007, Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15billion.[47] Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international ads on Facebook.[48] In October 2008, Facebook announced that it would set up its international headquarters in Dublin, Ireland.[49] In September 2009, Facebook said that it had turned cash-flow positive for the first time.[50] In November 2010, based on SecondMarket Inc., an exchange for shares of privately held companies, Facebook's value was $41billion (slightly surpassing eBay's) and it became the third largest U.S. Web company after Google and Amazon.[51]Traffic to Facebook increased steadily after 2009. More people visited Facebook than Google for the week ending March 13, 2010.[52]In March 2011 it was reported that Facebook removes approximately 20,000 profiles from the site every day for various infractions, including spam, inappropriate content and underage use, as part of its efforts to boost cyber security.[53]In early 2011, Facebook announced plans to move to its new headquarters, the former Sun Microsystems campus in Menlo Park, California.[54][55]Release of statistics by DoubleClick showed that Facebook reached one trillion pageviews in the month of June 2011, making it the most visited website in the world.[56] It should, however, be noted that Google and some of its selected websites are not counted in the DoubleClick rankings.According to the Nielsen Media Research study, released in December 2011, Facebook is the second most accessed website in the US.[57]In March 2012, Facebook announced App Center, an online mobile store which sells applications that connect to Facebook. The store will be available to iPhone, Android and mobile web users.[58]Facebook, Inc. held an initial public offering on May 17, 2012, negotiating a share price of $38 apiece, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly listed public company.[59]On July 2012, Facebook added a gay marriage icon to its timeline feature.[60]On August 23rd, 2012 Facebook released the much anticipated update to its iOS app, version 5.0. The app, which did not receive positive sentiments from its users, was rebuilt from the ground up; the app no longer uses page views which made it slow in the past but now utilizes code that uses native elements of iOS.[61]Users can create profiles with photos, lists of personal interests, contact information, and other personal information. Users can communicate with friends and other users through private or public messages and a chat feature. They can also create and join interest groups and "like pages" (called "fan pages" until April 19, 2010), some of which are maintained by organizations as a means of advertising.[62] Facebook has been prompted to add a "third gender", "other", or "intersex" tab in the gender option which contains only male and female.[63] Facebook refused and said that individuals can "opt out of showing their sex on their profile".[64] A 2012 Pew Internet and American Life study identified that between 2030% of Facebook users are "power users" who frequently link, poke, post and tag themselves and others.[65]To allay concerns about privacy, Facebook enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile.[66] The website is free to users, and generates revenue from advertising, such as banner ads.[67] Facebook requires a user's name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone. Users can control who sees other information they have shared, as well as who can find them in searches, through their privacy settings.[68]The media often compares Facebook to MySpace, but one significant difference between the two Web sites is the level of customization.[69] Another difference is Facebook's requirement that users give their true identity, a demand that MySpace does not make.[70] MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), while Facebook allows only plain text.[71] Facebook has a number of features with which users may interact. They include the Wall, a space on every user's profile page that allows friends to post messages for the user to see;[72] Pokes, which allows users to send a virtual "poke" to each other (a notification then tells a user that they have been poked);[73] Photos, where users can upload albums and photos;[74] and Status, which allows users to inform their friends of their whereabouts and actions.[75] Depending on privacy settings, anyone who can see a user's profile can also view that user's Wall. In July 2007, Facebook began allowing users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas the Wall was previously limited to textual content only.[72]On September 6, 2006, a News Feed was announced, which appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays of the user's friends.[76] This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause.[77] Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users).[78]In response, Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Since then, users have been able to control what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts, and newly added friends.[79]On February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent[80] on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user.[81] The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent, which may potentially include websites such as Twitter.[82]One of the most popular applications on Facebook is the Photos application, where users can upload albums and photos.[83] Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other image hosting services such as Photobucket and Flickr, which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200photos per album.[84][85][86][87]Privacy settings can be set for individual albums, limiting the groups of users that can see an album. For example, the privacy of an album can be set so that only the user's friends can see the album, while the privacy of another album can be set so that all Facebook users can see it. Another feature of the Photos application is the ability to "tag", or label, users in a photo. For instance, if a photo contains a user's friend, then the user can tag the friend in the photo. This sends a notification to the friend that they have been tagged, and provides them a link to see the photo.[88] On 7 June 2012, Facebook launched its App Center to its users. It will help the users in finding games and other applications with ease.[89] Since the launch of the App Center, Facebook has seen 150M monthly users with 2.4 times the installation of apps. [90]Facebook Notes was introduced on August 22, 2006, a blogging feature that allowed tags and embeddable images. Users were later able to import blogs from Xanga, LiveJournal, Blogger, and other blogging services.[45] During the week of April 7, 2008, Facebook released a Comet-based[91] instant messaging application called "Chat" to several networks,[92] which allows users to communicate with friends and is similar in functionality to desktop-based instant messengers.Facebook launched Gifts on February 8, 2007, which allows users to send virtual gifts to their friends that appear on the recipient's profile. Gifts cost $1.00 each to purchase, and a personalized message can be attached to each gift.[93][94] On May 14, 2007, Facebook launched Marketplace, which lets users post free classified ads.[95] Marketplace has been compared to Craigslist by CNET, which points out that the major difference between the two is that listings posted by a user on Marketplace are seen only by users in the same network as that user, whereas listings posted on Craigslist can be seen by anyone.[96]On July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced "Facebook Beta", a significant redesign of its user interface on selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a "cleaner" look.[97] After initially giving users a choice to switch, Facebook began migrating all users to the new version starting in September 2008.[98] On December 11, 2008, it was announced that Facebook was testing a simpler signup process.[99]On June 13, 2009, Facebook introduced a "Usernames" feature, whereby pages can be linked with simpler URLs such as http://www.facebook.com/facebook instead of http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=20531316728.[100] Many new smartphones offer access to Facebook services through either their Web browsers or applications. An official Facebook application is available for the operating systems Android, iOS, and webOS. Nokia and Research In Motion both provide Facebook applications for their own mobile devices. More than 425 million active users access Facebook through mobile devices across 200 mobile operators in 60 countries.[101]On November 15, 2010, Facebook announced a new "Facebook Messages" service. In a media event that day, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, "It's true that people will be able to have an @facebook.com email addresses, but it's not email". The launch of such a feature had been anticipated for some time before the announcement, with some calling it a "Gmail killer". The system, to be available to all of the website's users, combines text messaging, instant messaging, emails, and regular messages, and will include privacy settings similar to those of other Facebook services. Codenamed "Project Titan", Facebook Messages took 15 months to develop.[102][103]In February 2011, Facebook began to use the hCalendar microformat to mark up events, and the hCard microformat for the events' venues, enabling the extraction of details to users' own calendar or mapping applications.[104]Since April 2011 Facebook users have had the ability to make live voice calls via Facebook Chat, allowing users to chat with others from all over the world. This feature, which is provided free through T-Mobile's new Bobsled service, lets the user add voice to the current Facebook Chat as well as leave voice messages on Facebook.[105]On July 6, 2011, Facebook launched its video calling services using Skype as its technology partner. It allows one to one calling using a Skype Rest API.On September 14, 2011, Facebook launched a Subscribe button. The feature allows for users to follow public updates, and these are the people most often broadcasting their ideas.[106] There were major modifications that the site released on September 22, 2011.[107]As reported by TechCrunch on February 15, 2012, Facebook is introducing Verified Account concept like that of Twitter & Google+. Though as of March 3, 2012, verified accounts dont get any badges or denotations, but such accounts will get more priority in Subscription Suggestions of Facebook.[108]On March 6, 2012, Facebook officially launched Messenger for Windows, which gives users of Windows 7 access to some Facebook services without using a web browser.[109]According to comScore, an internet marketing research company, Facebook collects as much data from its visitors as Google and Microsoft, but considerably less than Yahoo!.[110] In 2010, the security team began expanding its efforts to reduce the risks to users' privacy,[111] but privacy concerns remain. On November 6, 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Beacon, which was an ultimately failed attempt to advertise to friends of users using the knowledge of what purchases friends made. As of March 2012, Facebook's usage of its user data is under close scrutiny.[112]On November 29, 2011, Facebook agreed to settle US Federal Trade Commission charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises.[113]Facebook is built in PHP which is compiled with HipHop for PHP, a source code transformer built by Facebook engineers that turns PHP into C++. The deployment of HipHop reportedly reduced average CPU consumption on Facebook servers by 50%.[114]Facebook is developed as one monolithic application. According to an interview in 2012 with Chuck Rossi, a build engineer at Facebook, Facebook compiles into a 1.5GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom BitTorrent-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes approximately 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process is zero downtime and new changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.[114]Facebook used a combination platform based on Hbase to stores data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, new events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them into storage. The User Interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as AJAX behavior. These requests are written to a log file using Scribe (developed by Facebook).[115]Data is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out (thus the name). Ptail data is separated out into three streams so they can eventually be sent to their own clusters in different data centers (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the amount of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article will generate a lot of impressions and news feed impressions which will cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a hashtable.[115]After this, data is output in PHP format (compiled with HipHop for PHP). The backend is written in Java and Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions are used to make the web pages display more quickly. The more and longer data is cached the less realtime it is. The data is then sent to MapReduce servers so it can be queried via Hive. This also serves as a backup plan as the data can be recovered from Hive. Raw logs are removed after a period of time.[115]The Like button is one of Facebook's social plug-ins. It was launched on April 21, 2010.[116][117]According to comScore, Facebook is the leading social networking site based on monthly unique visitors, having overtaken main competitor MySpace in April 2008.[119] ComScore reports that Facebook attracted 130million unique visitors in May 2010, an increase of 8.6million people.[120] According to Alexa, the website's ranking among all websites increased from 60th to 7th in worldwide traffic, from September 2006 to September 2007, and is currently 1st.[121] Quantcast ranks the website 2nd in the U.S. in traffic,[122] and Compete.com ranks it 2nd in the U.S.[123] The website is the most popular for uploading photos, with 50billion uploaded cumulatively.[124] In 2010, Sophos's "Security Threat Report 2010" polled over 500 firms, 60% of which responded that they believed that Facebook was the social network that posed the biggest threat to security, well ahead of MySpace, Twitter, and LinkedIn.[111]Facebook is the most popular social networking site in several English-speaking countries, including Canada,[125] the United Kingdom,[126] and the United States.[127][128][129][130] In regional Internet markets, Facebook penetration is highest in North America (69 percent), followed by Middle East-Africa (67 percent), Latin America (58 percent), Europe (57 percent), and Asia-Pacific (17 percent).[131] Some of the top competitors were listed in 2007 by Mashable.[132]The website has won awards such as placement into the "Top 100 Classic Websites" by PC Magazine in 2007,[133] and winning the "People's Voice Award" from the Webby Awards in 2008.[134] In a 2006 study conducted by Student Monitor, a New Jersey-based company specializing in research concerning the college student market, Facebook was named the second most popular thing among undergraduates, tied with beer and only ranked lower than the iPod.[135]On March 2010, Judge Richard Seeborg issued an order approving the class settlement in Lane v. Facebook, Inc., the class action lawsuit arising out of Facebook's Beacon program.In 2010, Facebook won the Crunchie "Best Overall Startup Or Product" for the third year in a row[136] and was recognized as one of the "Hottest Silicon Valley Companies" by Lead411.[137] However, in a July 2010 survey performed by the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Facebook received a score of 64 out of 100, placing it in the bottom 5% of all private-sector companies in terms of customer satisfaction, alongside industries such as the IRS e-file system, airlines, and cable companies. The reasons why Facebook scored so poorly include privacy problems, frequent changes to the website's interface, the results returned by the News Feed, and spam.[138]In December 2008, the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory ruled that Facebook is a valid protocol to serve court notices to defendants. It is believed to be the world's first legal judgement that defines a summons posted on Facebook as legally binding.[139] In March 2009, the New Zealand High Court associate justice David Gendall allowed for the serving of legal papers on Craig Axe by the company Axe Market Garden via Facebook.[140][141] Employers (such as Virgin Atlantic Airways) have also used Facebook as a means to keep tabs on their employees and have even been known to fire them over posts they have made.[142]By 2005, the use of Facebook had already become so ubiquitous that the generic verb "facebooking" had come into use to describe the process of browsing others' profiles or updating one's own.[143] In 2008, Collins English Dictionary declared "Facebook" as its new Word of the Year.[144] In December 2009, the New Oxford American Dictionary declared its word of the year to be the verb "unfriend", defined as "To remove someone as a 'friend' on a social networking site such as Facebook. As in, 'I decided to unfriend my roommate on Facebook after we had a fight.'"[145]In early 2010, Openbook was established, an avowed parody (and privacy advocacy) website[146] that enables text-based searches of those Wall posts that are available to "Everyone", i.e. to everyone on the Internet.Writers for The Wall Street Journal found in 2010 that Facebook apps were transmitting identifying information to "dozens of advertising and Internet tracking companies". The apps used an HTTP referrer which exposed the user's identity and sometimes their friends'. Facebook said, "We have taken immediate action to disable all applications that violate our terms".[147]In October 2012, the countries with the most Facebook users were:[148]All of the above total 309 million members or about 38.6 percent of Facebook's 1 billion worldwide members.[149]Facebook has met with controversies. It has been blocked intermittently in several countries including the People's Republic of China,[150] Iran,[151] Uzbekistan,[152] Pakistan,[153] Syria (unblocked in Syria [154] ),[155] and Bangladesh on different bases. For example, it was banned in many countries of the world on the basis of allowed content judged as anti-Islamic and containing religious discrimination. It has also been banned at many workplaces to prevent employees from using it during work hours.[156] The privacy of Facebook users has also been an issue, and the safety of user accounts has been compromised several times. Facebook has settled a lawsuit regarding claims over source code and intellectual property.[157] In May 2011 emails were sent to journalists and bloggers making critical allegations about Google's privacy policies; however it was later discovered that the anti-Google campaign, conducted by PR giant Burson-Marsteller, was paid for by Facebook in what CNN referred to as "a new level skullduggery" and which Daily Beast called a "clumsy smear".[158]In July 2011, German authorities began to discuss the prohibition of events organized on Facebook. The decision is based on several cases of overcrowding by people not originally invited.[159][160] In one instance, 1,600 "guests" attended the 16th birthday party for a Hamburg girl who accidentally posted the invitation for the event as public. After reports of overcrowding, more than a hundred police were deployed for crowd control. A policeman was injured and eleven participants were arrested for assault, property damage and resistance to authorities.[161] In another unexpectedly overcrowded event, 41 young people were arrested and at least 16 injured.[162]In 2007, it was reported that 43% of British office workers were blocked from accessing Facebook at work, due to concerns including reduced productivity and the potential for industrial espionage.[163]A 2011 study in the online journal First Monday, "Why Parents Help Their Children Lie to Facebook About Age: Unintended Consequences of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act," examines how parents consistently enable children as young as 10 years old to sign up for accounts, directly violating Facebook's policy banning young visitors. This policy technically allows Facebook to avoid conflicts with the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), requiring that minors aged 13 or younger gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites. Of the more than 1,000 households surveyed for the study, more than three-quarters (76%) of parents reported that their child joined Facebook when she was younger than 13, the minimum age in the site's terms of service. The study notes that, in response to widespread reports of underage users, a Facebook executive has said that "Facebook removes 20,000 people a day, people who are underage." The study's authors also note, "Indeed, Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join." The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of federal law, but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors. Only 53% of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age; 35% of these parents believe that the minimum age is a site recommendation (not a condition of site use), or thought the signup age was 16 or 18, and not 13.[164]In November 2011, several Facebook users reported that their accounts were hacked and their profile pictures were replaced with pornographic images. For more than a week, users' news feeds were spammed with pornographic, violent and sexual contents. It has been reported that more than 200,000 accounts in Bangalore, India were hacked. Facebook has denied the claims, citing that "safety of the users was on the top of their priority list".[165][166]There has been much user discontent over Facebook's mandatory changeover to the new Timeline profile. Some Facebook users reported discontent with having many Facebook status updates and photos from the past easily visible.[167][168]According to a leading counter terrorism expert, terrorists are using Facebook for hiring loners from western nations like Australia.[169]In November 2012 several tech writers and bloggers reacted negatively to Facebook's new couples page feature, which automatically created new joint profile pages for people with a relationship listed on the site.[170]In April 2011, Facebook launched a new portal for marketers and creative agencies to help them develop brand promotions on Facebook.[171] The company began its push by inviting a select group of British advertising leaders to meet Facebook's top executives at an "influencers' summit" in February 2010. Facebook has now been involved in campaigns for True Blood, American Idol, and Top Gear.[172] News and media outlets such as the Washington Post,[173] Financial Times[174] and ABC News[175] have used aggregated Facebook fan data to create various infographics and charts to accompany their articles.Facebook has affected the social life and activity of people in various ways. With its availability on many mobile devices, Facebook allows users to continuously stay in touch with friends, relatives and other acquaintances wherever they are in the world, as long as there is access to the Internet. It can also unite people with common interests and/or beliefs through groups and other pages, and has been known to reunite lost family members and friends because of the widespread reach of its network. One such reunion was between John Watson and the daughter he had been seeking for 20 years. They met after Watson found her Facebook profile.[176] Another father-daughter reunion was between Tony Macnauton and Frances Simpson, who had not seen each other for nearly 48 years.[177]Some argue that Facebook is beneficial to one's social life because they can continuously stay in contact with their friends and relatives, while others say that it can cause increased antisocial tendencies because people are not directly communicating with each other. Some studies have named Facebook as a source of problems in relationships. Several news stories have suggested that using Facebook can lead to higher instances of divorce and infidelity, but the claims have been questioned by other commentators.[178][179]Facebook's role in the American political process was demonstrated in January 2008, shortly before the New Hampshire primary, when Facebook teamed up with ABC and Saint Anselm College to allow users to give live feedback about the "back to back" January 5 Republican and Democratic debates.[180][181][182] Charles Gibson moderated both debates, held at the Dana Center for the Humanities at Saint Anselm College. Facebook users took part in debate groups organized around specific topics, register to vote, and message questions.[183]ABCNews.com reported in 2012 that the Facebook fanbases of political candidates have relevance for the election campaign, including:Unless you get out of Facebook and into someones face, you really have not acted.Over a million people installed the Facebook application "US Politics on Facebook" in order to take part, and the application measured users' responses to specific comments made by the debating candidates.[185] This debate showed the broader community what many young students had already experienced: Facebook as a popular and powerful new way to interact and voice opinions. An article by Michelle Sullivan of Uwire.com illustrates how the "Facebook effect" has affected youth voting rates, support by youth of political candidates, and general involvement by the youth population in the 2008 election.[186]In February 2008, a Facebook group called "One Million Voices Against FARC" organized an event in which hundreds of thousands of Colombians marched in protest against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as the FARC (from the group's Spanish name).[187] In August 2010, one of North Korea's official government websites and the official news agency of the country, Uriminzokkiri, joined Facebook.[188]In 2011 there was a controversial ruling by French government to uphold a 1992 decree which stipulates that commercial enterprises should not be promoted on news programs. President Nicolas Sarkozy's colleagues have agreed that it will enforce a law so that the word "Facebook" will not be allowed to be spoken on the television or on the radio.[189]In 2011, Facebook filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to form a political action committee under the name FB PAC.[190] In an email to The Hill, a spokesman for Facebook said "FB PAC will give our employees a way to make their voice heard in the political process by supporting candidates who share our goals of promoting the value of innovation to our economy while giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected."[191]Mark ZuckerbergEduardo SaverinAndrew McCollumDustin MoskovitzChris Hughes1 History2 Website

Kris Drever (born in Orkney, Scotland[1]) is a Scottish contemporary folk musician and songwriter, who came to prominence in 2006 with the release of his debut solo album, Black Water. Drever also plays in the folk trio Lau alongside Martin Green and Aidan O'Rourke, and has worked with numerous other British folk contemporaries including Kate Rusby, John McCusker, Eddi Reader and Julie Fowlis.Drever grew up in the Orkney Islands where he learned to play guitar and participated in the island's folk festival. In 1995 at age 17 he moved to Edinburgh where he played at the Tron Ceilidh House several nights a week. He played the double bass for a time but returned to the guitar where his style - "a highly individual blend of rhythm and harmony, folk, jazz, rock and country inflections"[1] - made him a sought after session musician.[1]In late 2000 he began playing alongside Nuala Kennedy and Anna-Wendy Stevenson in a weekly session at Sandy Bell's pub in Edinburgh. The trio became known as Fine Friday which toured in the UK, Europe and Australia and released two albums before disbanding. Drever went on to collaborate with a number of prominent folk musicians including: Cathy Ryan of Irish-American supergroup Cherish the Ladies; Scottish fiddlers John McCusker and Bruce MacGregor; Irish accordionist Leo McCann; Gaelic band Tannas; and the Irish dance show Celtic Fusion.[1] Drever is also a founding member of the folk collective Session A9, has been a member of Kate Rusby's band and has worked with contemporary folk artists Eddi Reader and Julie Fowlis.[2]In 2005 Drever formed the trio Lau along with Scottish fiddler Aidan O'Rourke and English accordionist Martin Green. The band has released two studio albums and conducted numerous tours throughout the UK and worldwide. His most recent collaboration has been with Roddy Woomble, lead singer of Scottish indie band Idlewild, and John McCusker. The trio worked, along with other notable folk musicians, on an album entitled Before the Ruin which was released in September 2008.[1][2]Before the release of Black Water, Drever had not considered a solo career. In an interview with Mojo, Drever states[citation needed]:A live DVD was released July 28, 2008, featuring Drever's "Classic Album" set at 2008's Celtic Connections.In January 2010, Drever released his second solo album, Mark the Hard Earth during Celtic Connections.[3] Drever launched the album with a concert at the Old Fruitmarket on January 29, alongside his former band, Session A9.Kris is the son of Ivan Drever, a former member of Wolfstone[4], and a cousin of game developer and drummer Terry Drever.1 Career2 Personal life3 Discography

Sophie Michelle Ellis-Bextor (born 10 April 1979) is an English singer, songwriter, model and occasional DJ. She first came to prominence in the late 1990s, as the lead singer of the indie rock band Theaudience. After the group disbanded, Ellis-Bextor went solo, achieving widespread success in the early 2000s. Her music is a mixture of mainstream pop, disco, nu-disco, and 1980s electronic influences.Her solo debut album, Read My Lips, was released in September 2001. The album reached number two on the UK albums chart and was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).[1][2] The record experienced international success, selling more than 2 million copies worldwide.[3] It produced four singles, three of which reached the top three in the UK.[1] In 2003, Read My Lips won the Edison Award for "Best Dance Album".[4] Ellis-Bextor's second album, Shoot from the Hip, was released in October 2003. The album reached number nineteen in the UK and produced two top ten singles.[1] Trip the Light Fantastic, her third album, was released in May 2007 and reached number seven in the UK.[1] The album produced three singles, one of which reached the top ten in the UK.[1]In 2009, Ellis-Bextor released the Freemasons collaboration "Heartbreak (Make Me a Dancer)" and her first extended play, Sophie Ellis-Bextor: iTunes Live in London. Her fourth studio album, Make a Scene, was released in April 2011 and was a Top 20 success in Russia where it reached No.12 and was certified Gold status.Ellis-Bextor was born in London on 10 April 1979, the daughter of Robin Bextor and former Blue Peter presenter Janet Ellis who separated when she was four.[5] As a young girl, she appeared on several Blue Peter items, with no indication given on-screen that she was Ellis's daughter.She attended St. Stephen's School and later Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith. Among her earliest public performances were with the W11 Opera children's opera from the age of thirteen, and she is now a patron of the organisation.[6]Ellis-Bextor appeared with her mother Janet Ellis along in a children's DVD compilation songs video entitled 'a day full of songs' which was released by retailer Marks & Spencer. She began her musical career in 1997, with an indie band called Theaudience. Ellis-Bextor sang the lead vocal in the band. While she was a band member, readers of Melody Maker elected her to the number-one position among the 'most sexy people in rock'. She recorded a duet with Manic Street Preachers"Black Holes for the Young"as a B-side for their 1998 single "The Everlasting". Several songs released by Theaudience are "I Got the Wherewithal", "If You Can't Do It When You're Young; When Can You Do It?", "I Know Enough (I Don't Get Enough)", and "A Pessimist Is Never Disappointed" (perhaps their best-known single). The band split in December 1998. In 1999, Ellis-Bextor made an appearance on the Departure Lounge album Out of Here.After Theaudience split, Ellis-Bextor took a year off from singing. In 2000, Ellis-Bextor collaborated with Italian DJ Spiller on adding vocals to his then-instrumental club track "Groovejet", her first recorded work since that with Theaudience. "Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)" entered the UK charts at number one, just beating former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham on her first solo outing to the top spot. Since then, the two have been described as rivals. Both women deny, however, that there is any rivalry between the two of them. "Groovejet" won several awards: No.1, Pop Top20; No.1, ILR; No.1, Radio1; No.8, top dance track of 2000 and single of the year in Melody Maker. In the Metro Newspaper, it received ninth place in the contest for the Greatest No.1 of all time.[7] In 2000, it was a finalist in The Record of the Year. In that same year, it won the awards for Best Single and Best Ibiza Tune at the Ericsson Muzik Awards.[8]In 2001, Ellis-Bextor released her debut album, Read My Lips. It reached number two on the UK charts and spawned four top-twenty hit singles. Her rework of Cher's "Take Me Home" reached number two, as did "Murder on the Dancefloor", which became Ellis-Bextor's biggest single and was on charts for twenty-three weeks.[9] "Murder on the Dancefloor" became Europe's most played song of 2002. In 2002, Read My Lips was re-released with two new songs (and a live version of "Groovejet") and Ellis-Bextor won the Recording Artist Award at that year's Showbusiness Awards. Her third single, "Get Over You"/"Move This Mountain", was released in June 2002 and reached number three. The fourth single, "Music Gets the Best of Me", rose to number fourteen in December. At the beginning of 2002, Ellis-Bextor was nominated for the "British Female Solo Artist" BRIT Award, going on to be nominated for a further two consecutive years.[10][11][12]Her second album, Shoot from the Hip, was released in October 2003. Although it was not as commercially successful as her previous material, it held two further top-ten singles. The album reached no higher than number fourteen on the UK charts; its two singles were "Mixed Up World", which reached number seven, and "I Won't Change You", reaching number nine. Around this time, rivalry against Victoria Beckham was suggested again; Beckham's single "This Groove"/"Let Your Head Go" reached number three, a higher position in the charts than "I Won't Change You". During this time Ellis-Bextor became pregnant and plans for a third and fourth single from the album, as well as the Shoot from the Hip Tour, were scrapped. After that, Ellis-Bextor took a break from her musical career to take care of her first child.In early 2005, she performed on a track by the duo Busface, entitled "Circles (Just My Good Time)"; she was credited as "Mademoiselle E.B." to not have this be mistaken for a single from her next album.In 2006, her track "Dear Jimmy" was released on the Popjustice compilation album 100% Solid Pop Music.Her third album, Trip the Light Fantastic, was released in May 2007 and debuted at number seven on the UK Albums Chart. Fred Schneider of The B-52s, Richard Barone (formerly of The Bongos), Shelly Poole (formerly of Alisha's Attic), Cathy Dennis and Kerin Smith (formerly of Theaudience) contributed to produce an album of disco-pop music. Before the album, two singles were released: "Catch You", which charted in the UK at number eight, and "Me and My Imagination (number twenty-three). Trip the Light Fantastic was certified Gold in July 2008, for selling 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.[13] The third single, "Today the Sun's on Us", debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number sixty-four.Ellis-Bextor supported George Michael on his UK tour leg in June 2007. Her own UK tour, the Trip the Light Fantastic Tour, was due to start in August 2007, but it was postponed after Ellis-Bextor was invited to be the "special guest" on Take That's Beautiful World Tour, which commenced in October 2007.[14] Ellis-Bextor stated that her tour would be re-scheduled for March 2008, with all tickets purchased being valid for the rescheduled concerts. The tour was never re-scheduled, and Ellis-Bextor subsequently refused to discuss the issue in interviews.[15] In September 2007, Ellis-Bextor took part in Sopot Festival 2007 in Poland, representing the UK.The song "If I Can't Dance" was announced as a single but later retracted,[14][16] as was "Love Is Here"; Ellis-Bextor was supposed to release a single in late November to promote a greatest hits album, but the release date was pushed back to March 2008, and subsequently cancelled. However, "If I Can't Dance" has appeared on several compilations in Spain such as Supermodelo 2008 CD and Disco Estrella 2008.According to Ellis-Bextor in April 2008, recording sessions for her scrapped greatest hits collection proved fruitful, so she decided to release a fourth studio album.[citation needed] In October 2008, Ellis-Bextor covered the Dolly Parton song "Jolene"; the track was released on the soundtrack to the BBC2 sitcom Beautiful People. In early November 2008, Ellis-Bextor recorded a track with the French DJ Junior Caldera, "Can't Fight This Feeling", for his 2009 album Dbut. Released as a single in February 2010, it reached the top twenty in France.In November 2008, Ellis-Bextor confirmed her next single would be "Sophia Loren", which was used in a Rimmel ad campaign in which she also starred, but a single release never materialised.[citation needed] In August 2009, she released a five-track live EP from the 2009 iTunes Festival, during which she performed previous singles of hers and a new track, "Starlight" (not included on the EP). Freemasons worked with Ellis-Bextor for their album Shakedown 2 on "Heartbreak (Make Me a Dancer)", which was released as a single in June 2009 and peaked at number thirteen in the UK. Ellis-Bextor performed at Birmingham's Nightingale Club in January 2010.Ellis-Bextor's fourth album, Make a Scene, was released in June 2011.[17] She described it as "very much [a dance album]more so than any of my other albums. What I'm planning next though is an album that's really different. I think I need to do something different now and move on from the dance stuff. I might come back to it, but I think this album is a good way to bow out of the dance sound for now. I think it's finishing on a high."[18] She worked with Calvin Harris, Armin van Buuren,[19] Richard X, Dimitri Tikovoi, Hannah Robinson, Metronomy,[20] and Liam Howe from the Sneaker Pimps. The first single from the album, "Bittersweet" (co-written by Freemasons and Hannah Robinson[21]), was released in May 2010 and reached number twenty-five on the UK Singles Chart. "Not Giving Up on Love" was released as the second single from the album, in August 2010 in Europe,[22] followed by "Starlight" as the third single in May 2011.

Heat World Interview (2009)

A record producer is an individual working within the music industry, whose job is to oversee and manage the recording (i.e. "production") of an artist's music. A producer has many roles that may include, but are not limited to, gathering ideas for the project, selecting songs and/or musicians, coaching the artist and musicians in the studio, controlling the recording sessions, and supervising the entire process through mixing and mastering. Producers also often take on a wider entrepreneurial role, with responsibility for the budget, schedules, and negotiations.Today, the recording industry has two kinds of producers: executive producer and music producer; they have different roles. While an executive producer oversees a project's finances, a music producer oversees the creation of the music.A music producer can, in some cases, be compared to a film director, with noted practitioner Phil Ek himself describing his role as "the person who creatively guides or directs the process of making a record, like a director would a movie. The engineer would be more the cameraman of the movie."[1] The music producer's job is to create, shape, and mold a piece of music. The scope of responsibility may be one or two songs or an artist's entire album in which case the producer will typically develop an overall vision for the album and how the various songs may interrelate.In the US, before the rise of the record producer, someone from A&R would oversee the recording session(s), assuming responsibility for creative decisions relating to the recording.With today's relatively easy access to technology, an alternative to the record producer just mentioned, is the so-called 'bedroom producer'. With today's technological advances, it is very easy for a producer to achieve high quality tracks without the use of a single instrument; that happens in urban music (like hip hop, rap, etc.). Many established artists take this approach.In most cases the music producer is also a competent arranger, composer, musician or songwriter who can bring fresh ideas to a project. As well as making any songwriting and arrangement adjustments, the producer is also in charge of the creative mix. He or she will liaise with the sound engineer who concentrates on the technical aspects of recording, whereas the music producer keeps an eye on the overall project's marketability.During the 1890s, Fred Gaisberg ran the first recording studio and provided the closest approximation of production by guiding an opera singer closer or further away from a gramophone's horn to match the dynamics in the score. (Citation: Gronow and Saunio 1998, p.8; Moorefield 2005, p.1).However in the first part of the 20th century the record producer's role was similar to the role of a film producer in that the record producer organized and supervised recording sessions, paid technicians, musicians and arrangers, and sometimes chose material for the artist. In the mid-1950s a new category emerged, that of the independent record producer. Among the most famous early independent producers are the famed songwriting-production duo Leiber & Stoller, "Wall of Sound" creator Phil Spector and British studio pioneer Joe Meek.Magnetic tape enabled the establishment of independent recording studios in major recording centres such as London, Los Angeles and New York. Unlike the old record company studios, which were effectively a "closed shop", these new studios could be hired by the hour by anyone who could afford to do so.The biggest and best commercial studios were typically established and operated by leading recording engineers. They were carefully constructed to create optimum recording conditions, and were equipped with the latest and best recording equipment and top-quality microphones, as well as electronic amplification gear and musical instruments.Top-line studios such as Olympic Studios in London, Fine Recording in New York City, United Western Recorders, and Musart in Los Angeles quickly became among the most sought-after recording facilities in the world, and both these studios became veritable "hit factories" that produced many of the most successful pop recordings of the latter 20th century.Prior to the 1950s, the various stages of the recording and marketing process had been carried out by different professionals within the industry A&R managers found potential new artists and signed them to their labels; professional songwriters created new material; publishing agents sold these songs to the A&R people; staff engineers carried out the task of making the recordings in company-owned studios.Freed from this traditional system by the advent of independent commercial studios, the new generation of entrepreneurial producers many of whom were former record company employees themselves were able to create and occupy a new stratum in the industry, taking on a more direct and complex role in the musical process. This development in music was mirrored in the TV industry by the concurrent development of videotape recording and the consequent emergence of independent TV production companies like Desilu.The new generation of independent producers began forming their own record production companies, and in many cases they also established their own recording labels, signing deals that enabled the recordings they produced to be manufactured and distributed by a major record company. This usually took the form of a lease deal, in which the production company leased the usage rights to the original recording to a major label, who would press, distribute and promote the recording as their own, in return for a percentage of any profit; the ownership of the master recordings typically reverted to the producer after the deal expired.Producers would now typically carry out most or all of the various production tasks themselves, including selecting and arranging songs, overseeing sessions (and sometimes also engineering the recordings) and even writing the material,[2] although it became a common practice for producers to claim a writing credit even if they did not actually contribute to the song.Independent music production companies rapidly gained a significant foothold in popular music and soon after became the main intermediary between artist and record label, discovering and signing new artists to production contracts, producing the recordings and then licensing the finished product to record labels for pressing, promotion and sale. (This was a novel innovation in the popular music field, although a broadly similar system had long been in place in many countries for the production of content for broadcast radio.) The classic example of this transition is renowned British producer George Martin, who worked as a staff producer and A&R manager at EMI for many years, before branching out on his own and becoming a highly successful independent producer with his AIR (Associated Independent Recordings) production company and studios.As a result of these changes, record producers began to exert a strong influence, not only on individual careers, but on the course of popular music. A key example of this is Phil Spector, who defined the gap between early rock and roll and the Beatles (19591964). Although many of Spector's s productions were credited to acts such as The Ronettes, The Crystals, the Righteous Brothers, the Paris Sisters and Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans, in reality they were created using a crack team of top-rank Los Angeles session players (now known as "The Wrecking Crew") and often featured an interchangeable lineup of lead singers, including Ronnie Spector and Darlene Love. The prime example of Spector's modus operandi is the record widely regarded as his masterpiece, "River Deep, Mountain High". It is credited to "Ike & Tina Turner", but it is now well known that Ike Turner was paid $20,000 to stay away from the sessions; the backing track was in fact performed by the Wrecking Crew, and the backing vocals were provided by a chorus of 21 singers  Ikettes Janice Singleton and Diane Rutherford and most of the female singers on Spector's roster, including Ronnie Spector, Darlene Love and Cher. Spector's Wall of Sound production technique also persisted after that time with his select recordings of the Beatles, the Ramones, Leonard Cohen, George Harrison, Dion and Ike and Tina Turner.Some producers also became de facto recording artists, creating records themselves or with anonymous studio musicians and releasing them under a pseudonym. In the USA, some of the earliest examples in popular music were the novelty records released under the name Alvin & The Chipmunks, which became hits in many countries in the mid-1950s. These records, written, performed and produced by entertainer David Seville, relied on the simple gimmick of recording an instrumental track, then overdubbing the vocals while the tape ran at half-speed. When played back at regular speed, the music would sound normal, and the voices would remain synchronised with the music, but the pitch and timbre of the voices would be dramatically shifted up, creating the instantly recognisable, chirpy "helium" effect. In the UK in the early 1960s, Joe Meek was the first British pop producer to make records with studio-created groups, and he had major hits with singles like "Telstar" and Heinz's "Just Like Eddy".Other examples of this phenomenon include the records by fictional groups the Archies and Josie & the Pussycats, produced by Don Kirshner and Danny Jansen respectively, who were contracted by TV production companies to produce these records to promote the animated children's TV series of the same name. Similarly, Jeff Barry and Andy Kim recorded as the Archies. The same producer-as-artist phenomenon can be found with many modern-day pop-oriented street- and electronic-music artists. In later years this became a prominent and often successful sideline for major producers, as evidenced by the string of albums by the studio group The Alan Parsons Project (created by former EMI/Abbey Road staff engineer Alan Parsons) and the successful musical adaptation of H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds, devised and produced by former David Essex producer Jeff Wayne.Another change that occurred for the role of producers occurred progressively over the 1950s and 1960s. The development of multitrack recording and new technology such as electric guitars, amplifiers, and better microphones led to a fundamental change in the way recordings were made. The goal of recording no longer was simply accurately capturing and documenting live performance. Instead producers could manipulate sounds to an unprecedented degree and producers like Spector and Martin were soon creating recordings that were, in practical terms, almost impossible to realise in live performance. Producers became creative figures in the studio and were no longer reserved to the role of functional engineer. Examples of such engineers includes George Martin, Joe Meek, Teo Macero, Phil Spector, Brian Wilson, and Biddu. These producers became known as creative producers who turned the studio into a creative space.Another notable related phenomenon in the 1960s was the emergence of the performer-producer. As pop acts like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and The Kinks rapidly gained expertise in studio recording techniques, the leaders of many of these groups eventually took over as producers of their own work. In some cases this was not credited at the time - many recordings by acts such as The Rolling Stones, The Small Faces, Donovan, The Kinks and The Who are credited to their various producers of the time, Andrew Loog Oldham. Mickie Most or Shel Talmy, but many of these performers have since asserted that many of their recordings in this period were (in practical terms) either self-produced - e.g. The Rolling Stones' Decca recordings - or were collaborations between the group and their recording engineer - e.g. The Small Faces' Immediate recordings, which were made with Olympic Studios engineer Glyn Johns.Similarly, although The Beatles' productions were credited to George Martin throughout their recording career, many sources now attest that Lennon and McCartney in particular had an increasing influence on the production process as the group's career progressed,and especially after the band retired from touring in 1966. The Beach Boys are probably the best example of this trend - within two years of the band's commercial breakthrough, group leader Brian Wilson had taken over from his father Murry, and he was sole producer of all their recordings between 1963 and 1967. Alongside The Beatles and Martin, Wilson also pioneereed many production innovations - by 1964 he had developed Spector's techniques to a new level of sophistication, using multiple studios and multiple "takes" of instrumental and vocal components to capture the best possible combinations of sound and performance, and then using tape editing extensively to assemble a perfect composite performance from these elements.There are numerous different technologies utilized by the producer. In modern day recordings, recording and mixing tasks are centralized within computers. However, there is also the main mixer, outboard effects gear, MIDI controllers, and the recording device itself.Various schools and colleges offer courses to prepare for careers in music production. Examples include Berklee, Point Blank Music College, ILM Academy, and SAE Institute.[citation needed]1 History

Pendulum is an Australian/British drum and bass duo[2] founded in 2002 in Perth, Western Australia by Rob Swire, Gareth McGrillen, and Paul Harding.[3] As of 2012, the live band have parted ways to focus on side projects, but the DJ set will remain active. Swire has also said that they may possibly make another album, but not until at least 2014.[4]Swire and McGrillen were members of the metal band known as Xygen. After hearing Konflict's "Messiah" at a club, they were inspired to enter into the drum and bass genre.[5] They founded Pendulum with Harding, who was a veteran DJ in the drum and bass scene. In 2003 the band relocated to the United Kingdom.While Hold Your Colour holds true to the drum and bass genre, Pendulum have since experimented with mixing other genres into their work, as can be heard on In Silico and Immersion. Their newer releases incorporate styles from genres such as hard rock, heavy metal,[6] electronic rock, grime, dubstep, breakbeat and electro house.Pendulum formed in Perth, Australia and released their first song, "Vault", as the A-side of the Kingz of the Rollers EP in 2003.[7]After releasing several singles such as "Spiral" / "Ulterior Motive" and many tracks to be included in their forthcoming release, Pendulum released their debut album, Hold Your Colour in 2005. Notably, the album has successfully become one of the most popular drum and bass albums ever sold. The album has sold 225,000 copies in the UK alone. It entered the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart for the first time on 25 May 2008, peaking at No.29 by 16 August.The coverdesign of the album was done by Vince Peersman of www.foldesign.com, one of the most prominent graphic artists for drum 'n bass music covers.The album was re-issued in 2007, and had a slightly different track listing. The final two songs, "Another Planet" and "Still Grey" were replaced by "Blood Sugar" and "Axle Grinder". As well as this, the re-issued version also erroneously contains gaps at the end of each track, causing the album to lose its original sense of flow.Their second album, In Silico, was released in May 2008. This release saw the band's first deviation from the drum and bass genre and incorporated more rock sounds. The second single from the album, "Propane Nightmares", peaked at No.9 in the UK Singles Chart, and brought the band mainstream success. In 2008 in support of the album, Pendulum played at numerous European music festivals and undertook their first tour of North America. At the end of the year the band filmed a live DVD on 4 and 5 December 2008, at the Brixton Academy. This was later released in June 2009.[8]Pendulum once again toured Europe in 2009. During this tour they announced that they were working on their third studio album, Immersion. It was announced in December that Pendulum will be touring for their new album in May 2010. The release date of the album was announced to be sometime "in May" during the live preview party at Matter, and was then announced to be released on 24 May.Pendulum previewed their album Immersion at the Ear Storm night at Londons Matter nightclub on Friday 22 January, as well as streaming the material on their official website.[9] "Salt In The Wounds", a track from their new album, was Zane Lowe's Hottest Record In The World on BBC Radio 1 on 25 January 2010. It was stated however that it was a street-level release and was not an official single. On Zane Lowe's show, it was also announced that he wanted to join the band and the first single from the new album would be called "Watercolour".[10] also received its first play on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on 8 March 2010, and was his Single Of The Week for that week.[11] The music video for "Watercolour" was released on 31 March and premiered on their MySpace page, and also in the members area of their official website, The Other Side. A day later, on 1 April, another music video was released, this time for "Salt In The Wounds". The video is unique in that it is, according to the band's website, "...the worlds first 360 interactive music video." Viewers can move the camera around in the video. Six letters are hidden throughout the video. Once these letters are found, the viewer can enter them as a code and claim a free download of "Salt In The Wounds".[12] Otherwise, "Watercolour" claimed the No.4 spot in the UK Single Chart, making it their biggest hit to date.On 21 May 2010, the band headlined the annual Radio 1's Big Weekend festival which was held at the Vaynol Estate, Bangor, Gwynedd.The second single from the album, "Witchcraft", was released on 18 July and charted at No.29 in the UK Singles chart, making it their third highest charted single in the UK. The third single from Immersion was "The Island", and just missed the UK Top 40 at No.41. Rob Swire had stated that if it had achieved greater success than "Witchcraft", he would have released a song entitled "Ransom", which was taken off Immersion before the album's release. "Ransom" was previewed however and became a fan favourite. As it did not do better, Swire revealed the original files for "Ransom" were corrupted, and that he has no plans to recreate them, therefore it will not be released. However, on 6 April 2011, Pendulum released "Ransom" as a single via their website with all proceeds going to the Help for Japan fund post the tsunami. "Crush" was released as the fourth single in January 2011.In January 2011, Pendulum released a Deluxe Edition of Immersion via iTunes which contained the album's original 15 tracks and a collection of remixes of "Watercolour", "Witchcraft" and "The Island" by other artists including deadmau5, Tisto and Chuckie. Both the UK and US store were also given the music videos of those three tracks in the release. However, more remixes were released in the UK store along with extra videos, including a trailer of footage from their live show at Wembley Arena that took place on 28 May 2010.On 26 October 2010, Swire announced via Twitter that a new record is in the works. This new record is set to be heavily punk influenced.[13] The next album is expected to be a significant departure from usage of drum and bass tempo, for a faster tempo in the form of punk, and a slower tempo in the form of dubstep.[14]On 29 March 2011 via Twitter, Swire revealed that there would be no "new album" for a while. He added that there would be "def new material" later in the year.Pendulum opened for Linkin Park on several selected dates during the band's 2011 "A Thousand Suns" North American tour.,[15] also headlining their own tour and being supported by Innerpartysystem.Pendulum played at the 2011 Download Festival,[16] Oxegen,[17] The Eden Sessions,[18] Glastonbury Festival[19] and T In The Park,[20] V Festival, headlined Global Gathering, an exclusive London show at South West Four [21] and finally headlined the first night of Bestival on the Isle Of Wight.On 5 April 2011 Pendulum announced via Twitter and the band's website that a previously unreleased track from Immersion, titled "Ransom", would be released on Pendulum's website, with 100% of the proceeds going to help disaster relief efforts in the wake of the 2011 Japanese tsunami.[22]Pendulum headlined at Rhythm & Vines 2011 in Gisborne, New Zealand. The band is taking a break from touring during 2012 in order to take part in side projects.Pendulum is part of major Headliners on Main Stage lineup at LovEvolution 2011 Dance Festival & Parade in Oakland, California, which has over 50 DJs and 15 or more parade floats.On 3 January 2012, Pendulum announced via Twitter that they would be taking a hiatus from touring while thanking their fans for the last several years. They went on to state that they might create a new record in 2013.[23] Swire stated on his personal Twitter that Pendulum is on hiatus, as Knife Party is now his primary project.[24]On 16 June 2012, Rob Swire announced via Twitter that there will be no further Pendulum live shows and there are no current plans for a new album in 2013. Although there are no live shows taking place in the near future according to the band, El Hornet & MC Verse still perform DJ Sets across the world.In 2012 Rob Swire and fellow member Gareth McGrillen announced in various interviews and on Swire's Twitter that a project called Knife Party had been created. The side project is not linked in any means to Pendulum and will consist of electro house, dubstep and other club genres, and is now the duo's primary project.When Pendulum was formed, their musical style was considerably more drum and bass sounding than the work they were known later in the career. Signature tunes such as "Masochist", "Vault", "Back 2 You" and "Voyager", which were released on labels such as Uprising Records, 31 Records, Renegade Hardware and Low Profile Records, have a darker, more amelodic air to them which is substantially absent from their later productions. The band's newer work is regarded as generally leaning heavily towards a mainstream, dance-driven sound. Early work such as "Another Planet" seems to indicate an early affinity with a more global sound, similar to other Breakbeat Kaos artists such as DJ Fresh and Adam F.The group has produced various remixes of other artists also; one the best-known being the remix of "Voodoo People", originally by The Prodigy. In 20082010, they covered/remixed songs including Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song", Linkin Park's "The Catalyst", Calvin Harris's "I'm Not Alone", Coldplay's "Violet Hill", and Metallica's "Master of Puppets". Pendulum's versions of "I'm Not Alone" and "Master Of Puppets" both exist as studio recordings but have not been officially released, and are only previewed during DJ sets. The original live version of "Master of Puppets" was played as an instrumental introduction for "Slam", and was featured on their first live album/DVD. During their American tour as the supporting band for Linkin Park, the song was played in its entirety, with Rob doing vocals. Pendulum have also remixed their own music and, on occasion, television theme songs, such as Australian television's "ABC News Theme" in May 2010. The remix proved to be immensely popular with listeners of Australian youth radio station triple j, polling at number 11 in the 2010 Triple J Hottest 100 countdown.[25]Pendulum's musical style consisted of a fusion of drum and bass (along with other electronic genres), alternative rock and heavy metal, with the inclusion of acoustic instruments. This creates a sound reminiscent of industrial metal, albeit with much more prominent drum and bass and, more recently, dubstep influences. Some songs, such as "Slam", "Propane Nightmares" and "Witchcraft" are synth-led, whilst others, such as "Showdown", "The Tempest" and "Comprachicos", are guitar-led. Bassist Gareth McGrillen stated in an interview on Channel 4 that they use 13 computers during the live performances, all of which are mixing the sounds produced by the instruments in real time. Rob Swire stated in issues of TJECK magazine and Rock Sound magazine that he would like to begin producing songs with a punk style to them, excluding the inclusion of electronic sounds in the near future.[26] Pendulum were known to be fans of progressive rock and progressive metal bands, which may have inspired them to fuse multiple genres of music together, which is standard practice in those genres.In 2006, Pendulum's old label Breakbeat Kaos released an album containing a 2-year-old Pendulum DJ mix without their permission, resulting in group member Rob Swire later denouncing the album on public Internet forum Dogs On Acid.[27] This issue has since been resolved; DJ Fresh is included on the list of acknowledgements in the Immersion booklet, and Pendulum is now working with Breakbeat Kaos again, on the vinyl release of the singles "Witchcraft" and "The Island".[28]Electronic musician Goldie has criticized Pendulum's single "Granite" for being what he calls a "shit single", and accused the band of not acknowledging the drum and bass scene from which they came.[29] For the band's part, in an interview with The Times Swire cited "Goldie making concept albums about space and his mum"[citation needed] (in the words of The Times reporter) as one of the reasons why he was not initially keen on the genre; he claims to have been more into "breakbeat, straight up house and hardcore" before Gareth McGrillen, who is Pendulum's bassist and was Swire's bandmate in Xygen, introduced him to "more electronic" areas of the genre.[30] This issue has since been resolved as well, according to Gareth McGrillen in an interview on The Age.[31]Despite the live band no longer performing, Swire has stated he may do another album, just not until after 2013. Paul and Ben however still actively perform the DJ set.1 History

Trance is a genre of electronic dance music that developed in the 1990s in Germany.[5] It is characterized by a tempo of between 110 and 150 beats per minute,[5] repeating melodic phrases,[5] and a musical form that builds up and down throughout a track.[5] It is a combination of many styles of electronic music such as techno,[3] house,[1] pop,[3] chill-out,[3] classical music,[3]:16[4] and film music.[4]Trance employs aural dynamics to a great degree: A characteristic of virtually all trance songs is the soft mid-song breakdown,[3][5] beginning with and occurring after the orchestration is broken down and the rhythm tracks fade out rapidly, leaving the melody and/or atmospherics to stand alone for anywhere from seconds to a few minutes. When vocals are present in trance, they are generally sung by a female with a soaring, operatic voice ranging from mezzo-soprano to soprano, best described as "ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths".[8]Germany is regarded as the birthplace of trance music,[5] with the original melodic trance sound first appearing around 1993 in Frankfurt.[3]The origin of the term is uncertain; one theory suggests that the term is derived from the Klaus Schulze album Trancefer (1981) or the early trance act Dance 2 Trance.[citation needed] Other schools of thought argue the name may refer to an induced emotional feeling, high, euphoria, chills, or uplifting rush listeners claim to experience, while other suggestions trace the name to the actual trance-like states the earliest forms of the music attempted to emulate in the 1990s before the genre's focus changed.[5]Some trace trance's antecedents back to Klaus Schulze, a German experimental electronic music artist who concentrated on blending minimalist music with repetitive rhythms and arpeggiated sounds.[citation needed] In France, Jean Michel Jarre, an early electronic musician,[9] released two albums in the late 1970s: Oxygne in 1976 and Equinoxe in 1978.[citation needed] Also a possible antecedent, Neil Young's 1982 electronic album, Trans, bears a resemblance to the trance music genre.[10] Another possible antecedent is Yuzo Koshiro's electronic soundtracks for the Streets of Rage series of video games from 1991 to 1994.[11][12][13]Examples of early Trance releases include but are not limited to German duo Jam & Spoon's 1992 12" Single remix of the 1990 song The Age Of Love.,[1] German duo Dance 2 Trance's 1990 track "We Came in Peace".[5]As for the roots of contemporary trance[citation needed], some[1] trace it to Paul van Dyk's 1993 remix of Humate's 'Love Stimulation'.[1] In subsequent years, one genre, vocal trance, arose as the combination of progressive elements and pop music,[3] and the development of another subgenre, epic trance, had some of its origins in classical music.,[3] with film music also being influential.[4]Classic trance usually employs a "four-to-the-floor" time signature,[5] a tempo of 125 to 150 BPM,[5] and 32 beat phrases and is somewhat faster than house music.[14] A kick drum is usually placed on every downbeat and a regular open hi-hat is often placed on the upbeat or every 1/8th division of the bar.[5] Extra percussive elements are usually added, and major transitions, builds or climaxes are often foreshadowed by lengthy "snare rolls"a quick succession of snare drum hits that build in velocity, frequency, and volume towards the end of a measure or phrase.[5]Rapid arpeggios and minor scales are common features. Trance tracks often use one central "hook", or melody, which runs through almost the entire song, repeating at intervals anywhere between 2 beats and 32 bars, in addition to harmonies and motifs in different timbres from the central melody.[5] Instruments are added or removed every 4, 8, 16, or 32 bars.[5]In the section before the breakdown, the lead motiff is often introduced in a sliced up and simplified form,[5] to give the audience a "taste" of what they will hear after the breakdown.[5] Then later, the final climax is usually "a culmination of the first part of the track mixed with the main melodic reprise".[5]As is the case with many dance music tracks, trance tracks are usually built with sparser intros ("mix-ins") and outros ("mix-outs") in order to enable DJs to blend them together more readily.[3][5] As trance is more melodic and harmonic than much dance music[citation needed], the construction of trance tracks in such a way is particularly important in order to avoid dissonant (or "key clashing," i.e., out of tune with one another) mixes.[citation needed]Trance music is broken into a large number of sub-genres.[citation needed] Chronologically, the major sub-genres are Classic trance, Acid trance, Progressive trance,[3] Uplifting trance,[3] and Hard trance[citation needed]. Uplifting trance is also known as "Anthem trance", "Epic trance",[3] "Stadium trance", or "Euphoric trance",[5] and has been strongly influenced by classical music both in the 1990s[3] and at present with the development of the sub-genre "Orchestral uplifting trance" or "Uplifting trance with symphonic orchestra" by such artists as Andy Blueman, Soundlift, and Arctic Moon. Closely related to Uplifting Trance is Euro-trance, which has become a general term for a wide variety of highly commercialized European dance music. Several subgenres are crossovers with other major genres of electronic music. For instance, Tech trance is a mixture of trance and techno, and Vocal trance "combines [trance's] progressive elements with pop music".[3] Balearic beat, which is associated with the laid back vacation lifestyle of Ibiza, Spain, is often called "Balearic trance", as espoused by Roger Shah.[citation needed] The genre Dream trance originated in the mid-1990s, with its popularity then led by Robert Miles.The following is a list of dance music festivals that showcase Trance music.Electronic Dance Music festivals in the Netherlands are mainly organized by four companies ALDA Events, ID&T, UDC and Q-dance:Electronic Dance Music festivals in North America feature various EDM genres such as Trance, House, Techno, Electro, Dubstep, Breaks, and Drum & Bass:1 History

 Appearances (Goals).Wayne Mark Rooney (born 24 October 1985) is an English footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Manchester United and the England national team.Rooney made his senior international debut in 2003 becoming the youngest player to represent England, until he got beaten by Theo Walcott. He is England's youngest ever goalscorer.[4] He played at UEFA Euro 2004 and scored four goals, briefly becoming the competition's youngest goalscorer. Rooney featured at the 2006 and 2010 World Cups and is widely regarded as his country's best player.[5][6][7][8][9][10] He has won the England Player of the Year award twice, in 2008 and 2009. As of October 2012, he has won 78 international caps and scored 32 goals, making him England's fifth highest goalscorer in history.[11] Along with David Beckham, Rooney is the most red carded player for England, having been sent off twice.[12]Aged nine, Rooney joined the youth team of Everton, for whom he made his professional debut in 2002. He spent two seasons at the Merseyside club, before moving to Manchester United for 25.6million in the 2004 summer transfer window. The same year, Rooney acquired the nickname "Wazza".[13] Since then, with Rooney in the team, United have won the Premier League four times, the 200708 UEFA Champions League and two League Cups. He also holds two runner-up medals from the Champions League and has twice finished second in the Premier League. In April 2012, Rooney scored his 180th goal, making him United's fourth-highest goal-scorer of all time.[14]In 200910, Rooney was awarded the PFA Players' Player of the Year and the FWA Footballer of the Year. He has won the Premier League Player of the Month award five times, a record he shares with Steven Gerrard. He came fifth in the vote for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or and was named in the FIFPro World 11 for 2011. Rooney has won the 'Goal of the Season' award by the BBC's Match of the Day poll on three occasions, with his bicycle kick against rivals Manchester City winning the 'Premier League Goal of the 20 Seasons' award.[15] Rooney is the third highest-paid footballer in the world after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, with an annual income of 20.7m (18m) including sponsorship deals.[16]Rooney was born in Croxteth, Liverpool to Thomas Wayne and Jeanette Marie (ne Morrey) Rooney.[17] He is of Irish descent[18][19] and was brought up as a Roman Catholic[20][21] with younger brothers Graham and John;[22][23][24] all three attended Our Lady and St Swithin's primary school and the De La Salle Humanities College.[25] He grew up supporting his local club Everton.[26]Rooney began playing for Liverpool Schoolboys and until May 2010 he held the record of 72 goals scored in one season.[27] At age nine, Rooney played for Copplehouse boys' club in the local Walton and Kirkdale junior league and scored 99 goals in his final season before being spotted by Everton scout Bob Pendleton.[28] Rooney joined Everton at age nine,[29] and was the Everton mascot for the Merseyside derby against Liverpool as an 11-year-old.[30] In the 199596 season he scored 114 goals in 29 games for Everton's under-10s and 11s,[31] and by 15 years old he was playing for the under-19s.[32] He scored eight goals in eight games during Everton's run to the FA Youth Cup final in 2002.[33] This included one goal in the final defeat against Aston Villa and upon scoring he revealed a T-shirt that read, "Once a Blue, always a Blue."[29] Rooney was included in the first team squad for their training camp in Austria in the summer of 2002 and scored his first senior goal in a 31 friendly victory over SC Weiz on 15 July.[32]"Rooney is the biggest England talent I've seen since I arrived in England. There has certainly not been a player under 20 as good as him since I became a manager here."Rooney was an unused substitute in Everton's 10 away win over Southampton in April 2002.[35] His senior debut came the following season on 17 August in a 22 home draw against Tottenham,[36] at this time he became the second youngest first-team player in Everton history behind Joe Royle.[37] His first senior goals came on 2 October as he scored twice in a 30 away win over Wrexham in the League Cup.[38] These goals meant that Rooney was Everton's youngest-ever goalscorer at the time.[39] On 19 October, five days before his 17th birthday, Rooney scored a last-minute winning goal against Arsenal.[40] This goal ended Arsenal's 30-match unbeaten run,[41] and also made Rooney the youngest goalscorer in Premier League history, a record that has since been surpassed twice by both James Milner and James Vaughan.[42] He scored the only goal in a 10 away win over Leeds United fifteen days later.[43]In December, Rooney was named 2002's BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year.[44] Six days on from claiming this award he scored the winning goal against Blackburn Rovers in a 21 home win.[45] His first career red-card came on boxing day in a 11 away draw against Birmingham City for a late challenge on Steve Vickers.[46] In January 2003, Rooney signed his first professional contract which made him one of world football's highest-paid teenagers.[47] Rooney's first goal in 2003 came on 23 March, netting Everton's only goal in a 21 loss at Arsenal.[48] In April, he scored a goal in Everton's 21 home win over Newcastle United,[49] before hitting a last-minute winner against Aston Villa in another 21 home win.[50] He ended his debut season with 8 goals in 37 appearances in all competitions for the Toffees.[51]Rooney scored his first goal of the 200304 season in a 22 away draw against Charlton on 26 August 2003.[52] He did not find the net again until December when he scored in a 21 away win over Portsmouth,[53] and a 32 home win over Leicester City.[54] His final goal of 2003 came on his 50th league appearance, netting the only goal in a 10 home win over Birmingham on 28 December.[55] On 21 February 2004, Rooney netted his first Premier League brace in a 33 away draw against Southampton.[56] He scored the only goal in a 10 win over Portsmouth on 13 March,[57] before scoring in a 11 away draw against Leicester City one week later.[58] He scored his final goal of the season in a 11 away draw against Leeds United on 13 April.[59]Rooney's agent snubbed a three-year, 12,000-a-week contract offer from Everton in August 2004, leaving Manchester United and Newcastle United to compete for his signature. Everton rejected a bid of 20million from Newcastle,[60] and Manchester United ultimately won the bidding war with Rooney signing for them at the end of the month after a 25.6million deal with Everton was reached.[61] It was the highest fee ever paid for a player under 20 years old; Rooney was still only 18 when he left Everton.[62]Rooney was given the number 8 shirt upon his arrival at Old Trafford.[63] He made his United debut on 28 September in a 62 home win over Fenerbahe in the Champions League, scoring a hat-trick and laying on an assist.[64] These goals made Rooney the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League aged 18 years 335 days.[65] However, his first season with Manchester United ended without winning a trophy as they could only manage a third place finish in the league,[66] and failed to progress to the last eight of the Champions League.[67] United had more success in the cup competitions, but were edged out of the League Cup in the semi finals by a Chelsea side[68] who also won the Premier League title that season,[69] and a goalless draw with Arsenal in the FA Cup final was followed by a penalty shoot-out defeat.[70] However, Rooney was United's top league scorer that season with 11 goals, and was credited with the PFA Young Player of the Year award.[71]In September 2005, Rooney was sent off in a Champions League clash with Villarreal of Spain (which ended in a goalless draw) for sarcastically clapping the referee who had booked him for an unintentional foul on an opponent.[72] His first trophy with United came in the 2006 League Cup,[73] and he was also named man of the match after scoring twice in United's 40 win over Wigan Athletic in the final.[74] In the Premier League, however, an erratic start to the season left title glory looking unlikely for United and their title hopes were ended in late April when they lost 30 away to champions Chelsea and had to settle for second place.[75] Rooney sustained a broken metatarsal in that game after a tackle made by Paulo Ferreira.[76] Rooney's goalscoring further improved in the 200506 season, as he managed 16 goals in 36 Premier League games.[77]Rooney was sent off in an Amsterdam Tournament match against Porto on 4 August 2006 after hitting Porto defender Pepe with an elbow.[78] He was punished with a three-match ban by the FA, following their receipt of a 23-page report from referee Ruud Bossen that explained his decision.[79] Rooney wrote a letter of protest to the FA, citing the lack of punishment handed down to other players who were sent off in friendlies. He also threatened to withdraw the FA's permission to use his image rights if they did not revoke the ban, but the FA had no power to make such a decision.[80]During the first half of the 200607 season, Rooney ended a ten-game scoreless streak with a hat-trick against Bolton Wanderers,[81] and he signed a two-year contract extension the next month that tied him to United until 2012. By the end of April, a combination of two goals in an 83 aggregate quarter-final win over Roma and two more in a 32 semi-final first leg victory over Milan.[82] By the end of that season, he had scored 14 league goals.[83] Rooney collected his first Premier League title winner's medal at the end of the 200607 season.[84]In June 2007, Rooney was handed number 10, last worn by Ruud van Nistelrooy.[85][86] He fractured his left metatarsal in United's opening-day goalless draw against Reading on 12 August,[87] the same injury he had suffered to his right foot in 2004.[88] After being sidelined for six weeks, he returned for United's 10 Champions League group stage win over Roma on 2 October, scoring the match's only goal.[89] However, barely a month into his return, Rooney injured his ankle during a training session on 9 November, and missed an additional two weeks.[90] His first match back was against Fulham on 3 December, in which he played 70 minutes.[91] Rooney missed a total of ten games and finished the 200708 season with 18 goals (12 of them in the league),[77] as United clinched both the Premier League[92] and the Champions League, in which they defeated league rivals Chelsea[93] in the competition's first-ever all-English final.[94]On 4 October 2008 in an away win over Blackburn Rovers, Rooney became the youngest player in league history to make 200 appearances.[95] On 14 January after scoring the only goal of the game 54 seconds into the 10 win over Wigan Athletic, Rooney limped off with a hamstring ailment in the eighth minute. His replacement, Carlos Tvez, was injured himself shortly after entering the game, but stayed on.[96] Rooney was out for three weeks, missing one match apiece in the League Cup and FA Cup, along with four Premier League matches.[97] On 25 April 2009, Rooney scored his final league goals of the season against Tottenham. United scored five goals in the second half to come from 20 down to win 52. Rooney grabbed two goals, set up two and provided the assist that led to the penalty for United's first goal.[98] Rooney ended the season with 20 goals in all competitions. Once again, he managed 12 goals in the league.[77]Rooney's start to the new campaign got off to great scoring ways, grabbing a goal in the 90th minute of the 2009 Community Shield, though United lost the game to Chelsea on penalties.[99] He then scored the only goal of the opening game of the 200910 season against Birmingham City, taking his overall United tally to 99.[100] He failed to score in the next game, a historic 10 defeat to the hands of newly promoted Burnley at Turf Moor. On 22 August, he became the 20th Manchester United player to have scored at least 100 goals for the club, when he found the net twice in a 50 away win at Wigan Athletic.[101]On 29 August, United played Arsenal at Old Trafford. Rooney scored the equaliser from the penalty spot after Andrei Arshavin had put the Gunners ahead. The game finished 21 to Manchester United after Abou Diaby scored an own goal.[102] Five days later Rooney commented on his penalty against Arsenal: "Everyone who watches me play knows I am an honest player, I play the game as honestly as I can. If the referee gives a penalty there is nothing you can do."[103] On 28 November 2009, Rooney scored his first hat-trick for three years in a 41 away victory against Portsmouth, with two of them being penalties.[104] On 27 December 2009, he was awarded Man of the Match against Hull City. He was involved in all the goals scored in the game, hitting the opener and then giving away the ball for Hull's equalizing penalty. He then forced Andy Dawson into conceding an own goal and then set up Dimitar Berbatov for United's third goal which gave them a 31 victory.[105] On 30 December 2009, three days on from their victory over Hull, he grabbed another goal in United's 50 thrashing of Wigan in their final game of the decade.[106] On 23 January 2010, Rooney scored all four goals in Manchester United's 40 win over Hull City; three of the goals came in the last 10 minutes of the match. This was the first time in his career that he bagged four in one match.[107] On 27 January 2010, he continued his scoring run by heading the winner in the second minute of stoppage time against derby rivals Manchester City. This gave United a 43 aggregate win, taking them into the final, it was his first League Cup goal since netting two in the 2006 final.[108] On 31 January 2010, Rooney scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 31 win over Arsenal for the first time in the league at the Emirates, notably his first Premier League goal also came against Arsenal.[109] On 16 February 2010, Rooney hit his first European goals of the season, scoring two headers in the 32 away win against Milan in Manchester United's first ever win against them at the San Siro.[110] On 28 February 2010, he scored another header against Aston Villa (his fifth consecutive headed goal in a row) which resulted in Manchester United winning the League Cup final 21.[111] In the second leg of United's European tie against Milan, Rooney scored a brace in a resounding 40 home victory, taking his tally of goals this season to 30.[112] He then added two more to his tally five days later at Old Trafford, in a 30 league win over Fulham.[113]On 30 March 2010, during United's Champions League quarter-final first leg defeat against Bayern Munich at Munich's Allianz Arena, Rooney crumpled when he twisted his ankle in the last minute, hobbling off while Bayern were producing the build up that led to their second goal.[114] There were fears that he had received serious ligament damage or even a broken ankle, but it was announced that the injury was only slight ligament damage, and that he would be out for 2 to 3 weeks,[115] missing United's crunch match with Chelsea and the return leg against Munich the following week.[115] The team list for second leg yielded a massive surprise when Rooney was given a starting place in the United lineup.[116] Despite a 30 lead by the 41st minute, Munich snatched a goal back and United were later forced down to 10 men after Rafael da Silva was sent-off. Munich won the match after netting a second away-goal[116] and Rooney was substituted after re-damaging his ankle. On 25 April, Rooney was named the 2010 PFA Players' Player of the Year.[117]On 28 August 2010, Rooney scored his first goal of the season as he netted a penalty in a 30 home win over West Ham United.[118] In October, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson stated at a press conference that Rooney wanted to quit the club.[119] This came after a period of dispute as to the extent of Rooney's ankle injury, where Rooney had refuted Ferguson's claim that the injury was the reason Rooney had been dropped to the bench.[120] Rooney and his representatives released a statement regarding his decision to leave the club, insisting it is not down to money but ambition.[121] Following this statement, Rooney made a dramatic U-turn and agreed a new five-year contract at Manchester United until June 2015.[122]Rooney made his return to the first team as a substitute against Wigan on 20 November.[123] Four days later he returned to the starting line-up and scored a penalty in a 10 away win over Rangers in the Champions League.[124] He missed a penalty in a 10 home win over Arsenal on 13 December.[125] His first goal of the season from open play came on 1 January 2011 in a 21 away win over West Bromwich Albion.[126] On 1 February, Rooney scored twice and assisted Nemanja Vidi's goal in a 31 home win over Aston Villa.[127] On 12 February, Rooney scored an overhead volley in the 78th minute of the Manchester derby, which proved to be the winning goal in their 21 win over Manchester City.[128] After the match, Rooney said it was the best goal of his career,[129] before Sir Alex Ferguson described the strike as the best goal he has ever witnessed at Old Trafford.[130] Two weeks later he scored the third goal in a 40 away win over Wigan,[131] before opening the scoring in a 21 away loss to Chelsea on 1 March.[132] Rooney scored the second goal in a 20 home win over Arsenal in an FA Cup tie on 12 March.[133]On 2 April, United came from two goals down as Rooney scored his first hat-trick of the season in a 42 away win over West Ham United.[134] This was his fifth hat-trick for Manchester United, whilst the second goal was his 100th in the Premier League for the club.[135] He is the third Manchester United player to score 100 Premier League goals, joining Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes.[136] During Rooney's celebrations following his third goal, he swore into a pitchside camera and was subsequently charged by the Football Association for using offensive language.[137] Rooney accepted the charge, but not the automatic two-match ban which was handed to him.[138] He appealed against the length of the suspension, calling it "excessive", but failed to overturn the two-match ban which ruled him out of the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City on 16 April.[139] The following game on 6 April saw Rooney scored the only goal in a 10 away win against Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.[140] He followed this goal up with another strike in the semi-final first leg against German side Schalke on 26 April, scoring the second of a 20 away win.[141] This was the first time Rooney had returned to the Veltins-Arena in Gelsenkirchen since his sending off during the 2006 FIFA World Cup against Portugal.[142]On 14 May 2011, Rooney successfully converted a penalty for United to equalise and give them a 11 draw against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in the penultimate game of the Premier League season  enough to secure a record 19th top division title for United, and giving Rooney his fourth Premier League title winner's medal.[143]Rooney started the season with a goal in the first league game at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion. Rooney played a one-two with Ashley Young before a sharp turn and finish from outside the box which found the bottom corner of the goal. He also scored in the second game of the season, at home to Tottenham Hotspur, when he headed in a Ryan Giggs cross late in the game.[144] In late August, Rooney scored his 150th goal for United, the first of a hat-trick, helping to demolish Arsenal 82.[14] Rooney won man of the match, scoring two free kicks, a penalty, and also contributing an assist for Nani. He followed this up with another hat-trick in the next game; a 50 away win over Bolton Wanderers on 10 September, becoming only the fourth player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick in consecutive games.[145] These goals brought him level with Sir Bobby Charlton on seven United hat-tricks, joint fourth on the all-time list behind Denis Law, Jack Rowley and Dennis Viollet.[146] Rooney scored in United's next game, a 31 home win over Chelsea but did miss a penalty in the second half when he slipped on his run up and skied the ball over. After revelations about his father in the media and the fallout from his red card against Montenegro on international duty, he was left out of the starting line-up against Liverpool on 15 October 2011. He returned to action on 18 October 2011, where he scored two goals in the group stage-match against Oelul Galai and surpassed his former teammate Paul Scholes as the most-scoring Englishman in UEFA Champions League.[147]On 10 December, Rooney ended an 8 game goal drought with a brace against Wolves in a 41 win at Old Trafford. For the first goal he cut inside from the left and drilled in a low shot through the crowd of defenders. His second goal was assisted by Antonio Valencia who crossed the ball from the right wing and Rooney met it on the half volley to find the bottom right hand corner of the net. On 18 December, Rooney continued his goal scoring form heading home the opening goal against QPR, making it Manchester United's quickest goal of the season so far after just 52 seconds at Loftus Road. He was assisted by Antonio Valencia's cross. On 21 December, Rooney scored his 130th Premier League goal in his 300th Premier League appearance against Fulham at Craven Cottage with a long range effort that crashed in off the inside of the post in a 50 win. On 8 January, Rooney scored two goals in the FA Cup third round 32 away win against Manchester City at Etihad Stadium. His first goal was assisted by Antonio Valencia who swung the ball towards the far post, where Rooney bulldozed between Nani and Richards powering a header against the underside of the crossbar and into the net. Danny Welbeck was involved in Rooney's second goal. He was needlessly scythed down by Aleksandar Kolarov inside the penalty area, prompting the clear penalty award. City's goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon saved the initial Rooney spot kick, but the United striker calmly nodded the rebound into the unguarded goal. With his two goals, Rooney went past Mark Hughes in United's all-time top goalscorers table heading up to seventh place overall with 164 goals. On 14 January, Rooney made a big contribution to his team in a 30 home win against Bolton. Although he had missed a penalty and almost found the net on a few occasions, he did create two goals by assisting Paul Scholes for the first goal and later in the second half Danny Welbeck for the second goal. On 5 February, Rooney scored two goals from the penalty spot as United came back from a 30 deficit to draw 33 in a Premier League clash against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.On 11 February 2012, Rooney marked his 500th senior career game by scoring two goals as United beat rivals Liverpool 21 at Old Trafford. This was also his 350th game for United in all competitions.[148] On 4 March Rooney scored the first goal in a 31 away win against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane and went past Joe Spence in Manchester United's all-time top goalscorers table heading up to sixth place overall with 169 goals. He scored another brace in his next game, against Atletico Bilbao in the Europa League.[149] On 11 March Rooney scored the two goals that brought United the victory against West Bromwich Albion in a 20 home win. On 15 March, Rooney scored in the 2nd leg of the Europa League tie vs Athletic Bilbao in Bilbao despite United losing 21 on the night and 53 on aggregate.Rooney accidentally broke 9-year-old fan Jamie Thomas' wrist with a stray shot before Manchester United's 50 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 18 March 2012. Rooney was not aware of the incident at the time, but has apologised to the schoolboy and promised to send him a personalised gift.[150]Despite starting the opening game of the season against Everton,[151] Rooney was dropped to the bench for the second game against Fulham in favour of new signing Robin van Persie.[152] After coming on for Shinji Kagawa in the 68th minute, Rooney suffered a severe gash to his right leg caused by Fulham's Hugo Rodallega that kept him out for four weeks.[153] He made his come back on 29 September in a 3-2 loss against Tottenham.[154] 3 days later he assisted both Robin van Persie goals in 2-1 win against CFR Cluj in the UEFA Champions League.[155] He scored his first goals of the season in a 4-2 league win at home to Stoke City on 20 October, where he reached his 200th club goal.[156]Rooney became the youngest player to play for England when he earned his first cap in a friendly against Australia on 12 February 2003 at seventeen,[157] the same age at which he also became the youngest player to score an England goal.[158] Arsenal youngster Theo Walcott broke Rooney's appearance record by 36 days in May 2006.[159] This came after Wayne ignored calls from Irish supporters to play for the Republic of Ireland, whom he is eligible to play for due to his Grandmother being born in Ireland.[160]His first tournament action was at Euro 2004, in which he became the youngest scorer in competition history on 17 June 2004, when he scored twice against Switzerland;[161] however, this record was topped by Swiss midfielder Johan Vonlanthen four days later.[162] Rooney suffered an injury in the quarter-final match against Portugal and England were eliminated on penalties.[163]Following a foot injury in an April 2006 Premier League match, Rooney faced a race to fitness for the 2006 World Cup.[164] England attempted to hasten his recovery with the use of an oxygen tent,[165] which allowed Rooney to enter a group match against Trinidad and Tobago[166] and start the next match against Sweden.[167] However, he never got back into game shape and went scoreless as England bowed out in the quarter-finals, again on penalty kicks.[168]Rooney was red-carded in the 62nd minute of the quarter-final for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho as both attempted to gain possession of the ball, an incident that occurred right in front of referee Horacio Elizondo.[169] Rooney's Manchester United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo openly protested his actions, and was in turn shoved by Rooney.[169] Elizondo sent Rooney off, after which Ronaldo was seen winking at the Portugal bench.[169] Rooney denied intentionally targeting Carvalho in a statement on 3 July, adding, "I bear no ill feeling to Cristiano but I'm disappointed that he chose to get involved. I suppose I do, though, have to remember that on that particular occasion we were not teammates."[170] Elizondo confirmed the next day that Rooney was dismissed solely for the infraction on Carvalho.[171] Rooney was fined CHF5,000 for the incident.[172]Rooney top scored for England in their 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign with 9 goals; one behind the UEFA section's overall top goalscorer, Theofanis Gekas of Greece.[173] On 14 November 2009, Rooney captained England for the first time in a pre-tournament friendly with Brazil.[174]During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, after England drew with Algeria, the England players were booed off the pitch by supporters. Rooney made a comment as he left the pitch to television cameras saying, "Nice to see your home fans boo you, that's loyal supporters".[175] He later apologised for the comment made during a lacklustre tournament for England who were eliminated in the second round.[176]The Euro 2012 qualifications went well for England, as they qualified in first place of their group, winning five and drawing three games out of eight. Rooney scored three goals, one against Switzerland and two against Bulgaria. In the last qualifier against Montenegro (22), Rooney was sent off for a tackle on Miodrag Dudovi in the 74th minute.[177] At first, it was known that Rooney would miss at least one match in the opening round of the first phase at UEFA Euro 2012. After the game with Montenegro, Rooney sent a personal letter to UEFA in which he apologised and expressed regret for the tackle on Dudovi which earned him the red card.[178][179] Despite the letter, UEFA punished Rooney with a three game ban, meaning that he couldn't play in any of the group stage matches. After UEFA's announcement, Dudovi stated that he believed the sentence for Rooney was too severe and that he would defend him if needed. He later asked the UEFA to pardon Rooney. The FA then decided they would appeal to UEFA against the ban. On 8 December 2011, after The FA had appealed the ban,[180] UEFA reduced the sentence to two matches.[181] This meant that Rooney missed the matches against France and Sweden. He was able to play in the final match of the group stage against Ukraine on 19 June 2012, scoring the only goal of the game, allowing England to progress to the quarterfinals.[182] England were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals against Italy, who after a scoreless 120 minutes won 4-2 on penalties, although Rooney was able to net his spot-kick.After another international tournament in which the Englsh media criticized Rooney's performances,[183] Fabio Capello claimed Rooney "only plays well in Manchester"[184] However, on 12 October 2012, Rooney became England's 5th highest goalscorer of all time after scoring his 30th and 31st international goals in a 2014 World Cup qualifier against San Marino.[185] Rooney captained England for the first time in a competitive match in the same game.[186]Statistics accurate as of match played 1 December 2012[189][190]Statistics accurate as of match played 17 October 2012[191]In addition to Everton, Rooney also supports Celtic.[192] He is also a big supporter of the Leeds Rhinos rugby league club[193]In June 2011, he visited the Harley Street Hair Clinic and had a hair transplant.[194]It was announced in July 2011, that Wayne Rooney's jersey was the best-selling sports product that is under the auspices of the Premier League. Manchester United sold, during the 200910 season, between 1.2 million and one and a half million shirts and it is estimated that of that, Rooney's name was printed on several hundred thousand. The account is taken from official jerseys sales across the globe, not just in England.[195]Rooney met his wife, Coleen Rooney (ne McLoughlin), while both were at secondary school.[196] They married on 12 June 2008 after six years of dating, during which Rooney admitted to soliciting prostitution in Liverpool in 2004. "I was young and stupid. It was at a time when I was very young and immature and before I had settled down with Coleen."[197] He has a tattoo of the words "Just Enough Education to Perform", the title of an album by his favourite band, the Stereophonics; Coleen arranged for the group to play at their wedding reception.[198] The wedding ran into some controversy with the Catholic Church. The couple held a religious ceremony at the Abbey of Cervara, a converted monastery near Genoa, despite being warned by the local bishop's office against the plan. The bishop's office told the Rooneys that La Cervara is deconsecrated and not suitable for a wedding.[199] It suggested a different church, five miles away.[199] Nevertheless, the couple ignored the advice and Father Edward Quinn, their local priest from Croxteth, presided over a ceremony in which rings were exchanged.[200]In April 2006, he was awarded 100,000 in libel damages from tabloids The Sun and News of the World, who had claimed that he had assaulted Coleen in a nightclub. Rooney donated the money to charity.[201]The Rooneys reside in a 4.25million mansion in the village of Prestbury, Cheshire,[202] which was built by a company owned by Dawn Ward, the wife of former Sheffield United striker Ashley Ward.[203] He also owns property in Port Charlotte, Florida.[204] While Rooney was house hunting in Cheshire after signing with Manchester United, he spotted a pub sign that read "Admiral Rodney", which he misread as "Admiral Rooney." He nonetheless considered it a positive omen for his future home.[205][206] Rooney owns a French mastiff dog, which was reportedly bought for 1,250.[207]Rooney's wife Coleen announced on 7 April 2009 that the couple were expecting their first baby.[208] Coleen gave birth to their son, Kai Wayne Rooney, on 2 November 2009.[209]Rooney's younger brother, John Rooney, is also a professional footballer, who has played with Macclesfield Town, and in January 2011 signed a contract to play in Major League Soccer in the United States.[210] John was selected by the New York Red Bulls in the second round of the 2011 MLS SuperDraft.[211]Rooney has endorsement deals with Nike[212] (he is the face of their T90 Laser IV boots[213]), Nokia,[214] Ford,[215][216] Asda,[217] and Coca-Cola.[218] He has appeared on six straight UK-version covers of Electronic Arts' FIFA series from FIFA 06 (2005) to FIFA 12 (2011).[219][220][221] In October 2010, Rooney was dropped by Coca-Cola from one of its advertising campaigns in the wake of allegations about his private life.[222]On 9 March 2006, Rooney signed the largest sports book deal in publishing history with HarperCollins,[223] who granted him a 5million advance plus royalties for a minimum of five books to be published over a twelve-year period. The first, My Story So Far, an autobiography ghostwritten by Hunter Davies, was published after the 2006 World Cup.[224] The second publication, The Official Wayne Rooney Annual, was aimed at the teenage market and edited by football journalist Chris Hunt.[225]In July 2006, Rooney's lawyers went to the United Nations' World Intellectual Property Organisation to gain ownership of the Internet domain names waynerooney.com and waynerooney.co.uk, both of which Welsh actor Huw Marshall registered in 2002.[226] Three months later, the WIPO awarded Rooney the rights to waynerooney.com.[227]In July 2002, while Rooney was with Everton, agent Paul Stretford encouraged Rooney and his parents to enter the player into an eight-year contract with Proactive Sports Management. However, Rooney was already with another representation firm at the time, while Stretford's transaction went unreported to the FA, and he was thus charged with improper conduct. Stretford alleged in his October 2004 trial that he had secretly recorded boxing promoter John Hyland (an associate of Rooney's first agent) and two other men threatening and attempting to blackmail him for an undisclosed percentage of Rooney's earnings.[228]Stretford's case collapsed due to evidence that conflicted with his insistence that he had not signed Rooney, and on 9 July 2008, he was found guilty of "making of false and/or misleading witness statements to police, and giving false and/or misleading testimony."[228] In addition, the contract to which Stretford had signed Rooney was two years longer than the limit allowed by the FA. Stretford was fined 300,000 and banned from working as a football agent for eighteen months, a verdict he promptly appealed.[228]Stretford left Proactive in 2008 and took Rooney with him. Proactive later sued Rooney, claiming 4.3million in withheld commissions. In July 2010, Proactive was awarded only 90,000 as restitution.[229]On 1 September 2006, Everton manager David Moyes sued Rooney for libel after the tabloid newspaper the Daily Mail published excerpts from Rooney's 2006 autobiography that accused the manager of leaking Rooney's reasons for leaving the club to the press.[230] The case was settled out of court for 500,000 on 3 June 2008, and Rooney apologised to Moyes for "false claims" he had made in the book regarding the matter.[231]Rooney reportedly had sex with prostitute Jennifer Thompson on a number of occasions in 2009, while his wife Coleen was pregnant with son Kai.[232][233] Prostitute Helen Wood says Rooney paid 1,000 for a threesome with her and Jennifer Thompson in a Manchester hotel whilst Coleen was five months pregnant.[234] It was reported his solicitors tried to fight the allegations when they first surfaced in early August 2010, but he was unable to prevent the publication of the fresh allegations as he had previously spoken of his shame at paying for sex.[235][236] Alex Ferguson has suggested Rooney's form for Manchester United had suffered as he struggled to cope with the intense media scrutiny surrounding his private life due to these allegations.[237]  1 Early life2 Club career

Memetics is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with Darwinian evolution, originating from the popularization of Richard Dawkins' 1976 book The Selfish Gene.[1] It purports to be an approach to evolutionary models of cultural information transfer.The meme, analogous to a gene, was conceived as a "unit of culture" (an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour, etc.) which is "hosted" in one or more individual minds, and which can reproduce itself, thereby jumping from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief is seenwhen adopting the intentional stance[1][2]as an idea-replicator reproducing itself in a new host. As with genetics, particularly under a Dawkinsian interpretation, a meme's success may be due to its contribution to the effectiveness of its host.Memetics is also notable for sidestepping the traditional concern with the truth of ideas and beliefs. Instead, it is interested in their success.The Usenet newsgroup alt.memetics started in 1993 with peak posting years in the mid to late 1990s.[3] The Journal of Memetics was published electronically from 1997 to 2005.[4]In his book The Selfish Gene (1976), the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins used the term meme to describe a unit of human cultural transmission analogous to the gene, arguing that replication also happens in culture, albeit in a different sense. In his book, Dawkins contended that the meme is a unit of information residing in the brain and is the mutating replicator in human cultural evolution. It is a pattern that can influence its surroundings  that is, it has causal agency  and can propagate. This created great debate among sociologists, biologists, and scientists of other disciplines, because Dawkins himself did not provide a sufficient explanation of how the replication of units of information in the brain controls human behaviour and ultimately culture, since the principal topic of the book was genetics. Dawkins apparently did not intend to present a comprehensive theory of memetics in The Selfish Gene, but rather coined the term meme in a speculative spirit. Accordingly, the term "unit of information" came to be defined in different ways by many scientists.The modern memetics movement dates from the mid 1980s. A January 1983 Metamagical Themas column[5] by Douglas Hofstadter, in Scientific American, was influential as was his 1985 book of the same name. "Memeticist" was coined as analogous to "geneticist" originally in The Selfish Gene. Later Arel Lucas suggested that the discipline that studies memes and their connections to human and other carriers of them be known as memetics by analogy with 'genetics.'"[6] Dawkins' The Selfish Gene has been a factor in drawing in people of disparate intellectual backgrounds. Another stimulus was the publication in 1991 of Consciousness Explained by Tufts University philosopher Daniel Dennett, which incorporated the meme concept into a theory of the mind. In his 1991[7] essay "Viruses of the Mind", Richard Dawkins used memetics to explain the phenomenon of religious belief and the various characteristics of organised religions. By then, memetics had also become a theme appearing in fiction (e.g. Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash).However, the foundation of memetics in full modern incarnation originates in the publication in 1996 of two books by authors outside the academic mainstream: Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme by former Microsoft executive turned motivational speaker and professional poker player, Richard Brodie, and Thought Contagion: How Belief Spreads Through Society by Aaron Lynch, a mathematician and philosopher who worked for many years as an engineer at Fermilab. Lynch claimed to have conceived his theory totally independently of any contact with academics in the cultural evolutionary sphere, and apparently was not even aware of Dawkins' The Selfish Gene until his book was very close to publication.Around the same time as the publication of the books by Lynch and Brodie the e-journal Journal of Memetics  Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission appeared on the web. It was first hosted by the Centre for Policy Modelling at Manchester Metropolitan University but later taken over by Francis Heylighen of the CLEA research institute at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. The e-journal soon became the central point for publication and debate within the nascent memeticist community. (There had been a short-lived paper memetics publication starting in 1990, the Journal of Ideas edited by Elan Moritz.[8]) In 1999, Susan Blackmore, a psychologist at the University of the West of England, published The Meme Machine, which more fully worked out the ideas of Dennett, Lynch, and Brodie and attempted to compare and contrast them with various approaches from the cultural evolutionary mainstream, as well as providing novel, and controversial, memetic-based theories for the evolution of language and the human sense of individual selfhood.The term is a transliteration[citation needed] of the Ancient Greek  (mimts), meaning "imitator, pretender", and was used in 1904, by the German evolutionary biologist Richard Semon, best known for his development of the engram theory of memory, in his work Die mnemischen Empfindungen in ihren Beziehungen zu den Originalempfindungen, translated into English in 1921 as The Mneme. Until Daniel Schacter published Forgotten Ideas, Neglected Pioneers: Richard Semon and the Story of Memory in 2000, Semon's work had little influence, though it was quoted extensively in Erwin Schrdinger's prescient 1956 Tarner Lecture "Mind and Matter".The memetics movement split almost immediately into two. The first group were those who wanted to stick to Dawkins' definition of a meme as "a unit of cultural transmission". Gibran Burchett, another memeticist responsible for helping to research and co-coin the term memetic engineering, along with Leveious Rolando and Larry Lottman, has stated that a meme can be defined, more precisely, as "a unit of cultural information that can be copied, located in the brain". This thinking is more in line with Dawkins' second definition of the meme in his book The Extended Phenotype. The second group wants to redefine memes as observable cultural artifacts and behaviors. However, in contrast to those two positions, Blackmore does not reject either concept of external or internal memes.[9]These two schools became known as the "internalists" and the "externalists." Prominent internalists included both Lynch and Brodie; the most vocal externalists included Derek Gatherer, a geneticist from Liverpool John Moores University, and William Benzon, a writer on cultural evolution and music. The main rationale for externalism was that internal brain entities are not observable, and memetics cannot advance as a science, especially a quantitative science, unless it moves its emphasis onto the directly quantifiable aspects of culture. Internalists countered with various arguments: that brain states will eventually be directly observable with advanced technology, that most cultural anthropologists agree that culture is about beliefs and not artifacts, or that artifacts cannot be replicators in the same sense as mental entities (or DNA) are replicators. The debate became so heated that a 1998 Symposium on Memetics, organised as part of the 15th International Conference on Cybernetics, passed a motion calling for an end to definitional debates. McNamara demonstrated in 2011 that functional connectivity profiling using neuroimaging tools enables the observation of the processing of internal memes (i-memes) in response to external e-memes.[10]An advanced statement of the internalist school came in 2002 with the publication of The Electric Meme, by Robert Aunger, an anthropologist from the University of Cambridge. Aunger also organised a conference in Cambridge in 1999, at which prominent sociologists and anthropologists were able to give their assessment of the progress made in memetics to that date. This resulted in the publication of Darwinizing Culture: The Status of Memetics as a Science, edited by Aunger and with a foreword by Dennett, in 2000.In 2005, the Journal of Memetics  Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission ceased publication and published a set of articles on the future of memetics. The website states that although "there was to be a relaunch...after several years nothing has happened".[11] Susan Blackmore has left the University of the West of England to become a freelance science writer and now concentrates more on the field of consciousness and cognitive science. Derek Gatherer moved to work as a computer programmer in the pharmaceutical industry, although he still occasionally publishes on memetics-related matters. Richard Brodie is now climbing the world professional poker rankings. Aaron Lynch disowned the memetics community and the words "meme" and "memetics" (without disowning the ideas in his book), adopting the self-description "thought contagionist". Lynch lost his previous funding from a private sponsor and after his book royalties declined, he was unable to support himself as a private memetics/thought-contagion consultant.[citation needed] He died in 2005.Susan Blackmore (2002) re-stated the definition of meme as: whatever is copied from one person to another person, whether habits, skills, songs, stories, or any other kind of information. Further she said that memes, like genes, are replicators in the sense as defined by Dawkins.[12] That is, they are information that is copied. Memes are copied by imitation, teaching and other methods. The copies are not perfect: memes are copied with variation; moreover, they compete for space in our memories and for the chance to be copied again. Only some of the variants can survive. The combination of these three elements (copies; variation; competition for survival) forms precisely the condition for Darwinian evolution, and so memes (and hence human cultures) evolve. Large groups of memes that are copied and passed on together are called co-adapted meme complexes, or memeplexes. In her definition, the way that a meme replicates is through imitation. This requires brain capacity to generally imitate a model or selectively imitate the model. Since the process of social learning varies from one person to another, the imitation process cannot be said to be completely imitated. The sameness of an idea may be expressed with different memes supporting it. This is to say that the mutation rate in memetic evolution is extremely high, and mutations are even possible within each and every interaction of the imitation process. It becomes very interesting when we see that a social system composed of a complex network of microinteractions exists, but at the macro level an order emerges to create culture.This evolutionary model of cultural information transfer is based on the concept that units of information, or "memes", have an independent existence, are self-replicating, and are subject to selective evolution through environmental forces.[13] Starting from a proposition put forward in the writings of Richard Dawkins, it has since turned into a new area of study, one that looks at the self-replicating units of culture. It has been proposed that just as memes are analogous to genes, memetics is analogous to genetics. Memetics has been deemed a pseudoscience on several fronts.[13] Its proponents' assertions have been labeled "untested, unsupported or incorrect."[13]Luis Benitez-Bribiesca, a critic of memetics, calls it "a pseudoscientific dogma" and "a dangerous idea that poses a threat to the serious study of consciousness and cultural evolution" among other things. As factual criticism, he refers to the lack of a code script for memes, as the DNA is for genes, and to the fact that the meme mutation mechanism (i.e., an idea going from one brain to another) is too unstable (low replication accuracy and high mutation rate), which would render the evolutionary process chaotic.[14]Another criticism comes from semiotics, (e.g., Deacon,[15] Kull[16]) stating that the concept of meme is a primitivized concept of Sign. Meme is thus described in memetics as a sign without its triadic nature. In other words, meme is a degenerate sign, which includes only its ability of being copied. Accordingly, in the broadest sense, the objects of copying are memes, whereas the objects of translation and interpretation are signs.Mary Midgley criticises memetics for at least two reasons: One, culture is not best understood by examining its smallest parts, as culture is pattern-like, comparable to an ocean current. Many more factors, historical and others, should be taken into account than only whatever particle culture is built from. Two, if memes are not thoughts (and thus not cognitive phenomena), as Daniel C. Dennett insists in "Darwin's Dangerous Idea", then their ontological status is open to question, and memeticists (who are also reductionists) may be challenged whether memes even exist. Questions can extend to whether the idea of "meme" is itself a meme, or is a true concept.Dawkins responds in A Devil's Chaplain that there are actually two different types of memetic processes (controversial and informative). The first is a type of cultural idea, action, or expression, which does have high variance; for instance, a student of his who had inherited some of the mannerisms of Wittgenstein. However, he also describes a self-correcting meme, highly resistant to mutation. As an example of this, he gives origami patterns in elementary schools  except in rare cases, the meme is either passed on in the exact sequence of instructions, or (in the case of a forgetful child) terminates. This type of meme tends not to evolve, and to experience profound mutations in the rare event that it does. Some memeticists[who?], however, see this as more of a continuum of meme strength, rather than two types of memes.Another definition, given by Hokky Situngkir, tried to offer a more rigorous formalism for the meme, memeplexes, and the deme, seeing the meme as a cultural unit in a cultural complex system. It is based on the Darwinian genetic algorithm with some modifications to account for the different patterns of evolution seen in genes and memes. In the method of memetics as the way to see culture as a complex adaptive system, he describes a way to see memetics as an alternative methodology of cultural evolution. However, there are as many possible definitions that are credited to the word "meme". For example, in the sense of computer simulation the term memetic algorithm is used to define a particular computational viewpoint.The possibility of quantitative analysis of memes using neuroimaging tools and the suggestion that such studies have already been done was given by McNamara (2011).[10] This author proposes hyperscanning (concurrent scanning of two communicating individuals in two separate MRI machines) as a key tool in the future for investigating memetics.Memetics can be simply understood as a method for scientific analysis of cultural evolution. However, proponents of memetics as described in the Journal of Memetics  Evolutionary Models of Information Transmission believe that 'memetics' has the potential to be an important and promising analysis of culture using the framework of evolutionary concepts. Keith Henson who wrote Memetics and the Modular-Mind (Analog Aug. 1987)[17] makes the case that memetics needs to incorporate evolutionary psychology to understand the psychological traits of a meme's host.[18] This is especially true of time-varying, meme-amplification host-traits, such as those leading to wars.[19][20]Recently, Christopher diCarlo has developed the idea of 'memetic equilibrium' to describe a cultural compatible state with biological equilibrium. In "Problem Solving and Neurotransmission in the Upper Paleolithic" (in press), diCarlo argues that as human consciousness evolved and developed, so too did our ancestors' capacity to consider and attempt to solve environmental problems in more conceptually sophisticated ways. Understood in this way, problem solving amongst a particular group, when considered satisfactory, often produces a feeling of environmental control, stability, in shortmemetic equilibrium. But the pay-off is not merely practical, providing purely functional utilityit is biochemical and it comes in the form of neurotransmitters. The relationship between a gradually emerging conscious awareness and sophisticated languages in which to formulate representations combined with the desire to maintain biological equilibrium, generated the necessity for memetic equilibrium to fill in conceptual gaps in terms of understanding three very important aspects in the Upper Paleolithic: causality, morality, and mortality. The desire to explain phenomena in relation to maintaining survival and reproductive stasis, generated a normative stance in the minds of our ancestorsSurvival/Reproductive Value (or S-R Value).The application of memetics to a difficult complex social system problem, environmental sustainability, has recently been attempted at thwink.org. Using meme types and memetic infection in several stock and flow simulation models, Jack Harich has demonstrated several interesting phenomena that are best, and perhaps only, explained by memes. One model, The Dueling Loops of the Political Powerplace, argues that the fundamental reason corruption is the norm in politics is due to an inherent structural advantage of one feedback loop pitted against another. Another model, The Memetic Evolution of Solutions to Difficult Problems, uses memes, the evolutionary algorithm, and the scientific method to show how complex solutions evolve over time and how that process can be improved. The insights gained from these models are being used to engineer memetic solution elements to the sustainability problem.Francis Heylighen of the Center Leo Apostel for Interdisciplinary Studies has postulated what he calls "memetic selection criteria". These criteria opened the way to a specialized field of applied memetics to find out if these selection criteria could stand the test of quantitative analyses[disambiguation needed]. In 2003 Klaas Chielens carried out these tests in a Masters thesis project on the testability of the selection criteria.In Selfish Sounds and Linguistic Evolution,[21] Austrian linguist Nikolaus Ritt has attempted to operationalise memetic concepts and use them for the explanation of long term sound changes and change conspiracies in early English. It is argued that a generalised Darwinian framework for handling cultural change can provide explanations where established, speaker centred approaches fail to do so. The book makes comparatively concrete suggestions about the possible material structure of memes, and provides two empirically rich case studies.Australian academic S.J. Whitty has argued that project management is a memeplex with the language and stories of its practitioners at its core.[22] This radical, some say heretical[citation needed] approach requires project managers to consider that most of what they call a project and what it is to manage one is an illusion; a human construct about a collection of feelings, expectations, and sensations, cleverly conjured up, fashioned, and conveniently labeled by the human brain. It also requires project managers to consider that the reasons for using project management are not consciously driven to maximize profit. Project managers are required to consider project management as naturally occurring, self-serving, evolving and designing organizations for its own purpose.Swedish political scientist Mikael Sandberg argues against "Lamarckian" interpretations of institutional and technological evolution and studies creative innovation of information technologies in governmental and private organizations in Sweden in the 1990s from a memetic perspective.[23] Comparing the effects of active ("Lamarckian") IT strategy versus userproducer interactivity (Darwinian co-evolution), evidence from Swedish organizations shows that co-evolutionary interactivity is almost four times as strong a factor behind IT creativity as the "Lamarckian" IT strategy.1 History of the term

[24]Meme-complex  (sometimes abbreviated memeplex) is a collection or grouping of memes that have evolved into a mutually supportive or symbiotic relationship.[25] Simply put, a meme-complex is a set of ideas that reinforce each other. Meme-complexes are roughly analogous to the symbiotic collection of individual genes that make up the genetic codes of biological organisms. An example of a memeplex would be a religion.Memeoid  is a neologism for people who have been taken over by a meme to the extent that their own survival becomes inconsequential. Examples include kamikazes, suicide bombers and cult members who commit mass suicide. The term was apparently coined by H. Keith Henson in "Memes, L5 and the Religion of the Space Colonies," L5 News,September 1985 pp.58,[26] and referenced in the expanded second edition of Richard Dawkins' book The Selfish Gene (p.330). But in the strict sense all people are essentially memeoid, since no distinction can be made if one uses language, or memes use their host. In The Electronic Revolution William S. Burroughs writes: "the word has not been recognised as a virus because it has achieved a state of stable symbiosis with the host."Memetic Equilibrium  refers to the cultural equivalent of species biological equilibrium. It is that which humans strive for in terms of personal value with respect to cultural artefacts and ideas. The term was coined by Christopher diCarlo.[27]Cultural selection theoryDual inheritance theoryEgregoreEvolutionary epistemologyGeneral semanticsHuman-based genetic algorithmsKnowledge ecosystemMeme poolMentifactPhageSeme (semantics)Social constructionismSocial osmosisSociofactSociotypeSpimeThe Electronic RevolutionUniversal DarwinismViral marketingBoyd, Robert & Richerson, Peter J.

Summer Discovery, officially known as Musiker Discovery Programs, specializes in pre-college enrichment, middle school enrichment, community service and career focused internship programs. The Musiker family has directed award-winning, well supervised, educational teen summer programs for students for 46 years.[1] Although the company offers a wide variety of quality programs around the world, to this day, it is still a family-owned and operated organization.The Musiker familys dedication to teenagers and education began 46 years ago when Mike and Judy Musiker founded Musiker Student Tours in 1966.[3] Their sons, Bob and Jimmy Musiker, joined the organization in the early 1980s and assumed ownership in 1992. That year, the organization changed names from Musiker Student Tours, Inc. to Musiker Discovery Programs, Inc. to reflect the broad offerings available to students that now include pre-college enrichment, business internships, middle school enrichment, college admissions preparation and community service programs.The first Summer Discovery program began at UCLA in 1986, with locations and program offerings expanding tremendously since then. In 2009, Summer Discovery formed an exciting partnership with Derek Jeters organization, Jeter's Leaders. The joint venture awards Jeter's Leaders scholarships to attend Summer Discovery programs at leading colleges and universities in the U.S.[4]In 2010, Discovery Internships was created when Musiker Discovery Programs partnered with Dream Careers (internship programs for college students), to acquire Career Explorations (internship programs for high school students) and form Discovery Internships LLC.[5] Today, there are 10 Summer Discovery pre-college programs, 5 Discovery Internship programs, 2 Jr. Discovery middle school programs and 1 College Discovery Experience program in 7 states and 4 countries.Musiker Discovery Programs are directed by Bob and Jimmy Musiker, Director of Operations Wil Burns-Garcia, Office Manager Karen Tarantino and a bright, energetic full-time staff of 16 associates in the New York headquarters. The company operates year-round to ensure the best possible summer experiences for staff and students from around the world.Musiker Discovery Programs has been a growth business[6] since its founding in 1966, when Judy and Mike Musiker sold Camp Keewanee in Parksville, NY and ran their first of many Musiker Student Tours. From the introduction of the Discover America tour in 1967, the start of the European program in 1969, the beginning of the camping program in 1983, the introduction of the Alaskan Hawaii program in 1986, and continued introduction of new tours, Musiker Tours has been the innovator in active student tours.In the fall of 2008, Musiker Discovery Programs ceased offering student tours in favor of focusing their concentration on providing the best academic enrichment and internship programs.Summer Discovery Educational Programs began in 1986 on the campus of UCLA. Originally reserving space for 80 students, the program operated with 180 students from all over the world and the future prospects of educational programs in the summer on college campuses was bright. Two years later Summer Discovery at Cambridge University in England was introduced and since 1989, the campuses of the University of Michigan, Georgetown University, University of California at Santa Barbara, the University of Pennsylvania, Enforex Language School in Spain, Istituto Lorenzo deMedici in Italy, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China have joined the Summer Discovery Team.In recent years the roster of programs offered by Musiker Discovery Programs has increased with the introduction of Jr. Discovery middle school enrichment programs at UCLA and Georgetown and College Discovery college admissions program in Boston. Last year Musiker Discovery Programs announced the addition of the Discovery Internship programs in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles and London.This past summer, Musiker Discovery Programs had participants from 43 states and 55 countries and is recognized as a leading company in the industry[7] with more students choosing Summer Discovery each summer than any other program of its kind.Summer Discovery offers 2  6 week pre-college enrichment programs for high school students, affording them the opportunity to embark on a real college experience, just like a college student.[8] Summer Discovery is designed to introduce students to the collegiate atmosphere whilst providing them with a safe and comfortable environment within which they can build their independence and confidence.[9] Students live in a university residence hall while taking courses taught by university professors. The programs provide access to over 300 courses in environments that are intellectually stimulating, culturally and socially enriching, and fun.Discovery Internships is a tuition-based, all-inclusive 4 week customized internship program for high school students. Discovery Interns live in residence halls with other students from around the world while exploring a career of interest through an internship. The goal of Discovery Internships is to help motivated high school students stand out in the college admission process, gain valuable work experience and make more informed decisions about their college and career plans.The Princeton Review College Discovery Experience is designed to help students choose the college that is best suited for them.[10] During the intensive 2 week summer program, students will develop their knowledge of various schools through campus visits and tours run by the schools admissions office, improve their SAT scores through the Princeton Review SAT Preparation course, and create a personal college admissions profile which includes an application essay.[11]DiscoveryWorks is a community service program that runs in collaboration with Summer Discovery. It provides students with the opportunity to give back to the community by helping others while living in a university residence hall with other like-minded high school students. Certificates of completion listing hours served are awarded upon completion of the program. Past students have worked with underprivileged kids, restored the environment, cared for the elderly, volunteered in health services and so much more.Jr. Discovery is a 3 week summer enrichment experience for middle school students completing grades 6, 7 and 8. Jr. Discovery is designed to facilitate a positive transition from adolescence to young adulthood, and from middle school to high school. The Skills for Mind and Body curriculum aims to inspire independent thinking, creativity, personal growth, self-confidence, time management and life skills.1 History

Pearl Jam is an American rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. Since its inception, the band's line-up has included Eddie Vedder (vocals), Stone Gossard (guitar), Jeff Ament (bass), and Mike McCready (guitar). The band's current drummer is Matt Cameron, also of Soundgarden, who has been with the band since 1998.Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten. One of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam was criticized early on as being a corporate cash-in on the alternative rock explosion. However, over the course of the band's career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having "spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame."[1]To date, the band has sold over 31.5 million records in the U.S,[2] and an estimated 60 million worldwide.[3][4] Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade.[5] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to Pearl Jam as "the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s."[6]Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament were members of pioneering grunge band Green River during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmates Mark Arm and Steve Turner.[7] In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with Malfunkshun vocalist Andrew Wood, eventually organizing the band Mother Love Bone. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the PolyGram record label, which signed the band in early 1989. Mother Love Bone's debut album, Apple, was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died of a heroin overdose.[8]Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the resulting demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously.[9] After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament.[1] After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.[9]Irons passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his basketball buddy, San Diego, California singer Eddie Vedder.[10] Vedder was the lead vocalist for a San Diego band, Bad Radio, and worked part-time at a gas station. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him.[9] He then recorded the vocals to three of the songs ("Alive", "Once", and "Footsteps") in what he later described as a "mini-opera" entitled Momma-Son.[11] Vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were impressed enough to fly Vedder up to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band.[9]With the addition of Dave Krusen on drums, the band took the name Mookie Blaylock, in reference to the then-active All-Star basketball player. The band played its first official show at the Off Ramp Caf in Seattle on October 22, 1990,[12] and soon signed to Epic Records. However, concerns about trademark issues necessitated a name change; the band's name became "Pearl Jam".[6] In an early promotional interview, Vedder said that the name "Pearl Jam" was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for peyote-laced jam.[13] In a 2006 Rolling Stone cover story however, Vedder admitted that this story was "total bullshit", even though he indeed had a great-grandma named Pearl. Ament and McCready explained that Ament came up with "pearl", and that the band later settled on "Pearl Jam" after attending a concert by Neil Young, in which he extended his songs as improvisations of 1520 minutes in length.[1]Pearl Jam entered Seattle's London Bridge Studios in March 1991 to record its debut album, Ten[14] McCready said that "Ten was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and Eddie were along for the ride at that time."[15] Krusen left the band in May 1991 after checking himself into rehabilitation;[16] he was replaced by Matt Chamberlain, who had previously played with Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the "Alive" video, Chamberlain left to join the Saturday Night Live band.[17] Chamberlain suggested Dave Abbruzzese as his replacement. Abbruzzese joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam's live shows supporting Ten.Released on August 27, 1991, Ten (named after Mookie Blaylock's jersey number)[13] contained eleven tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. Ten's musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an "expansive harmonic vocabulary" with an anthemic sound.[18] The album was slow to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the Billboard charts.[14] Ten produced the hit singles "Alive", "Even Flow", and "Jeremy". Originally interpreted as an anthem by many,[9] Vedder later revealed that "Alive" tells the semi-biographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather, while his mothers grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father.[9] The song "Jeremy" (sample(helpinfo)) and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates.[19] Ten stayed on the Billboard charts for more than two years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13x platinum.[20]With the success of Ten, Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge explosion, along with Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. The band was criticized in the music press; British music magazine NME said that Pearl Jam was "trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets."[21] Nirvana's Kurt Cobain angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial sellouts,[22] and argued Ten was not a true alternative album because it had so many prominent guitar leads.[14] Cobain later reconciled with Vedder, and they reportedly were on amicable terms before Cobain's death in 1994.[1]Pearl Jam toured relentlessly in support of Ten. Ament stated that "essentially Ten was just an excuse to tour," adding, "We told the record company, 'We know we can be a great band, so let's just get the opportunity to get out and play.'"[23] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it."[15] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates."[24] In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on Saturday Night Live and MTV Unplugged and took a slot on that summer's Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, and Ministry, among others. The band contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the 1992 Cameron Crowe film Singles: "State of Love and Trust" and "Breath". Ament, Gossard and Vedder appeared in Singles under the name "Citizen Dick"; their parts were filmed when Pearl Jam was known as Mookie Blaylock.The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder.[9] While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for "Jeremy", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for "Black" in spite of pressure by the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs, despite it being common knowledge that music videos were one of the most vital sales tools any band had in its arsenal. However, Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed the listener from creating their own interpretation of the song stating that "Before music videos first came out, youd listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and youd come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression."[25] "Ten years from now," Ament said, "I don't want people to remember our songs as videos."[9]Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, "The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy."[26] Released on October 19, 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold 950,378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined.[27] The album set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release, which it held until broken by Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live.[28] Vs. included the singles "Go", "Daughter", "Animal", and "Dissident". Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, "Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than this one did with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut." He added, "Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife."[29] The band decided, beginning with the release of Vs., to scale back its commercial efforts.[30] The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of "Jeremy" and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band "ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans."[31] During the Vs. Tour, the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.[32]By 1994, Pearl Jam was "fighting on all fronts", as its manager described the band at the time.[33] Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Pearl Jam was committed to keeping their concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster, refused to waive the service charge. Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was forced to create from scratch its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas in order to perform. Pearl Jams efforts to organize a tour without the ticket giant collapsed which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmasters monopoly. An analysis of journalist Chuck Philips investigative series[34][35][36][37][38][39] in a well known legal monograph[40] concluded that it was hard to imagine a legitimate reason for Ticketmasters exclusive contracts with venues and contracts which covered such a lengthy period of time. The authors said, The pervasiveness of Ticketmaster's exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act. The United States Department of Justice was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D.C.[41] Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jams testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. Pearl Jams manager said he was gratified that that Congress recognized the problem as a national issue.[42] The band eventually canceled its 1994 summer tour in protest.[43] After the Justice Department dropped the case, Pearl Jam continued to boycott Ticketmaster, refusing to play venues that had contracts with the company.[44] Music critic Jim DeRogatis noted that along with the Ticketmaster debacle, "the band has refused to release singles or make videos; it has demanded that its albums be released on vinyl; and it wants to be more like its '60s heroes, The Who, releasing two or three albums a year." He also stated that sources said that most of the band's third album Vitalogy was completed by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic or the battle with Ticketmaster were to blame for the delay.[33]Pearl Jam wrote and recorded while touring behind Vs. and the majority of the tracks for its next album, Vitalogy, were recorded during breaks on the tour. Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by this time. Producer Brendan O'Brien said, "Vitalogy was a little strained. I'm being politethere was some imploding going on."[15] After Pearl Jam finished the recording of Vitalogy, drummer Dave Abbruzzese was fired. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, Abbruzzese disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott.[15] He was replaced by Jack Irons, a close friend of Vedder and the former and original drummer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young's 1994 Bridge School Benefit, but he was not officially announced as the band's new drummer until its 1995 Self-Pollution satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour long pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it.[45]Vitalogy was released first on November 22, 1994 on vinyl and then two weeks later on December 6, 1994 on CD and cassette. The CD became the second-fastest-selling in history, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week.[12] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that "thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, Vitalogy stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album."[46] Many of the songs on the album appear to be based around the pressures of fame.[47] The song "Spin the Black Circle", an homage to vinyl records, won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock Performance. Vitalogy also included the songs "Not for You", "Corduroy", "Better Man", and "Immortality". "Better Man" (sample (info)), a song originally written and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks there. Considered a "blatantly great pop song" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.[15]The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for Vitalogy, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined in.[48] Pearl Jam's initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the next three years.[49] Ament later said, "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career."[15] In the same year Pearl Jam backed Neil Young, whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album Mirror Ball. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band's name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album's liner notes.[6] Two songs from the sessions were left off Mirror Ball: "I Got Id" and "Long Road". These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam in the form of the 1995 EP, Merkin Ball.Following the round of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, "Making No Code was all about gaining perspective."[50] Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate break from the band's sound since Ten,[51] favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that "No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album."[52] The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination,[53] with Ament stating, "In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up."[53] Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles "Who You Are" (sample(helpinfo)), "Hail, Hail", and "Off He Goes". As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band's refusal to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was "a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time" and that "it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band."[15]Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band's fifth album represented more of a team effort between all members of the group, with Ament stating that "everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band."[54] On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band's early, straightforward rock sound.[55] Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has "turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they've come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten."[56] Lyrically, Yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code,[57] with Vedder saying, "What was rage in the past has become reflection."[58] Yield debuted at number two on the Billboard charts, but like No Code soon began dropping down the charts.[59] It included the singles "Given to Fly" and "Wishlist". The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for the song "Do the Evolution" from the album, its first music video since 1992.[60] A documentary detailing the making of Yield, Single Video Theory, was released on VHS and DVD later that year.In April 1998, Pearl Jam once again changed drummers. Jack Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron on an initially temporary basis,[61] but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. Pearl Jam's 1998 Yield Tour in North America marked the bands return to full-scale touring. The band's anti-trust lawsuit against Ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours. Many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be out-of-the-way and impersonal. For this tour and future tours, Pearl Jam once again began using Ticketmaster in order to "better accommodate concertgoers."[62] The 1998 summer tour was a big success,[63] and after it was completed the band released Live on Two Legs, a live album which featured select performances from the tour.In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded "Last Kiss", a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was recorded during a soundcheck and released on the band's 1998 fan club Christmas single. The following year, the cover was put into heavy rotation across the country. By popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999, with all of the proceeds going to the aid of refugees of the Kosovo War.[12] The band also decided to include the song on the 1999 charity compilation album, No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees. "Last Kiss" peaked at number two on the Billboard charts and became the band's highest-charting single.Following its full-scale tour in support of Yield, the band took a short break, but then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new album. On May 16, 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, Binaural. It was drummer Matt Cameron's studio recording debut with the band. The title is a reference to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer Tchad Blake, known for his use of the technique.[64] Binaural was the first album since the band's debut not produced by Brendan O'Brien, although O'Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. Gossard stated that the band members "were ready for a change."[26] Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone said, "Apparently as tired of grunge as everyone except Creed fans, Pearl Jam delve elsewhere." He added, "The album reflects both Pearl Jam's longstanding curse of self-importance and a renewed willingness to be experimental or just plain odd."[65] The album is lyrically darker than the band's previous album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as "pretty sombre."[57] Binaural included the singles "Nothing as It Seems" (sample(helpinfo)), one of the songs featuring binaural recording, and "Light Years". The album sold just over 700,000 copies and became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status.[66]Pearl Jam decided to record every show on its 2000 Binaural Tour professionally, after noting the desire of fans to own a copy of the shows they attended and the popularity of bootleg recordings. The band had been open in the past about allowing fans to make amateur recordings,[67] and these "official bootlegs" were an attempt to provide a more affordable and better quality product for fans.[68] Pearl Jam originally intended to release them to only fan club members, but the band's record contract prevented it from doing so. Pearl Jam released all of the albums in record stores as well as through its fan club. The band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the Billboard 200 at the same time.[69]Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour ended in tragedy on June 30, with an accident at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but it was already too late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event.[70] Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility.[71]A month after the European tour concluded, the band embarked on its two-leg 2000 North American tour. On performing after the Roskilde tragedy, Vedder said that "playing, facing crowds, being togetherit enabled us to start processing it."[15] On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. Vedder took the opportunity to thank the many people who had helped the band come together and make it to ten years. He noted that "I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something."[72] After concluding the Binaural Tour, the band released Touring Band 2000 the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour.Following the events of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Vedder and McCready were joined by Neil Young to perform the song "Long Road" from the Merkin Ball EP at the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert. The concert, which aired on September 21, 2001, raised money for the victims and their families.Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as "a pretty positive one" and "very intense and spiritual."[73] Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, "There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed."[74] Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles "I Am Mine" and "Save You". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as "Love Boat Captain". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said "Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogya muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours."[75] The track entitled "Arc" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs.[76]In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: Perth, Tokyo, State College, Pennsylvania, two shows from Madison Square Garden, and Mansfield, Massachusetts. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed Riot Act's "Bu$hleaguer", a commentary on President George W. Bush, with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had "impaled" the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band's Denver, Colorado show.[77]In June 2003, Pearl Jam announced it was officially leaving Epic Records following the end of its contract with the label. The band stated it had "no interest" in signing with another label.[78] The band's first release without a label was the single for "Man of the Hour", in partnership with Amazon.com.[79] Director Tim Burton approached Pearl Jam to request an original song for the soundtrack of his new film, Big Fish. After screening an early print of the film, Pearl Jam recorded the song for him. "Man of the Hour", which was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award, can be heard in the closing credits of Big Fish.The band released Lost Dogs, a two-disc collection of rarities and B-sides, and Live at the Garden, a DVD featuring the band's July 8, 2003 concert at Madison Square Garden through Epic Records in November 2003. In 2004, Pearl Jam released the live album, Live at Benaroya Hall, through a one-album deal with BMG.[80] 2004 marked the first time that Pearl Jam licensed a song for usage in a television show; a snippet of the song "Yellow Ledbetter" was used in the final episode of the television series Friends.[81] Later that year, Epic released rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 19912003), a Pearl Jam greatest hits collection spanning 1991 to 2003. This release marked the end of Pearl Jam's contractual agreement with Epic Records.[82]Pearl Jam played a show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; recordings from the show were compiled for the Live at Easy Street album and released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006. The band embarked on a Canadian cross-country tour in September 2005, kicking off the tour with a fundraising concert in Missoula, Montana for Democratic politician Jon Tester, then playing the Gorge Amphitheater before crossing into Canada. After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a Rolling Stones concert in Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, before closing the tour with a concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The official bootlegs for the band's 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl Jam's official website in MP3 form. Pearl Jam also played a benefit concert to raise money for Hurricane Katrina relief on October 5, 2005, at the House of Blues in Chicago, Illinois. On November 22, 2005, Pearl Jam began its first Latin American tour.[83]The work for Pearl Jam's follow-up to Riot Act began after its appearance on the 2004 Vote for Change tour. The time period between the two albums was the longest gap between Pearl Jam's studio albums to date and the new album was its first release for a new label. Clive Davis announced in February 2006 that Pearl Jam had signed with his label, J Records, which like Epic, is part of Sony Music Entertainment (then known as Sony BMG).[84] The band's eighth studio album, Pearl Jam, was released on May 2, 2006. A number of critics cited Pearl Jam as a return to the band's early sound,[85][86] and McCready compared the new material to Vs. in a 2005 interview.[87] Ament said, "The band playing in a roomthat came across. Theres a kind of immediacy to the record, and thats what we were going for."[88] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly said that "in a world full of boys sent to do a man's job of rocking, Pearl Jam can still pull off gravitas."[89] Current socio-political issues in the United States are addressed on the album. "World Wide Suicide", a song criticizing the Iraq War and U.S. foreign policy, was released as a single and topped the Billboard Modern Rock chart; it was Pearl Jam's first number one on that chart since "Who You Are" in 1996, and first number one on any chart in the United States since 1998 when "Given to Fly" reached number one on the Mainstream Rock chart. Pearl Jam also included the singles "Life Wasted" and "Gone".To support Pearl Jam, the band embarked on its 2006 world tour. It toured North America, Australia and notably Europe; Pearl Jam had not toured the continent for six years. The North American tour included three two-night stands opening for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.[90] The band served as the headliners for the Leeds and Reading festivals, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after Roskilde. Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde had nothing to do with "guts" but with trust in the audience.[91]In 2007, Pearl Jam recorded a cover of The Who's "Love, Reign o'er Me" for the Mike Binder film, Reign Over Me; it was later made available as a music download on the iTunes Music Store.[92] The band embarked on a 13-date European tour, and headlined Lollapalooza in Grant Park, on August 5, 2007.[93] The band released a CD box set in June 2007, entitled Live at the Gorge 05/06, that documents its shows at The Gorge Amphitheatre,[94] and in September 2007 a concert DVD, entitled Immagine in Cornice, which documents the band's Italian shows from its 2006 tour was released.[95]In June 2008, Pearl Jam performed as the headline act at the Bonnaroo Music Festival.[96] The Bonnaroo appearance took place amidst a twelve-date tour in the Eastern United States.[97] In July 2008, the band performed at the VH1 tribute to The Who alongside Foo Fighters, Incubus and The Flaming Lips.[98] In the days prior to Election Day 2008, Pearl Jam digitally released through its official website a free documentary film, entitled Vote for Change? 2004, which follows the band's time spent on the 2004 Vote for Change tour.[99]In March 2009, Ten was reissued in four editions, featuring such extras as a remastering and remix of the entire album by Brendan O'Brien, a DVD of the band's 1992 appearance on MTV Unplugged, and an LP of its September 20, 1992 concert at Magnuson Park in Seattle.[100] It was the first reissue in a planned re-release of Pearl Jam's entire catalog that led up to the band's 20th anniversary in 2011.[100] A Pearl Jam retrospective film directed by Cameron Crowe titled Pearl Jam Twenty[101] was also planned to coincide with the anniversary.[102] In 2011, Vs. and Vitalogy were reissued in the spring time in deluxe form.[101]Pearl Jam began work for the follow-up to Pearl Jam in early 2008.[103] In 2009, the band began to build on instrumental and demo tracks written during 2008.[104] The band's ninth studio album, Backspacer, its first to be produced by Brendan O'Brien since Yield.[103] Backspacer debuted at No.1 on the Billboard music charts, the band's first album to do so since No Code in 1996.[citation needed] The music on the record features a sound influenced by pop and New Wave.[105] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that "prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun."[106] Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now."[107] "The Fixer" was chosen as the album's first single.[108] Pearl Jam did not re-sign its record deal with J Records, and the band released the album through its own label Monkeywrench Records in the United States and through Universal Music Group internationally. Pearl Jam reached a deal with Target to be the exclusive big-box store retailer for the album in the United States. The album also saw release through the band's official website, independent record stores, online retailers, and iTunes.[109][110] In an interview McCready revealed that Pearl Jam may finish the Backspacer outtakes in the next six months,[111] and told San Diego radio station KBZT that the band may release an EP in 2010 consisting of those songs, while Vedder instead suggested that the songs may be used for the band's next studio album.[112]In August 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Virgin Festival,[113] the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival,[114] and played five shows in Europe and three in North America.[115][116][117] In October 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Austin City Limits Music Festival.[118] Later in October on Halloween night, the band played in what was the last performance at the Philadelphia Spectrum. An additional leg consisting of a tour of Oceania took place afterwards.[110] In May 2010, the band embarked on a month long tour starting with the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. The tour headed to the East Coast and ended May 21, 2010 at Madison Square Garden in New York.[119] A European tour took place in June and July 2010, where the band performed in Northern Ireland for the first time at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast.[120] In late October 2010, Pearl Jam performed at the 24th Annual Bridge School Benefit Concert at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California.[121] A live album, titled Live on Ten Legs, was released on January 17, 2011.[122] It is compilation of live tracks from their 2003 to 2010 world tours, and is a follow-up to Live on Two Legs, which consisted of songs recorded during their 1998 North American tour.[123]In March 2011, bassist Jeff Ament told Billboard that the band has 25 songs and they'd be heading into the studio in April to begin recording the follow-up to Backspacer.[124] On May 16, 2011, the band confirmed that they would play the Labor Day weekend at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre, East Troy, Wisconsin, followed by ten shows in Canada.[125]On September 8, 2011, the band released a new song titled "Ol".[126] On November 18, the band released Toronto 9.11.11a free live album available through the launch of Google Music.On November 21, 2011, as part of their PJ20 World Tour, Pearl Jam visited Costa Rica for the first time to a 30,000 crowd of fans at the New National Stadium.[127] The following month, the band announced a tour of Europe, which started in June 2012.[128]Compared with the other grunge bands of the early 1990s, Pearl Jams style is noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the classic rock music of the 1970s.[129] Pearl Jam has cited many punk rock and classic rock bands as influences, including The Who, Neil Young, and the Ramones.[130] Pearl Jams success has been attributed to its sound, which fuses "the riff-heavy stadium rock of the '70s with the grit and anger of '80s post-punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses."[6] Gossard's rhythm guitar style is known for its sense of beat and groove,[131] while McCready's lead guitar style, influenced by artists such as Jimi Hendrix,[132] has been described as "feel-oriented" and "rootsy."[133]Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less catchy. He said, "I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes."[1] By 1994s Vitalogy, the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music.[134] The bands 1996 album, No Code, was a deliberate break from the musical style of Ten. The songs on the album featured elements of garage rock, worldbeat, and experimentalism.[6] After 1998s Yield, which was somewhat of a return to the straightforward rock approach of the band's early work,[55] the band dabbled with experimental art rock on 2000s Binaural and folk rock elements on 2002s Riot Act. The bands 2006 album, Pearl Jam, was cited as a return to the bands early sound.[85][86] The band's 2009 album, Backspacer, contains elements of pop and New Wave.[105]Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a "Jim Morrison-like vocal growl."[135] Greg Prato of Allmusic said, "With his hard-hitting and often confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock."[136] Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal ("Alive", "Better Man") to social and political concerns ("Even Flow", "World Wide Suicide"). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals.[137] When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that."[138]While Nirvana had brought grunge to the mainstream in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam quickly outsold them,[139] and became "the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s" according to Allmusic.[6] Pearl Jam has been described as "modern rock radio's most influential stylists the workmanlike midtempo chug of songs like "Alive" and "Even Flow" just melodic enough to get moshers singing along."[140] The band inspired and influenced a number of bands, ranging from Silverchair to Puddle of Mudd and The Strokes.[141][142] Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries in the grunge scene such as Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden.[1]Pearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic Jim DeRogatis said in the aftermath of the band's battle with Ticketmaster that it "proved that a rock band which isn't comprised of greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime... it indicated that idealism in rock 'n' roll is not the sole province of those '60s bands enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."[143] Eric Weisbard of Spin said in 2001, "The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists."[15] In a 2005 USA Today reader's poll, Pearl Jam was voted the greatest American rock band of all time.[144] In April 2006, Pearl Jam was awarded the prize for "Best Live Act" in Esquire's Esky Music Awards. The blurb called Pearl Jam "the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their last."[145] Pearl Jam's fanbase following has been compared to that of the Grateful Dead's, with Rolling Stone magazine stating that Pearl Jam "toured incessantly and became one of rock's great arena acts, attracting a fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with marathon, true-believer shows in the vanishing spirit of Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2."[1]When asked about Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, "I think at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers werent always easy, but I think we found a way."[146] The band have also been credited for inspiring the indie rock scene of 90s-era urban Pakistan, that has since evolved into a rich rock music culture in the country.[147]Throughout its career, Pearl Jam has promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-choice sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues. The band has promoted an array of causes, including awareness of Crohn's disease, which Mike McCready suffers from, Ticketmaster venue monopolization and the environment and wildlife protection, among others.[148][149] Guitarist Stone Gossard has been active in environmental pursuits, and has been an advocate of Pearl Jam's carbon neutral policy, offsetting the band's environmental impact.[150] Vedder has advocated for the release of the West Memphis 3 for years and Damien Echols, a member of the three, shares a writing credit for the song "Army Reserve" (from Pearl Jam).[151]The band, and especially frontman Eddie Vedder, have been vocal supporters of the pro-choice movement. In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled "Reclamation", which detailed his views on abortion.[152] In an MTV Unplugged concert the same year, Vedder stood on a stool and wrote "PRO-CHOICE!" on his arm in protest when the band performed the song "Porch".[15] The band are members of a number of pro-choice organizations, including Choice USA and Voters for Choice.[149]As members of Rock the Vote and Vote for Change, the band has encouraged voter registration and participation in United States elections. Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000,[153] and Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, supporting the candidacy of John Kerry for U.S. President. In a Rolling Stone feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the magazine, "I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in."[154]Vedder sometimes comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy, and a number of his songs, including "Bu$hleaguer" and "World Wide Suicide", are openly critical of the Bush administration. At Lollapalooza 2007, Vedder spoke out against BP Amoco dumping effluent in Lake Michigan,[155] and at the end of "Daughter", he sang the lyrics "George Bush leave this world alone/George Bush find yourself another home". In the beginning of the second encore Vedder invited Iraq war veteran Tomas Young, the subject of the documentary Body of War, onto the stage to urge an end to the war. Young in turn introduced Ben Harper, who contributed vocals to "No More" and "Rockin' in the Free World".[156] The band has since discovered that some of the Bush-related lyrics were excised from the AT&T webcast of the event, and are questioning whether that constitutes censorship.[157] AT&T later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor Davie Brown Entertainment.[158]Pearl Jam has performed numerous benefit concerts in aid of charities. For example, the band headlined a Seattle concert in 2001 to support the United Nations' efforts to combat world hunger.[159] The band added a date at the Chicago House of Blues to its 2005 tour to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina; the concert proceeds were donated to Habitat for Humanity, the American Red Cross and the Jazz Foundation of America.[160]In 2011, Pearl Jam was named 2011 Planet Defenders by Rock The Earth for their environmental activism and their large-scale efforts to decrease their own carbon emissions.[161]   1 History

Jackie Chan, SBS, MBE[1] (born Chan Kong-sang, ; 7 April 1954)[2] is a Hong Kong actor, action choreographer, comedian, director, producer, martial artist, screenwriter, entrepreneur, singer, and stunt performer. In his movies, he is known for his acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, use of improvised weapons, and innovative stunts. He is one of the few actors that did all of his stunts in all of his films. Jackie Chan has been acting since the 1960s and has appeared in over 150 films.Chan has received stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As a cultural icon, Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, and video games. An operatically trained vocalist, Chan is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.Chan was born on 7 April 1954, in British Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang, to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. He was nicknamed Pao-pao Chinese: (literally meaning "Cannonball") because the high-energy child was always rolling around.[3] Since his parents worked for the French ambassador in Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district.[4]Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school. In 1960, his father immigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen.[4][5] Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics.[6] He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons.[7] After entering the film industry, Chan along with Sammo Hung got the opportunity to train in Hapkido under the grand master Jim Pal Kim, and Chan eventually attained a black belt.[8]He began his career by appearing in small roles at the age of five. At the age of eight, he appeared with some of his fellow "Little Fortunes", in the film Big and Little Wong Tin Bar (1962), with Li Li Hua playing his mother. Chan appeared with Li again the following year, in The Love Eterne (1963) and had a small role in King Hu's 1966 film, Come Drink with Me.[9] In 1971, after an appearance as an extra in another Kung Fu film, A Touch of Zen, Chan began his adult career in the film industry, initially signing to Chu Mu's Great Earth Film Company.[10] At the age of seventeen, he worked as a stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung (Chinese: ).[11] He received his first starring role later that year, in Little Tiger of Canton, which had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.[12] Due to the commercial failures of his early ventures into films and trouble finding stunt work, in 1975 Chan starred in a comedic adult film, All in the Family, which features Jackie Chan's first nude sex scene filmed. It is also the only film he has made to date that did not feature a single fight scene or stunt sequence.[13] Jackie Chan also appeared in a sex scene in the film The Shinjuku Incident, which was the only other nude scene that he ever filmed.Chan joined his parents in Canberra in 1976, where he briefly attended Dickson College and worked as a construction worker.[14] A fellow builder named Jack took Chan under his wing, earning Chan the nickname of "Little Jack" which was later shortened to "Jackie" and the name Jackie Chan has stuck with him ever since.[15] In addition, in the late 90s, Chan changed his Chinese name to Fong Si-lung (Chinese: ), since his father's original surname was Fong.[15]In 1976, Jackie Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan, a film producer in the Hong Kong film industry who had been impressed with Jackie's stuntwork. Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by Lo Wei. Lo had seen Chan's performance in the John Woo film Hand of Death (1976) and planned to model him after Bruce Lee with the film New Fist of Fury.[10] His stage name was changed to Sing Lung (Chinese: , also transcribed as Cheng Long,[16] literally "become the dragon") to emphasise his similarity to Bruce Lee, whose stage name was Lei Siu-lung (Chinese: , meaning "Little Dragon"). The film was unsuccessful because Chan was not accustomed to Lee's martial arts style. Despite the film's failure, Lo Wei continued producing films with similar themes, resulting in little improvement at the box office.[17]Chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, shot while he was loaned to Seasonal Film Corporation under a two-picture deal.[18] Under director Yuen Woo-ping, Chan was allowed complete freedom over his stunt work. The film established the comedic kung fu genre, and proved to be a breath of fresh air for the Hong Kong audience.[19] Chan then starred in Drunken Master, which finally propelled him to mainstream success.[20]Upon Chan's return to Lo Wei's studio, Lo tried to replicate the comedic approach of Drunken Master, producing Half a Loaf of Kung Fu and Spiritual Kung Fu.[15] He also gave Chan the opportunity to co-direct The Fearless Hyena with Kenneth Tsang. When Willie Chan left the company, he advised Jackie to decide for himself whether or not to stay with Lo Wei. During the shooting of Fearless Hyena Part II, Chan broke his contract and joined Golden Harvest, prompting Lo to blackmail Chan with triads, blaming Willie for his star's departure. The dispute was resolved with the help of fellow actor and director Jimmy Wang Yu, allowing Chan to stay with Golden Harvest.[18]Willie Chan had become Jackie's personal manager and firm friend, and has remained so for over 30 years. He was instrumental in launching Chan's international career, beginning with his first forays into the American film industry in the 1980s. His first Hollywood film was Battle Creek Brawl in 1980. Chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film The Cannonball Run, which grossed US$100million worldwide. Despite being largely ignored by audiences in favour of established American actors like Burt Reynolds, Chan was impressed by the outtakes shown at the closing credits, inspiring him to include the same device in his future films.After the commercial failure of The Protector in 1985, Chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into the US market, returning his focus to Hong Kong films.[17]Back in Hong Kong, Chan's films began to reach a larger audience in East Asia, with early successes in the lucrative Japanese market including The Young Master (1980) and Dragon Lord (1982). The Young Master went on to beat previous box office records set by Bruce Lee and established Chan as Hong Kong cinema's top star. With Dragon Lord, he began experimenting with elaborate stunt action sequences,[21] including a pyramid fight scene that holds the record for the most takes for a single sequence of scenes with 2900 takes,[22] and the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground.[23]Chan produced a number of action comedy films with his opera school friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. The three co-starred together for the first time in 1983 in Project A, which introduced a dangerous stunt-driven style of martial arts that won it the Best Action Design Award at the third annual Hong Kong Film Awards.[24] Over the following two years, the "Three Brothers" appeared in Wheels on Meals and the original Lucky Stars trilogy.[25][26] In 1985, Chan made the first Police Story film, a US-influenced action comedy in which Chan performed a number of dangerous stunts. It was named the "Best Film" at the 1986 Hong Kong Film Awards.[27] In 1987, Chan played "Asian Hawk," an Indiana Jones-esque character, in the film Armour of God. The film was Chan's biggest domestic box office success up to that point, grossing over HK $35million.[28]In 1988 Chan starred alongside Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao for the last time to date, in the film Dragons Forever. Hung co-directed with Corey Yuen, and the villain in the film was played by Yuen Wah, both of whom were fellow graduates of the China Drama Academy.In the late 1980s and early 90s, Chan starred in a number of successful sequels beginning with Police Story 2, which won the award for Best Action Choreography at the 1989 Hong Kong Film Awards. This was followed by Armour of God II: Operation Condor, and Police Story 3: Super Cop, for which Chan won the Best Actor Award at the 1993 Golden Horse Film Festival. In 1994, Chan reprised his role as Wong Fei-hung in Drunken Master II, which was listed in Time Magazine's All-Time 100 Movies.[29] Another sequel, Police Story 4: First Strike, brought more awards and domestic box office success for Chan, but did not fare as well in foreign markets.[30] Jackie Chan rekindled his Hollywood ambitions in the 1990s, but refused early offers to play villains in Hollywood films to avoid being typecast in future roles. For example, Sylvester Stallone offered him the role of Simon Phoenix, a criminal in the futuristic film Demolition Man. Chan declined and the role was taken by Wesley Snipes.[31]Chan finally succeeded in establishing a foothold in the North American market in 1995 with a worldwide release of Rumble in the Bronx, attaining a cult following in the United States that was rare for Hong Kong movie stars.[32] The success of Rumble in the Bronx led to a 1996 release of Police Story 3: Super Cop in the United States under the title Supercop, which grossed a total of US $16,270,600. Jackie's first huge blockbuster success came when he co-starred with Chris Tucker in the 1998 buddy cop action comedy Rush Hour,[33] grossing US$130million in the United States alone.[18] This film made a star of Jackie Chan, in Hollywood. As a publicity stunt, Jackie also wrote his autobiography in collaboration with Jeff Yang entitled I Am Jackie Chan.In 1998, Chan released his final film for Golden Harvest, Who Am I?. After leaving Golden Harvest in 1999, he produced and starred alongside Shu Qi in Gorgeous a romantic comedy that focused on personal relationships and featured only a few martial arts sequences.[34] Chan then helped create a PlayStation game in 2000 called Jackie Chan Stuntmaster, to which he lent his voice and performed the motion capture.[35] He continued his Hollywood success in 2000 when he teamed up with Owen Wilson in the Western action comedy Shanghai Noon which spawned the sequel Shanghai Knights (2003). He reunited with Chris Tucker for Rush Hour 2 (2001) which was an even bigger success than the original grossing $347 million worldwide. He experimented with special effects with The Tuxedo (2002) and The Medallion (2003) which were not as successful critically or commercially. In 2004 he teamed up with Steve Coogan in the big-budget loose adaptation of Jules Verne's Around the World in 80 Days.Despite the success of the Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon films, Chan became frustrated with Hollywood over the limited range of roles and lack of control over the film-making process.[36] In response to Golden Harvest's withdrawal from the film industry in 2003, Chan started his own film production company, JCE Movies Limited (Jackie Chan Emperor Movies Limited) in association with Emperor Multimedia Group (EMG).[18] His films have since featured an increasing number of dramatic scenes while continuing to succeed at the box office; examples include New Police Story (2004), The Myth (2005) and the hit film Rob-B-Hood (2006).[37][38][39]Chan's next release was the third instalment in the Rush Hour series: Rush Hour 3 in August 2007. It grossed US$255million.[40] However, it was a disappointment in Hong Kong, grossing only HK$3.5million during its opening weekend.[41]Filming of The Forbidden Kingdom (released in 2008), Chan's first onscreen collaboration with fellow Chinese actor Jet Li, was completed on 24 August 2007 and the movie was released in April 2008. The movie featured heavy use of effects and wires.[42][43] Chan voiced Master Monkey in Kung Fu Panda (released in June 2008), appearing with Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, and Angelina Jolie.[44] In addition, he has assisted Anthony Szeto in an advisory capacity for the writer-director's film Wushu, released on 1 May 2008. The film stars Sammo Hung and Wang Wenjie as father and son.[45]In November 2007, Chan began filming Shinjuku Incident, a dramatic role featuring no martial arts sequences with director Derek Yee, which sees Chan take on the role of a Chinese immigrant in Japan.[46] The film was released on 2 April 2009. According to his blog, Chan discussed his wishes to direct a film after completing Shinjuku Incident, something he has not done for a number of years.[47] The film is expected to be the third in the Armour of God series, and has a working title of Armour of God III: Chinese Zodiac. Chan had completed shooting the movie and will be released on 12 December 2012.[48] Because the Screen Actors Guild did not go on strike, Chan started shooting his next Hollywood movie The Spy Next Door at the end of October in New Mexico.[49] In The Spy Next Door, Chan plays an undercover agent whose cover is blown when he looks after the children of his girlfriend. In Little Big Soldier, Chan stars, alongside Leehom Wang as a soldier in the Warring States Period in China. He is the lone survivor of his army and must bring a captured enemy soldier Leehom Wang to the capital of his province.On 22 June 2009, he left Los Angeles to begin filming The Karate Kid, a remake of the 1984 original, in Beijing.[50] The film was released in America on 11 June 2010 and sees Chan's first dramatic American film. In the film, he plays Mr. Han, a kung fu master and maintenance man who teaches Jaden Smith's character, Dre, kung-fu so he can defend himself from school bullies. In Chan's next movie, Shaolin, he plays the cook of the temple instead of one of the major characters.His 100th movie 1911 was released on 26 September 2011. He is the co-director, executive producer, and lead star of the movie.[51] While Chan has directed over ten films over his career, this is his first directorial work in over ten years, since Jackie Chan's Who Am I? in 1998. 1911 premiered in North America on 14 October.[52]Chan won the Favorite Buttkicker award at the Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards in 2011 for The Karate Kid.[53] While at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, Chan announced that he was retiring from action films citing that he was getting too old for the genre. He later clarified that he would not be completely retiring from action films, but would be performing fewer stunts and taking care of his body more.[54]In 1982, Jackie Chan married Lin Feng-Jiao (aka Joan Lin), a Taiwanese actress. That same year, the two had a son, singer and actor Jaycee Chan.[36] Elaine Ng Yi-Lei had a daughter, Etta, in 1999, and claimed Chan was the father; Chan admitted the affair, but did not formally acknowledge her as his daughter.[55][56][57] Chan is a Buddhist.[58][59]He speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, American Sign Language, and English, and also speaks some German, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, and Thai.[60]When he was 9 and 16 years of age, he lived in Thailand for a short period of time. During that time, he learned boxing from a former professional boxer who had a broken leg.[61]In 2009, Chan received an honorary doctorate from the University of Cambodia.[62][63]Chan is an avid soccer fan and supports the Hong Kong National Football Team, England National Football Team, and Manchester City.[64]Jackie Chan has performed most of his own stunts throughout his film career, which are choreographed by the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. He has stated in interviews that the primary inspiration for his more comedic stunts were films such as The General directed by and starring Buster Keaton, who was also known to perform his own stunts. Since its establishment in 1983, Chan has used the team in all his subsequent films to make choreographing easier, given his understanding of each member's abilities.[65] Chan and his team undertake many of the stunts performed by other characters in his films, shooting the scenes so that their faces are obscured.[66]The dangerous nature of his stunts makes it difficult for Chan to get insurance, especially in the United States, where his stunt work is contractually limited.[66] Chan holds the Guinness World Record for "Most Stunts by a Living Actor", which emphasizes "no insurance company will underwrite Chan's productions in which he performs all his own stunts".[67] In addition, he holds an unrecognised record for the most number of takes for a single shot in a film, having shot over 2900 retakes for a complex scene involving a Jianzi game in Dragon Lord.[68]Chan has been injured numerous times attempting stunts; many of them have been shown as outtakes or as bloopers during the closing credits of his films. He came closest to death filming Armour of God, when he fell from a tree and fractured his skull. Over the years, Chan has dislocated his pelvis and broken his fingers, toes, nose, both cheekbones, hips, sternum, neck, ankle, and ribs on numerous occasions.[69][70] Promotional materials for Rumble in the Bronx emphasised that Chan performed all of the stunts, and one version of the movie poster even diagrammed his many injuries.Jackie Chan created his screen persona as a response to Bruce Lee, and the numerous imitators who appeared before and after Lee's death. In contrast to Lee's characters, who were typically stern, morally upright heroes, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular guys (often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends or families) who always triumph in the end despite the odds.[15] Additionally, Chan has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of Lee's: where Lee held his arms wide, Chan holds his tight to the body; where Lee was loose and flowing, Chan is tight and choppy. Despite the success of the Rush Hour series, Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie, nor understands American humour.[71]In recent years, the ageing Chan grew tired of being typecast as an action hero, prompting him to act with more emotion in his latest films.[72] In New Police Story, he portrayed a character suffering from alcoholism and mourning his murdered colleagues.[73] To further shed the image of Mr. Nice Guy, Chan played an anti-hero for the first time in Rob-B-Hood starring as Thongs, a burglar with gambling problems.[74]In 2000, Chan hosted a fictionalised version of himself in the animated series Jackie Chan Adventures, which ran until 2005.[75]In July 2008, the BTV reality television series entitled The Disciple(lit. "Disciple of the Dragon") concluded. The series was produced by, and featured Jackie Chan. The aim of the program was to find a new star, skilled in acting and martial arts, to become Chan's "successor" and student in filmmaking. Contestants were trained by Jackie Chan Stunt Team members Alan Wu and He Jun and competed in various fields, including explosion scenes, high-altitude wire-suspension, gunplay, car stunts, diving, obstacles courses etc.The regular judges on the program were He Ping, Wu Yue and Cheng Pei Pei. Guest judges include Stanley Tong, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. The "Finals" began on 5 April 2008, with 16 contestants remaining, and concluded on 26 June 2008. Amongst those in attendance were Tsui Hark, John Woo, Ng See Yuen and Yu Rongguang.The winner of the series was Jack Tu (Tu Sheng Cheng). Along with runners up Yang Zheng and Jerry Liau, Tu is now set to star in three modern Chinese action films, one of which was scripted by Chan, and all three will be co-produced by Chan and his company JCE Movies Limited. The films will be entitled Speedpost 206, Won't Tell You and Tropical Tornado and will be directed by Xie Dong, Jiang Tao and Cai Rong Hui. All 16 finalists will be given the opportunity to work on the films, or to join the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. Production on the first film is due to begin in September 2008. In addition, the finalists will be given roles in a forthcoming BTV action series.[76][77][78]Jackie Chan had vocal lessons whilst at the Peking Opera School in his childhood. He began producing records professionally in the 1980s and has gone on to become a successful singer in Hong Kong and Asia. He has released 20 albums since 1984 and has performed vocals in Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Taiwanese and English. He often sings the theme songs of his films, which play over the closing credits. Chan's first musical recording was "Kung Fu Fighting Man", the theme song played over the closing credits of The Young Master (1980).[79] At least 10 of these recordings have been released on soundtrack albums for the films.[73][80] His Cantonese song Story of a Hero () (theme song of Police Story) was selected by the Royal Hong Kong Police and incorporated into their recruitment advertisement in 1994.[81]Chan voiced the character of Shang in the Chinese release of the Walt Disney animated feature, Mulan (1998). He also performed the song "I'll Make a Man Out of You", for the film's soundtrack. For the US release, the speaking voice was performed by B.D. Wong and the singing voice was done by Donny Osmond.In 2007, Chan recorded and released the song "We Are Ready", the official one-year countdown song to the 2008 Summer Olympics. He performed the song at a ceremony marking the one-year countdown to the 2008 Summer Paralympics.[82]The day before the Beijing Olympics opened, Chan released one of the two official Olympics albums, Official Album for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games Jackie Chan's Version, which featured a number of special guest appearances.[83] Chan, along with Andy Lau, Liu Huan and Wakin (Emil) Chau, performed "Hard to Say Goodbye", the farewell song for the 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.[84]Jackie Chan has received worldwide recognition for his acting, having won several awards including an Innovator Award from the American Choreography Awards and a lifetime achievement award from the Taurus World Stunt Awards.[85] He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars.[86] Despite considerable box office success in The Northsouth Territories, Chan's American films have been criticised with regard to their action choreography. Reviewers of Rush Hour 2, The Tuxedo, and Shanghai Knights criticised the toning down of Chan's fighting scenes, citing less intensity compared to his earlier films.[87][88][89] The comedic value of his films is questioned; some critics stated it can be childish at times.[90]Chan is a cultural icon, having been referenced in Ash's song "Kung Fu", Heavy Vegetable's "Jackie Chan Is a Punk Rocker", Leehom Wang's "Long Live Chinese People", as well as in "Jackie Chan" by Frank Chickens, and television shows Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, Celebrity Deathmatch and Family Guy. He has been the inspiration for manga such as Dragon Ball (including a character with the alias "Jackie Chun"),[91] the character Lei Wulong in Tekken and the fighting-type Pokmon Hitmonchan.[92][93][94] In addition, Jackie Chan has a sponsorship deal with Mitsubishi Motors. As a result, Mitsubishi cars can be found in a number of Jackie Chan films. Furthermore, Mitsubishi honoured Chan by launching Evolution, a limited series of cars which he personally customised.[95][96][97]A number of video games have featured Jackie Chan. Before Stuntmaster, Chan already had a game of his own, Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu, released in 1990 for the PC-Engine and NES. In 1995, Chan was featured in the arcade fighting game Jackie Chan The Kung-Fu Master. In addition, a series of Japanese Jackie Chan games were released on the MSX by Pony, based on several of his films (Project A, Project A 2, Police Story, The Protector and Wheels On Meals).[98]Chan has always wanted to be a role model to children, remaining popular with them due to his good-natured acting style. He has generally refused to play villains and has almost never used the word "fuck" in his films (He's only said that word in two films, The Protector and Burn, Hollywood, Burn), but in Rush Hour, in an attempt to be "cool" and imitate his partner Carter, who said "What's up, my nigga?" to a club of black men, he said the same thing when Carter was in another room and they all attacked him, so he had to pull out his fighting skills to beat them down and escape.[99] Chan's greatest regret in life is not having received proper education,[100] inspiring him to fund educational institutions around the world. He funded the construction of the Jackie Chan Science Centre at the Australian National University[101] and the establishment of schools in poor regions of China.[102]Chan is a spokesperson for the Government of Hong Kong, appearing in public service announcements. In a Clean Hong Kong commercial, he urged the people of Hong Kong to be more considerate with regards to littering, a problem that has been widespread for decades.[103] Furthermore, in an advertisement promoting nationalism, he gave a short explanation of the March of the Volunteers, the national anthem of the People's Republic of China.[104] When Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005, Chan participated in the opening ceremony.[105] In the United States, Chan appeared alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in a government advert to combat copyright infringement and made another public service announcement with Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca to encourage people, especially Asians, to join the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.[106][107]Construction has begun on a Jackie Chan museum in Shanghai. Work began in July 2008, and although it was scheduled to be completed on October 2009, construction continues as of January 2010.[108]During a news conference in Shanghai on 28 March 2004, Chan referred to the recently concluded Republic of China presidential election, 2004 in Taiwan, in which Democratic Progressive Party candidates Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu were re-elected as President and Vice-President as "the biggest joke in the world."[109] Chan's comments were criticised by Parris Chang, a Taiwanese legislator and senior member of the DPP, who called for the government of Taiwan to take punitive steps against Chan for his comments, such as banning his movies and barring him the right to visit Taiwan.[110] Some 50 police and security personnel were required to separate protesters from Chan, as they were attempting to spit at him when he arrived at Taipei airport for a charity sponsored by cable TV channel TVBS on 18 June 2008.[111] Chan insisted that his remarks were not intended to insult the people of Taiwan.[112]Referring to his participation in the torch relay for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Chan spoke out against demonstrators who disrupted the relay several times attempting to draw attention to a wide-ranging number of grievances against the Chinese government, including China's human rights record and the political status of Taiwan. He warned that he would lash out against anyone planning to stop him from carrying the Olympic Torch, saying, "Demonstrators better not get anywhere near me." In addition, Chan felt that the protesters were publicity seekers. "They are doing it for no reason. They just want to show off on the TV," he said. "They know, 'if I can get the torch, I can go on the TV for the world news'." Chan felt the country was trying to improve and the Olympics is a chance for the country to open up and learn from the outside world and vice versa. "We are not right about everything. Things are getting better in China but we can change and are changing. We want to learn from the rest of the world as well as teach others about our ways and our culture."[113]On 18 April 2009, during a panel discussion at the annual Boao Forum for Asia titled "Tapping into Asia's Creative Industry Potential," Chan said "...in the 10 years after Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, I can gradually see, I'm not sure if it's good to have freedom or not."[114] Chan went on to say, "If you're too free, you're like the way Hong Kong is now. It's very chaotic. Taiwan is also chaotic." He also added, "I'm gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled. If we're not being controlled, we'll just do what we want." Chan however complained about the quality of Chinese goods, saying, "...a Chinese TV might explode."[115] but refrained from criticising the Chinese government for banning his 2009 film Shinjuku Incident.[116] Chan's comments prompted an angry response from some legislators and other prominent figures in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Hong Kong Legislator Leung Kwok-hung said that Chan "insulted the Chinese people. Chinese people aren't pets."[117] The Hong Kong Tourism Board stated that it had received 164 comments and complaints from the public over Chan's remarks.[118] A spokesman for Chan told reporters that the actor was referring to freedom in the entertainment industry rather than Chinese society at large and that certain people with "ulterior motives deliberately misinterpreted what he said."[119]On 24 August 2010, Chan tweeted about the botched rescue operation on the Manila hostage crisis that left 8 Hong Kong tourists dead. Although saddened by the news, he also tweeted "If they killed the guy sooner, they will say why not negotiate first? If they negotiate first, they ask why not kill the guy sooner?"[120][121][122][123] Chan's comments caused outrage in Hong Kong. Several anti-Jackie Chan groups were set up on Facebook with tens of thousands of supporters. Some fellow actors and directors told local newspapers that they were also upset by his remarks. Chan reportedly has business interests in the Philippines. He issued a statement on 27 August 2010 apologising for his comments and claiming that his assistant who helped him post the tweets had misunderstood the meaning of his original message.[124]In addition to his film production and distribution company, JCE Movies Limited, Jackie Chan also owns or co-owns the production companies JC Group China, Jackie & Willie Productions[125] (with Willie Chan) and Jackie & JJ Productions.[126]Chan has also put his name to Jackie Chan Theater International, a cinema chain in China, co-run by Hong Kong company Sparkle Roll Group Ltd. The firstJackie Chan-Yaolai International Cinemaopened in February 2010, and is claimed to be the largest cinema complex in China, with 17 screens and 3,500 seats. Chan expressed his hopes that the size of the venue would afford young, non-commercial directors the opportunity to have their films screened. 15 further cinemas in the chain are planned for 2010, throughout Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, with a potential total of 65 cinemas throughout the country proposed.[127][128]In 2004, Chan launched his own line of clothing, which bears a Chinese dragon logo and the English word "Jackie", or the initials "JC".[129] Chan also has a number of other branded businesses.

He has campaigned for conservation, against animal abuse and has promoted disaster relief efforts for floods in mainland China and the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.[5][131][132] In June 2006, he announced the donation of half his assets to charity upon his death, citing his admiration of the effort made by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to help those in need.[133] On 10 March 2008, Chan was the guest of honour for the launch, by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, of the Jackie Chan Science Centre at the John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University in Canberra.

Though he did not understand a word of Tamil, Chan was touched by the Indian community's love for him and his films, and was impressed with the movie Dasavathaaram, expressing a keen interest in working with the star of the film, Kamal Hassan. Hassan himself reciprocated the desire to work with the action superstar, urging Chan to keep his promise of working with him on a possible film project.Following the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Chan donated RMB 10million to help those in need. In addition, he is planning to make a film about the Chinese earthquake to raise money for survivors.In response to the 2011 Thoku earthquake and tsunami, Jackie Chan and fellow Hong Kong-based celebrities, including American rapper Jin, headlined a special three-hour charity concert, titled Artistes 311 Love Beyond Borders, on 1 April 2011 to help with Japan's disaster recovery effort,[135] where Jackie Chan addressed the victims of the earthquake and tsunami by saying: "You will not be alone, we will be by your side".[136] The concert raised over $3.3million dollars in just three hours for disaster relief.[137]Chan also holds guest lectures at the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art of Fudan University, Shanghai.Founded in 1988, the Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation offers scholarships and active help to Hong Kong's young people through a variety of worthy causes. Over the years, the foundation has broadened its scope to include provision of medical services, aid to victims of natural disaster or illness, and projects where the major beneficiaries are Hong Kong people or organisations. Major donation projects of The Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation:The Dragon's Heart Foundation was founded in 2005 to fulfill the desperate needs of children and the elderly in remote areas of China. Since 2005, the Dragon's Heart Foundation has built over a dozen schools, provided books, fees, and uniforms, and has raised millions of dollars to give much-needed educational opportunities for the poor. In addition, the Dragon's Heart Foundation provides for the elderly with donations of warm clothing, wheelchairs, and other items. Jackie often travels to the remote locations to attend groundbreakings or school openings, and to lend support and encouragement.

This is a list of phenomena specific to the Internet, such as popular themes and catchphrases, images, viral videos, and more. Such fads and sensations grow rapidly on the Internet because its instant communication facilitates word of mouth. In the early days of the Internet, such content was primarily spread via email or Usenet discussion communities. Messageboards and newsgroups were also popular because they allowed a simple method for people to share information or memes with a diverse population of internet users. They encourage communication between people, and thus between meme sets, that do not normally come in contact. Furthermore, they actively promote meme-sharing within the messageboard or newsgroup population by asking for feedback, comments, opinions, etc. Another factor in the increased meme transmission observed over the internet is its interactive nature. Print matter, radio, and television are all essentially passive experiences requiring the reader, listener, or viewer to perform all necessary cognitive processing; in contrast the social nature of the Internet allows phenomena to propagate more readily. Many phenomena are also spread via web search engines, internet forums, social networking sites, social news sites, and video hosting services. Search engines allow memes to be located even with obscure information. Without search engines, most internet memes would languish in obscurity on isolated or hard-to-reach personal pages linked to only a few other documents. While large companies attempting to promote memes favoring their own products would still flourish, much of the Internet's meme-spreading capacity would not exist without search engines.[1][2]1 Advertising2 Animation and comics3 Email4 Films5 Games6 Images7 Music8 Trading or sales9 Videos10 Other11 See also12 References13 External linksBlendtec  The blender product, claimed by its creator Tom Dickson to be the most powerful blender, is featured in a series of YouTube videos, "Will It Blend?" where numerous food and non-food items are used within the blender.[3]Cooks Source infringement controversy  An advertising-supported publication's dismissive response to copyright infringement complaint causes online backlash.[4]Elf Yourself (2006) and its related Scrooge Yourself (2007) are both interactive websites created by Jason Zada and Evolution Bureau for OfficeMax's holiday season advertising campaign. Elf Yourself allows visitors to upload images of themselves or their friends, see them as dancing elves,[5][6] and includes options to post the created video to other sites or save it as a personalized mini-film.[7] According to ClickZ, visiting the Elf Yourself site "has become an annual tradition that people look forward to".[8] While not selling any one specific product, the two were created to raise consumer awareness of the sponsoring firm.[9]Embrace Life  A public service announcement for seatbelt advocacy made for a local area of the United Kingdom that achieved a million hits on its first two weeks on YouTube in 2010.[10][11]FreeCreditReport.com  A series of TV commercials that were posted on the Internet; many spoofs of the commercials were made and posted on YouTube.[12]HeadOn  A June 2006 advertisement for a homeopathic product claimed to relieve headaches. Ads featured the tagline, "HeadOn. Apply directly to the forehead", stated three times in succession, accompanied by a video of a model using the product without ever directly stating the product's purpose. The ads were successively parodied on sites such as YouTube and rapper Lil Jon even made fun of it.[13]Horse ebooks  An automated Twitter account featuring amusingly garbled tweets, linked to a website selling low-quality e-books about horses. The account has become the inspiration for fan art and merchandise, as well as attempts to identify its anonymous creator.[14]Little Darth Vader  An advertisement by Volkswagen featuring young Max Page dressed in a Darth Vader costume running around his house trying to use "The Force". It was released on the Internet a few days prior to Super Bowl XLV in 2011, and quickly became popular.[15]LowerMyBills.com  Banner ads from this mortgage company feature endless loops of cowboys, women, aliens, and office workers dancing.[16][17]The Man Your Man Could Smell Like  A television commercial starring Isaiah Mustafa reciting a quick, deadpan monologue while shirtless about how "anything is possible" if men use Old Spice. It eventually led to a popular viral marketing campaign which had Mustafa responding to various Internet comments in short YouTube videos on Old Spice's YouTube channel.[18]"Nope, Chuck Testa"  A local commercial made for Ojai Valley Taxidermy, owned by Chuck Testa, suggesting that the stuffed creatures were alive until Testa appeared, saying "Nope, Chuck Testa!"; the ad soon went viral.[19][20]Shake Weight  Infomercial clips of the modified dumbbell went viral as a result of the product's sexually suggestive nature.[21]Animutations  Early Flash-based animations, pioneered by Neil Cicierega in 2001, typically featuring foreign language songs (primary Japanese, such as "Yatta"), set to random pop-culture images. The form is said to have launched the use of Flash for inexpensive animations that are now more common on the Internet.[22][23][24]Axe Cop  Initially a web comic series with stories created by 5-year-old Malachai Nicolle and drawn into comic form by his 29-year-old brother Ethan; the series gained viral popularity on the Internet due to the vividness and non-sequitor nature of Malachai's imagination, and has led to physical publication and an upcoming series of animated shorts in the 2012-2013 season for the Fox Television Network.[25][26][27]Badger Badger Badger  A hypnotic loop of animal calisthenics set to the chant of "badger, badger, badger", created by Jonti "Weebl" Picking."Caramelldansen"  A spoof from the Japanese visual novel opening Popotan that shows the two main characters doing a hip swing dance with their hands over their heads imitating rabbit ears, while the background song plays the sped up version of the song Caramelldansen sung by the Swedish music group Caramell. Also known as Caramelldansen Speedycake Remix or Uma uma dance in Japan, the song was parodied by artists and fans who then copy the animation and include characters from other anime performing the dance.[28][29][30]Charlie the Unicorn  A three-part series of videos involving a unicorn who is repeatedly hoodwinked by two other unnamed unicorns, colored blue and pink, who take him on elaborate adventures in order to steal his belongings or cause him physical harm.[31]Dancing baby  A 3D-rendered dancing baby that first appeared in 1996 by the creators of Character Studio for 3D Studio MAX, and became something of a late 1990s cultural icon in part due to its exposure on world wide commercials, editorials about Character Studio, and the popular television series Ally McBeal.[32]Happy Tree Friends  A series of Flash cartoons featuring cute cartoon animals experiencing violent and gruesome accidents.[33]Homestar Runner  A Flash animated Internet cartoon by Mike Chapman and Craig Zobel, created in 1996 and popularized in 2000, along with Matt Chapman. The cartoon contains many references to popular culture from the 1980s and 1990s, including video games, television, and popular music.[34]Joe Cartoon  Alias of online cartoonist Joe Shields. Best known for his interactive Flash animations Frog in a Blender[35] and Gerbil in a Microwave,[36] released in 1999.[37] Two of the first Flash cartoons to receive fame on the Internet.[38]Loituma Girl (also known as Leekspin)  Loop of Orihime Inoue from Bleach twirling a leek set to the music of Loituma.[39]My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic  Hasbro's 2010 animated series to revive its toy line was discovered by members of 4chan and subsequently spawned a large adult, mostly male fanbase calling themselves "bronies" and creating numerous Internet memes and mashups based on elements from the show.[40][41]Nyan Cat  A YouTube video of an animated flying cat, set to a Utau song.[42]Rage comics  A large set of pre-drawn images including crudely drawn stick figures, clip art, and other art work, typically assembled through website generators, to allow anyone to assemble a comic and post to various websites and boards; the New York Times claims thousands of these are created daily.[43] Typically these are drawn in response to a real-life event that has angered the comic's creator, hence the term "rage comics", but comics assembled for any other purpose can also be made. Certain images from rage comics are known by specific titles, such as "trollface" (a widely grinning man), "forever alone" (a man crying to himself), or "rage guy" (a man shouting "FUUUUU...").Salad Fingers  A Flash animation series surrounding a schizophrenic green man in a desolate world populated mostly by deformed, functionally mute people.[44]This Land  Flash animation produced by JibJab featuring cartoon faces of George W. Bush and John Kerry singing a parody of "This Land is Your Land" that spoofs the United States presidential election, 2004. The video became a viral hit and viewed by over 100 million, leading to the production of other JibJab hits, including Good to be in D.C. and Big Box Mart.[45]Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny  A lethal battle royal between many notable real and fictitious characters from popular culture. Set to a song of the same name, written and performed by Neil Cicierega under his musician alias, "Lemon Demon."[46]Weebl and Bob  A series of flash cartoons created by Jonti Picking featuring two egg-shaped characters that like pie and speak in a virtually incoherent manner.[47]xkcd  A webcomic created by Randall Munroe, popularized on the Internet due to a high level of math-, science- and geek-related humor,[48] with certain jokes being reflected in real-life, such as using Wikipedia's {{citation needed}} tag on real world signs[49] or the addition of an audio preview for YouTube comments.[50]Bill Gates Email Beta Test  An email chain-letter that first appeared in 1997 and was still circulating as recently as 2007. The message claims that America Online and Microsoft are conducting a beta test and for each person you forward the email to, you will receive a payment from Bill Gates of more than $200. Realistic contact information for a lawyer appears in the message.[51][52]Craig Shergold  a British former cancer patient who is most famous for receiving an estimated 350 million greeting cards, earning him a place in the Guinness Book of World Records in 1991 and 1992. Variations of the plea for greeting cards sent out on his behalf in 1989 are still being distributed through the Internet, making the plea one of the most persistent urban legends.[53]Goodtimes virus  An infamous, fraudulent virus warning that first appeared in 1994. The email claimed that an email virus with the subject line "Good Times" was spreading, which would "send your CPU into a nth-complexity infinite binary loop", among other dire predictions.[54][55]Lighthouse and naval vessel urban legend  Purportedly an actual transcript of an increasingly heated radio conversation between a U.S. Navy ship and a Canadian who insists the naval vessel change a collision course, ending in the punchline. This urban legend first appeared on the Internet in its commonly quoted format in 1995, although versions of the story predate it by several decades.[56] It continues to circulate; the Military Officers Association of America reported in 2011 that it is forwarded to them an average of three times a day.[57] The Navy has a page specifically devoted to pointing out that many of the ships named weren't even in service at the time.[58]MAKE.MONEY.FAST  One of the first spam messages that was spread primarily through Usenet, or even earlier BBS systems, in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The original email is attributed to an individual who used the name "Dave Rhodes", who may or may not have existed.[59] The message is a classic pyramid scheme  you receive an email with a list of names and are asked to send $5 by postal mail to the person whose name is at the top of the list, add your own name to the bottom, and forward the updated list to a number of other people.[60]Mouse Ball Replacement Memo  A memorandum circulated to IBM field service technicians detailing the proper procedures for replacing mouse balls, yet filled with a number of sexual innuendos. The memo actually was written by someone at IBM and distributed to technicians, but it was distributed as a corporate in-joke, and not as an actual policy or procedure. On the Internet, the memo can be traced as far back as 1989.[61]Neiman Marcus Cookie recipe  An email chain-letter dating back to the early 1990s, but originating as Xeroxlore, in which a person tells a story about being ripped off for over $200 for a cookie recipe from Neiman Marcus. The email claims the person is attempting to exact revenge by passing the recipe out for free.[62][63]Nigerian Scam/419 scam  A mail scam attempt popularized by the ability to send millions of emails. The scam claims the sender is a high-ranking official of Nigeria with knowledge of a large sum of money or equivalent goods that they cannot claim but must divest themselves of it; to do so, they claim to require a smaller sum of money up front to access the sum to send to the receiver. The nature of the scam has mutated to be from any number of countries, high-ranking persons, barristers, or relationships to said people.[64]The Blair Witch Project  The film's producers used Internet marketing to create the impression that the documentary-style horror film featured real, as opposed to fictional, events.[65]Brokeback Mountain inspired many online parody trailers.[66]Cloverfield  Paramount Pictures used a viral marketing campaign to promote this monster movie.[67]Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus  The theatrical trailer released in mid-May 2009 became a viral hit, scoring over one million hits on MTV.com and another 300,000 hits on YouTube upon launch, prompting brisk pre-orders of the DVD.[68]Re-cut/Mashup Movie Trailers  User-made trailers for established films, using scenes, voice-overs, and music, to alter the appearance of the film's true genre or meaning or to create a new, apparently seamless, film. Examples include casting the thriller-drama The Shining into a romantic comedy, or using footage from the respective films to create Robocop vs. Terminator.[69][70]RedLetterMedia/Mr. Plinkett Reviews  Independent filmmaker Mike Stoklasa's long, in-depth critical reviews of the Star Wars prequel trilogy and several other large budget films, re-enacted under his crotchety "Mr. Plinkett" persona, became highly popular through word-of-mouth on the Internet.[71]Snakes on a Plane  Attracted attention a year before its planned release, and before any promotional material was released, due to the film's working title, its seemingly absurd premise, and the piquing of actor Samuel L. Jackson's interest to work on the film. Producers of the film responded to the Internet buzz by adding several scenes and dialogue imagined by the fans.[72]Marble Hornets is a documentary-style horror, suspense short film series based on alternate reality experiences of the Slenderman tale. It follows the story and discoveries made by student filmers of the Marble Hornets project, and has its basis in the tale before spinning off into an alternate reality game (ARG), which are interactive narratives that use the real world as their playing field, bringing the what if? ideas that drive many other creators of fiction. The series tends to utilize the This Is Not A Game aesthetic, in which the world created by the game should be as real as possible; therefore any location mentioned should be real, etc. Marble Hornets was instrumental in codifying parts of the Slender Man mythos, but is not part of the intercontinuity crossover that includes many of the blogs and vlogs that followed it, although MH does feature in other canons as either a chronicle of real events or a fictional series.[73][74][75]The Room (2003) - Written, produced, directed, and starring Tommy Wiseau, the low budget independent film is considered one of the worst films ever made, but though social media and interest from comedians, gained a large number of fans of movie while further becoming a popular source for memes based on some of the poorly delivered lines in the movie, such as "You're tearing me apart, Lisa!" [76][77]Take This Lollipop (2011) is an interactive horror short film and Facebook app, written and directed by Jason Zada to personalize and underscore the dangers inherent in posting too much personal information about oneself on the Internet. Information gathered from a viewer's Facebook profile by the film's app, used once and then deleted, makes the film different for each viewer.[78][79][80]"All your base are belong to us"  Badly translated English from the opening cutscene of the European Sega Genesis/Mega Drive version of the 1989 arcade game Zero Wing, which has become a catchphrase, inspiring videos and other derivative works.[81]Giant Enemy Crab The meme originated during the demonstration of Genji: Days of the Blade at the Sony E3 2006 press conference. The producer Bill Ritch claimed that Genji 2's epic battles were based on "famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan." Almost immediately after this was spoken, the gameplay footage showed a boss battle against, in his own words, a "giant enemy crab." Popular memes originating from the Genji demonstration included the game features described such as "you attack its weak point for massive damage" and "real-time...weapon change," despite neither of these being at all new to video gaming, being staples of classic 1980s games such as Metroid. In IGN's E3 2006 wrap-up, they listed a number of Genji 2 quotes.[82]Leeroy Jenkins  A World of Warcraft player charges into a high-level dungeon with a distinctive cry of "Leeeeeeeerooooy... Jeeenkins!", ruining the meticulous attack plans of his group and getting them all killed.[83]Line Rider  A Flash game where the player draws lines that act as ramps and hills for a small rider on a sled.[84]I Love Bees  An alternate reality game that was spread virally after a one second mention inside a Halo 2 advertisement.

The Hunger Games is a 2012 American science fiction film directed by Gary Ross, based on the novel of the same name by Suzanne Collins. The film was produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik, with a screenplay by Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray. It stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland.[5]The story takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future in the nation of Panem, where boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 18 must participate in the Hunger Games, a televised annual event in which the "tributes" are required to fight to the death until there is one remaining victor. The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence), volunteers to take her younger sister's place in the games. Joined by her district's male tribute Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson), Katniss travels to the Capitol to train for the Hunger Games under the guidance of former victor Haymitch Abernathy (Harrelson).The film was released on March 21, 2012, in France[6] and in the US on March 23, 2012,[7] in both conventional theaters and digital IMAX theaters.[8] Japan received it last, on September 28. When the film released, it set records for opening day ($67.3 million) and opening weekend for a non-sequel.[9] At the time of its release, the film's opening weekend gross ($152.5million) was the third-largest of any movie in North America.[10] It is the first film since Avatar to remain in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends.[11] The movie was a massive box-office success by grossing $685 million worldwide against its budget of $78 million.[4] It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on August 18, 2012.[12]The Hunger Games received positive reviews, with praise for its themes and messages, as well as Lawrence's performance as Katniss. Like the novel, the film has attracted criticism for its similarities to other works, such as the Japanese novel Battle Royale, its film adaptation, and the Shirley Jackson short story "The Lottery." Collins' novel and screenplay draw on sources of inspiration such as the myth of Theseus, Roman gladiatorial games, reality television, and the desensitization of viewers to media coverage of real-life tragedy and war, not to think as just an audience member, "Because those are real people on the screen, and theyre not going away when the commercials start to roll."[13]Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, accompanied by their frequently drunk mentor and past victor, Haymitch Abernathy. He warns them about the "Career" tributes who train intensively at special academies and almost always win.During a TV interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta unexpectedly reveals his love for Katniss. She is outraged, believing it to be a ploy to gain audience support, as "sponsors" may provide in-Games gifts of food, medicine and tools. However, she discovers Peeta meant what he said.The televised Games begin with half of the tributes killed in the first few minutes; Katniss barely survives ignoring Haymitch's advice to run away from the melee over the tempting supplies and weapons strewn in front of a structure called the Cornucopia. Peeta forms an uneasy alliance with the four Careers. They later find Katniss and corner her up a tree. Rue, hiding in a nearby tree, draws her attention to a poisonous tracker jacker nest. Katniss drops it on her sleeping besiegers. They all scatter, except for Glimmer, who is killed by the insects. Hallucinating due to tracker jacker venom, Katniss is warned to run away by Peeta. Rue cares for Katniss until she recovers.Meanwhile, the alliance has gathered up all the supplies. Katniss has Rue draw them off, then destroys the stockpile by setting off the mines planted around it. Furious, Cato kills the boy assigned to guard it. Katniss frees Rue from a trap, then dodges a spear thrown by Marvel; it strikes Rue. Katniss kills Marvel, then comforts the dying Rue with a song. Afterward, she gathers and arranges flowers around the body. When this is televised, it sparks a riot in Rue's District 11. Panem President Snow summons Seneca Crane, the Gamemaker, to express his displeasure at the way the Games are turning out.Since Katniss and Peeta have been portrayed as "star-crossed lovers", Haymitch convinces Crane to make a rule change to avoid further unrest. It is announced that tributes from the same district can win as a pair. Upon hearing this, Katniss searches for Peeta and finds him with an infected sword wound in the leg. She pretends to be deeply in love with him and gains a sponsor's gift of soup. An announcer proclaims a feast, where the thing each survivor needs most will be provided. Peeta begs her not to risk getting him medicine. Katniss promises not to go, but after he falls asleep, she heads to the feast. Clove ambushes her, pins her, and gloats. Thresh, the other District 11 tribute, kills Clove after overhearing her tormenting Katniss about killing Rue. He spares Katniss in Rue's memory. The medicine works, keeping Peeta mobile.Foxface, the girl from District 5, dies from eating nightlock berries she stole from Peeta; neither knew they are poisonous. Without warning, Crane darkens the arena and unleashes a pack of hound-like creatures to speed things up. They kill Thresh. Katniss and Peeta flee to the roof of the Cornucopia, where they have to fight Cato. Katniss wounds Cato with an arrow and Peeta hurls him to the creatures below. Katniss shoots Cato to spare him a prolonged death. With Peeta and Katniss apparently victorious, the rule change allowing two winners is suddenly revoked. Peeta tells Katniss to shoot him. Instead, she gives him half of the nightlock. Before they can commit suicide, they are hastily proclaimed the victors of the 74th Hunger Games.Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made powerful enemies with her display of defiance. She and Peeta return home, while Crane is locked in a room with a bowl of nightlock berries, and President Snow ponders the situation.In March 2009, Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement for The Hunger Games with Nina Jacobson's production company Color Force, which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier,[25][26] reportedly for $200,000.[27] Alli Shearmur and Jim Miller, President and Senior Vice President of Motion Picture Production at Lionsgate, took charge of overseeing the production of the film, which they described as "an incredible property... a thrill to bring home to Lionsgate."[28] The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000  one of its largest ever[29]  for the film.[27][30] Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that "they [Lionsgate] had everyone but the valet call us" to help secure the franchise.[30] Lionsgate subsequently acquired tax breaks of $8million for shooting the film in North Carolina.[30] The production was eventually brought in under-budget at $78million.[31]Collins adapted the novel for film herself,[25] in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross.[32][33] The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel,[34] with Ross saying he "felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective", echoing Collins' presentation of the novel in the first person present.[35] Instead of Katniss' internal monologue about the Capitol's machinations, the screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience. Ross explained, "In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers manipulations... in the film, we can't get inside Katnisss head, but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game center and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was tonally important."[35] Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that "I thought that it was very interesting that there would be one generation [of Panem citizens] who knew that [the Games] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's really where the tension is".[36]The Gamemakers' control center, about which Katniss can only speculate in the novel, was also developed as a location, helping to remind the audience of the artificial nature of the arena. Ross commented that, "so much of the film happens in the woods that it's easy to forget this is a futuristic society, manipulating these events for the sake of an audience. The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room."[35] Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggan were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggan explained that "we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie? we wanted to find a way to introduce them without having to explain specifically and exactly what they were and the game room was a really great opportunity for us to be able to do that."[37]Lionsgate confirmed in March 2011 that about 30 actresses auditioned or read for the role of Katniss Everdeen, including Hailee Steinfeld, Abigail Breslin, Emma Roberts, Saoirse Ronan, Chlo Grace Moretz, Jodelle Ferland, Lyndsy Fonseca, Emily Browning, Shailene Woodley, and Kaya Scodelario.[3][38] On March 16, 2011 it was announced that Oscar nominee Jennifer Lawrence of the indie film Winter's Bone had landed the coveted role.[39] Ross described Lawrence as having "an incredible amount of self-assuredness, you got the sense that this girl knew exactly who she was. And then she came in and read for me and just knocked me out; I'd never seen an audition like that before in my life. It was one of those things where you just glimpse your whole movie in front of you."[37]Though Lawrence was 20 when filming began, four years older than the character,[40] Collins said that the role demanded "a certain maturity and power" and said she would rather the actress be older than younger.[41] She added that Lawrence was the "only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book" and that she had "every essential quality necessary to play Katniss."[42] Lawrence, a fan of the books, took three days to accept the role, initially intimidated by the size of the production.[3][43]Contenders for the role of Peeta other than Hutcherson included Alexander Ludwig (who was later cast as Cato), Hunter Parrish, Lucas Till, and Evan Peters.[44] Other actors considered for the role of Gale included David Henrie, Drew Roy, and Robbie Amell.[44] In April 2011, John C. Reilly was in talks with Lions Gate Entertainment to portray Haymitch Abernathy, former victor of a Hunger Games held years before and mentor to Katniss and Peeta.[45] The following month Lionsgate announced that the role had gone to Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson.[17] The casting of Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman, and Toby Jones as Claudius Templesmith, soon followed. Multiple-Golden Globe award winner Donald Sutherland completed the major characters, cast as President Coriolanus Snow in late May 2011.[46]Gary Ross became director in November 2010.[47][48] Fireman's Fund Insurance Company insured the production, but as part of the underwriting process insisted on a thorough risk analysis of hazards as diverse as wayward arrows, poison ivy, bears, bugs, and a chase across fast-running water.[49]Lawrence dyed her blonde hair dark for the part of Katniss.[50] She also underwent extensive training to get in shape for the role, including archery, rock and tree climbing, combat, running, parkour, and yoga,[51] and experienced an accident on the last day of her six week training phase, in which she hit a wall while running at full speed, but was not seriously injured. Other stars who dyed their hair for the movie include Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, and Liam Hemsworth as Gale.[3] Lionsgate hired archer (and Olympic bronze medalist) Khatuna Lorig to teach Lawrence how to shoot.[49]With an initial budget of $75million,[52] principal photography began near Brevard in Transylvania County in Western North Carolina in May 2011[53] and concluded on September 15, 2011, with a final budget reported as between $90 and $100million, reduced to $78million after subsidies.[1][3] Steven Soderbergh served as a second unit director,[54] and filmed much of the District 11 riot scene.[55] The movie was shot on film as opposed to digital due (in part) to the tightness of the schedule; as Ross said in an interview with The New York Times, "I didn't want to run the risk of the technical issues that often come with shooting digitally  we simply couldn't afford any delays."[56]Virtually all production photography took place in North Carolina, with Lionsgate receiving tax credits of around $8million from the state government to do so. Forbes magazine estimated that the state economy gained up to $60million from the production, with over 5,000 people employed as extras, crew and support staff.[57] Most outdoor scenes, both from the arena and from the outskirts of District 12, were filmed in DuPont State Forest; the Little River, with its multiple waterfalls, provided several locations for shooting the river running through the arena.[58] The production team built a walkway across the top of Triple Falls for Lawrence to run over the rapids during Katniss' pursuit by the Career tributes.[59]Many of the urban and interior locations, in the Capitol and elsewhere, were filmed in Shelby and Charlotte. Ross and production designer Phil Messina drew on the buildings of the 1939 New York World's Fair and symbols of political power including Tiananmen Square and Red Square, when designing the Capitol architecture, which they wanted "to be set in the future but have a sense of its own past... it's festive and alluring and indulgent and decadent but it also has to have the kind of might and power behind it".[60][61] For Katniss' neighborhood in District 12, the production team found Henry River Mill Village, an abandoned mill town which Ross said "just worked perfectly for the movie to evoke the scene"; Messina explained that "originally we talked about maybe building one house and the facade of the house next door and redressing it, and maybe doing some CG extensions... we ended up finding a whole abandoned mill town... it was absolutely perfect."[61]The film has been rated 12A by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) in the UK for "intense threat, moderate violence and occasional gory moments".[2] To achieve that rating, Lionsgate had to cut or substitute seven seconds of film by "digitally removing blood splashes and the sight of blood on wounds and weapons".[62] In the United States, the movie was granted a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)[63] for "intense violent thematic material and disturbing images  all involving teens"; as Collins had originally anticipated.[64]The soundtrack album for the The Hunger Games contains songs inspired by the film; only three of them appear in the film itself, during the closing credits.[65] The first single from the film's companion album, "Safe & Sound" by Taylor Swift featuring The Civil Wars, was released on December 23, 2011.[66] It reached number one on the iTunes overall charts in 12 hours.[citation needed] The music video for "Safe & Sound" was released on February 13, 2012. Along with separate songs from Swift and The Civil Wars, the soundtrack also features songs by The Decemberists, Arcade Fire, The Secret Sisters, Miranda Lambert featuring The Pistol Annies,[67] Neko Case,[68] Kid Cudi[67] Academy Award winner Glen Hansard,[67] The Low Anthem,[67] Punch Brothers,[67] Birdy,[67] Maroon 5, Jayme Dee,[67] and Carolina Chocolate Drops.[67] The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012.[69] The soundtrack track list was revealed on iTunes on February 13, 2012, and on the 14th "One Engine" was released as the second single. Jennifer Lawrence singing "Rue's Lullaby" was not included on the soundtrack. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, having sold 175,000 copies in its first week. It was the first since Michael Jackson's This Is It to debut at #1. It is one of just 16 soundtracks to grace the top slot in the history of the Top 200.Lionsgate originally announced that Danny Elfman and T-Bone Burnett would score The Hunger Games, with Burnett also acting as the film's executive music producer to produce songs for the soundtrack.[70] Due to scheduling conflicts, Elfman was replaced by James Newton Howard.[71] The score album was released on March 26, 2012.[72]Arcade Fire also contributed to the movie's original score. The group composed the grand, fascistic-inspired, ominous Panem national anthem, entitled "Horn of Plenty", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film.[73][74] "We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise," Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. "And there's an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It's like the Capitol's idea of itself, basically."[73][74] He further added that "it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [Hunger] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film."[73][74] Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to Spin Mobile, ""Horn of Plenty" pulls off the neat feat of sounding both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem. It still has one foot in the band's uncorrupted neighborhoods, but another is up on the podium at the end of Star Wars accepting an Olympic gold medal or something. Horns blare, a choir booms, strings swell, the martial percussion steals the show, and we just realized how much we love Big Brother."[75]The film also featured a rather obscure analog track from the 1970s composed by Laurie Spiegel for its "cornucopia scene."[76]The album reached a peak of 71st on the Canadian Albums Chart.[77]The Hunger Games received positive reviews. Based on 266 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 85% "Certified Fresh" rating and an average score of 7.2 out of 10. The site's consensus reads "thrilling and superbly acted, The Hunger Games captures the dramatic violence, raw emotion, and ambitious scope of its source novel".[78] On Metacritic, the film has a 67 out of 100, indicating "generally favorable reviews", based on reviews from 44 critics.[79] Many critics praised Jennifer Lawrence for her portrayal as Katniss Everdeen, as well as most of the main cast. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Lawrence embodies Katniss, "just as one might imagine her from the novel".[80] Empire magazine said "Lawrence is perfect as Katniss, there's very little softness about her, more a melancholy determination that good must be done even if that requires bad things."[80] Several critics have reviewed the film favorably compared with other young-adult fiction adaptations such as Harry Potter and Twilight. Justin Craig of Fox News rated the film as "[e]xcellent" and stated: "Move over Harry Potter. A darker, more mature franchise has come to claim your throne."[81] Rafer Guzman of Newsday referred to The Hunger Games as being "darker than 'Harry Potter,' more sophisticated than 'Twilight'."[82] David Sexton of The Evening Standard stated that The Hunger Games "is well cast and pretty well acted, certainly when compared with Harry Potter's juvenile leads."[83]Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, praising the movie as "effective entertainment" and Lawrence's performance. Despite being a largely positive review, he criticized the film for being too long and noted that the film misses opportunities for social criticism.[84] Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy gave the film four stars out of five, calling it "enthralling from beginning to end, science fiction that has depth and intelligence to match its pulse-racing entertainment value". Reynolds also spoke highly of Lawrence's performance and director Gary Ross, whose "rough and ready handheld camerawork" meant that viewers were "with Katniss for every blood-flecked moment of her ordeal in the combat arena".[85] However, film critic David Thomson of the magazine The New Republic called it a "terrible movie", criticizing it for a lack of character development and unclear presentation of the violence, describing the latter as "un-American".[86]Eric Goldman of IGN awarded the film four out of five stars, stating that director Gary Ross "gets the tone of The Hunger Games right. This is a grounded, thoughtful and sometimes quite emotional film, with its dark scenario given due weight. Ross doesn't give the film a glossy, romanticized 'Hollywood' feel, but rather plays everything very realistically and stark, as Katniss must endure these outrageous and horrible scenarios."[87] The film received some criticism for its shaky camera style, but it was said to "add to the film in certain ways".[87] The violence drew commentary as well, Time critic Mary Pols considered that the film was too violent for young children, even though the violence had been toned down compared with the novel,[88] while critic Thoden Janes of the Charlotte Observer found that "[...] the violence is so bland it dilutes the message".[89] Also writing in Time, psychologist Christopher J. Ferguson argued that parents' fears of the effect of the film's violent content on their children were unnecessary, and that children are capable of viewing violent content without being psychologically harmed.[90] Both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson were praised for their portrayals as Katniss and Peeta. Many critics also praised Isabelle Fuhrman's chilling portrayal of "Clove", identifying her as a break-out star.[91]On February 22, 2012, The Hunger Games broke the record for first-day advance ticket sales on Fandango, topping the previous record of Eclipse. The sales were reported to be 83percent of the site's totals for the day.[92] According to first tracking, unaided awareness for The Hunger Games was 11%, definite interest was 54%, first choice was 23% and total awareness was 74%.[93] In the week leading up to its release, the film sold-out over 4,300 showings via Fandango and MovieTickets.com[94] On Fandango alone it ranks as the third-highest advance ticket seller ever behind New Moon and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  Part 2.[95] Finally, according to Fandango it broke the site's single-day sales record (March 23), the mobile sales record for a weekend (March 2325, 2012) and the site's highest share of a film's opening weekend (Fandango sold 22% of the film's opening weekend tickets).[96]The Hunger Games earned $408,010,692 in North America, and $278,522,598 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $686,533,290.[4] It made the largest worldwide opening weekend for a film not released during the summer or the holiday period, earning $211.8million, which was just ahead of Alice in Wonderland's previous record ($210.1million).[97]In North America, The Hunger Games is the thirteenth highest-grossing film, the highest-grossing film released outside the summer or holiday period,[98] and the highest-grossing film distributed by Lionsgate.[99] The film set a midnight-gross record for a non-sequel ($19.7million), which is also the seventh-highest midnight gross overall.[100] On its opening day, it made $67.3million (including midnight showings), setting opening-day and single-day records for a non-sequel, both of which were later surpassed by Marvel's The Avengers.[9] The film also achieved the sixth highest opening-day and seventh highest single-day grosses of all time.[101][102][103] On its opening weekend, the movie grossed $152.5million, breaking Alice in Wonderland's opening-weekend records for a film released in March, for any spring release, and for a non-sequel  the latter surpassed by The Avengers.[99][104][105][106] Its opening weekend gross is also the largest for any film released outside the summer season and the fourth-largest of all time overall.[107] It remained in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since Avatar to achieve this.[11][108][109] On June 10, 2012 (its 80th day in theaters), it became the 14th movie to pass the $400-million-mark.[110] On April 20, 2012, Lionsgate and IMAX Corporation announced that due to "overwhelming demand", The Hunger Games would return to North American IMAX cinemas on April 27 for a further one-week engagement.[111]Outside North America, the film was released in most countries during March and April 2012,[112] with the exception of China, where it was released in June 2012.[113] On its first weekend (March 2325, 2012), the film topped the box office outside North America with $59.25million from 67 markets, finishing at first place in most of them.[114] The largest opening weekends were recorded in China ($9.6 million),[113] Australia ($9.48million), and the UK, Ireland and Malta ($7.78 million).[112][115] In total earnings, its highest-grossing markets after North America are the UK, Ireland and Malta ($36.5 million), Australia ($31.1 million), and Germany ($20.0 million).[112]The film was released in North America and the Netherlands on DVD and Blu-ray August 18, 2012 and in the rest of Europe on September 3, 2012. Extras include 'The World is Watching: The Making of The Hunger Games', numerous featurettes, the propaganda video in its entire form, a talk with the director Gary Ross and also Elvis Mitchell and a marketing archive.In its first weekend on sale, Lionsgate reported that 3.8 million DVD/Blu-ray copies of the movie were sold, with more than one-third in the Blu-ray format.[116] Three weeks after the release of the movie to home media formats in the US, over 5 million DVD units and 3.7 million Blu-ray units have been sold.[117][118]Charles McGrath, writing for The New York Times, said that the film will remind viewers of the television series Survivor, a little of The Bachelorette, and of the short story "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson published in 1948 by The New Yorker.[119] David Sexton of The Evening Standard compared The Hunger Games unfavourably to Kinji Fukasaku's Japanese film Battle Royale, as did several other critics;[83][120][121][122][123] the novel had earlier faced criticism for its similarities to the novel Battle Royale by Koushun Takami.[124] Jonathan Looms of The Oxford Student argues that it is "unfair that the film is only drawing comparisons with Battle Royale" but that it "is a veritable pastiche of other movies" as well, comparing it to The Truman Show, Death Race, the Bourne films, and Zoolander, and that it is common for artists to borrow from and "improve on many sources. Quentin Tarantino has built his career on this principle."[125] It reminded an author at Salon of the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game.[126]Wheeler Winston Dixon, a film professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, listed several precedents: Battle Royale, Jackson's "The Lottery", William Golding's Lord of the Flies, Metropolis, Blade Runner, Death Race 2000, and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.[127] Manohla Dargis in The New York Times compares it to Battle Royale, Ender's Game, and Twilight, but contrasts The Hunger Games in terms of how its "exciting" female protagonist Katniss "rescues herself with resourcefulness, guts and true aim."[128] Steve Rose of The Guardian refers to the film as "think Battle Royale meets The Running Man meets Survivor."[129] Writing in The Atlantic, Govindini Murty made a list of touchstones the film alludes to, from the ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian civilizations to modern references such as the Great Depression, the Vietnam and Iraq Wars, and reality television.[130] For her part, author Collins cites the myth of Theseus, reality television and coverage of the Iraq War as her inspiration.[131][132][133]During the film's opening weekend, controversial statements about various members of the cast arose, sparking open dialog about issues of racism, sexism and unrealistic body image. In a Jezebel article published March 26, 2012, Dodai Stewart reported that several users on Twitter posted racist tweets, criticizing the portrayals of Rue, Thresh and Cinna by African American actors.[134][135] In a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Collins stated that while she did not have any ethnic background in mind for lead characters Katniss and Gale because the book is written in "a time period where hundreds of years have passed" and there would be "a lot of ethnic mixing", she explains "there are some characters in the book who are more specifically described", and states that both Rue and Thresh are African American.[136] Lyneka Little of The Wall Street Journal states that although it is easy to find bigoted or offensive postings online, "the racist 'Hunger Games' tweets, because they are so shockingly ignorant even by the standards of the fringes of the internet, have kicked up a storm."[137] Fahima Haque of The Washington Post, Bim Adewunmi of The Guardian, and Christopher Rosen of The Huffington Post all reiterate the fact that Rue and Thresh are described in The Hunger Games as having dark brown skin, as well as Collins' assertion that they were intended to be depicted as African Americans.[134][138][139] Adewunmi remarked that "it comes to this: if the casting of Rue, Thresh and Cinna has left you bewildered and upset, consider two things. One: you may be a racist  congrats! Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!"[139] Erik Kain of Forbes saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech. He states that while society may never be free of racism, "racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record. Aggregations of these comments, like the Jezebel piece, expose people for what they are. Sure, many hide under the cloak of anonymity, but many others cannot or choose not to. And as the internet becomes more civilized and its denizens more accountable, this sort of thing carries more and more weight."[135] Amandla Stenberg responded to the controversy with the following statement: "As a fan of the books, I feel fortunate to be part of The Hunger Games family... It was an amazing experience; I am proud of the film and my performance. I want to thank all of my fans and the entire Hunger Games community for their support and loyalty."[140] Dayo Okeniyi was quoted saying "I think this is a lesson for people to think before they tweet" and "It's sad... We could now see where society is today. But I try not to think about stuff like that."[141]A number of critics expressed disappointment in Jennifer Lawrence's casting as Katniss because her weight was not representative of a character who has suffered a life of starvation. Manohla Dargis, in her review of the film for The New York Times stated "[a] few years ago Ms. Lawrence might have looked hungry enough to play Katniss, but now, at 21, her seductive, womanly figure makes a bad fit for a dystopian fantasy about a people starved into submission."[142] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said that in certain scenes, Lawrence displays "lingering baby fat."[143] These remarks have been rebuked by a number of journalists for pushing unrealistic body image expectations for women.[144] L.V. Anderson of Slate states that "[j]ust as living in a world with abundant calories does not automatically make everyone fat, living in a dystopian world like Panem with sporadic food access would not automatically make everyone skinny. Some bodies, I daresay, would be even bigger than Lawrence's."[145] Since none of Lawrence's male co-stars have come under the same scrutiny, Anderson concludes complaints about Lawrence's weight are inherently sexist.[145] MTV asked for responses from audiences on the controversy and reported that most found criticism of Lawrence's weight "misguided."[146] One response pointed to Collins' physical description of Katniss in The Hunger Games novel which reads "I stand straight, and while I'm thin, I'm strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me."[147] Los Angeles Times writer Alexandra Le Tellier commented that "[t]he sexist commentary along with the racist barbs made by so-called fans are as stomach-churning as the film's cultural commentary, which, in part, shines a light on the court of public opinion and its sometimes destructive power to determine someone else's fate."[148]Screening of The Hunger Games has been delayed indefinitely in Vietnam.[149] The film was to be released on March 30, 2012, but, according to a member of the Vietnamese National Film Board, the Board considers the film to be too violent and unanimously voted for the indefinite delay. It is, in fact, banned.[150]There have also been comparisons between The Hunger Games premise of children killing each other, and the child soldiers of the Lord's Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony in the midst of the Kony 2012 campaign.[151][152][153]Interpretations of the film's themes and messages have been widely discussed among critics and other commentators. In his review for The Washington Times, Peter Suderman expressed that "[m]aybe it's a liberal story about inequality and the class divide. Maybe it's a libertarian epic about the evils of authoritarian government. Maybe it's a feminist revision on the sci-fi action blockbuster. Maybe it's a bloody satire of reality television", but concludes the film only proposes these theories and brings none of them to a reasonable conclusion.[167]Reviewers and critics have differing views on whether the film represents feminist issues. Historically, among the "top 200 worldwide box-office hits ever ($350million and up), not one has been built around a female action star."[168] Manohla Dargis sees Katniss Everdeen as a female hero following in the lineage of "archetypal figures in the literature of the American West" such as Natty Bumppo, as well as characters portrayed by American actors such as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood.[169] Katniss is also seen as defying normative gender roles: she exhibits both "masculine" and "feminine" traits equally.[169] Dargis also notes that Katniss is a female character with significant agency: "Katniss is a fantasy figure, but partly what makes her powerful  and, I suspect, what makes her so important to a lot of girls and women  is that she's one of the truest feeling, most complex female characters to hit American movies in a while. She isn't passive, she isn't weak, and she isn't some random girl. She's active, she's strong and she's the girl who motivates the story."[169] Similarly, Shelley Bridgeman of The New Zealand Herald wrote that because the characteristics of "athleticism, strength, courageousness and prowess at hunting" are not given to a male protagonist, but to Katniss, her character is an abrupt departure from the stereotypical depiction of women as being innately passive or helpless.[170] Mahvesh Murad of the The Express Tribune said that the film's triumph is "a young female protagonist with agency", comparing her with Joss Whedon's Buffy Summers.[171]Kate Heartfield of the Ottawa Citizen does not share the view that the film, or the books on which it is based, is feminist. Despite being a blockbuster film with a female lead possessing masculine characteristics, Heartfield argues, The Hunger Games fails to challenge patriarchal or orthodox paradigms.[172] As evidence for her claim, Heartsfield points to the fact that Katniss is torn between her feelings for two male love interests, a trait she shares with Bella Swan of the The Twilight Saga, with whom she is often compared and contrasted.[172] Heartfield asserts that while Katniss may be an exceptional character, "she isn't threatening to our social order. There's no controversy over women taking up archery or martial arts. There is controversy these days in the United States over access to birth control. The relationship between female power in The Hunger Games and the real feminist battles of 2012 is comfortably remote."[172]The film has drawn varying interpretations for its political overtones, including arguments in favor of left-wing, right-wing, and libertarian viewpoints. Bob Burnett of The Huffington Post observed the film displays a general distrust of government, regardless of the audience's political party affiliation.[173] Steven Zeitchik and Emily Rome, in the Dallas Morning News, also stated that some viewers formed an opinion about The Hunger Games as a parable of the Occupy Wall Street activity.[174] The Huffington Post reported that Penn Badgley, a supporter of Occupy Wall Street, saw the film as a social commentary on the movement.[175] Burnett also states that "Collins doesn't use the terms 1percent and 99percent, but it's clear that those in the Capitol are members of the 1percent and everyone in the Panem districts is part of the 99percent".[173]Steven Zeitchik and Emily Rome, in the Los Angeles Times and the Dallas Morning News reported that, among other disparate interpretations, some viewers saw The Hunger Games as a Christian allegory.[176][177] Jeffrey Weiss of the Star Tribune has remarked on what he saw as the intentional absence of religion in The Hunger Games universe, and has commented that whilst the stories contain no actual religion, people are "find[ing] aspects that represent their own religious values" within it.[178] Donald Brake from The Washington Times, as well as Andy Langford, senior pastor at Central United Methodist Church in Concord, North Carolina and his daughter, Ann G. L. Duncan, a pastor at Hoyle Memorial United Methodist Church in Shelby, North Carolina, wrote that the film has Christian themes, such as that of self-sacrifice, which is found in Katniss' substitution for her younger sister, analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus as a substitute for the atonement of sins.[179][180] Brake, as well as another reviewer, Amy Simpson, both find that the film also revolves around the theme of hope, which is exemplified in the "incorruptible goodness of Katniss' sister, Primrose."[181] She also describes that Peeta Mellark is "a Christ figure" in the film.[182] Similar to the events in the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus, in the Games, Peeta is stabbed and left for dead after saving Katniss' lifetaking the wound that was initially meant for herand is then buried in the ground and placed in a cave for three days before emerging with a new lease on life.[183] Moreover, the Christian image of the Bread of Life is used throughout The Hunger Games; in the film, Peeta shows up "bearing a warm loaf of bread," and Katniss slowly comes "back to life."[184] A news video starring Jonathan Morris aired on Fox News discussed the religious themes in the film further.[185] In addition, many pastors have written Bible studies discussing the Christian allegories in the film.[186][187]On August 8, 2011, while still shooting the film, Lionsgate announced that a film adaptation of the second novel in The Hunger Games trilogy, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, is scheduled to be released on November 22, 2013.[188] In November 2011, Lionsgate entered negotiations with screenwriter Simon Beaufoy to adapt the novel for screen, since the post-production schedule for The Hunger Games was too crowded for Ross and Collins to adapt the next film as originally planned.[189] The Hunger Games: Catching Fire will begin production in the summer of 2012.[190] Gary Ross will not return for Catching Fire, and instead Francis Lawrence will direct.[191][192][193][194] On May 6, 2012, it was reported that Michael Arndt was in talks to re-write the script for Catching Fire.[195] Arndt officially signed on as the new script writer on May 24, 2012.[196]In July 2012, release dates were confirmed for two films based on the last book Mockingjay. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 will be released November 21, 2014 and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2 will be released November 20, 2015.[197] Lawrence, Hutcherson, Hemsworth, and Harrelson have all signed on to the whole franchise.[3][198] The Hunger Games: Catching Fire began filming September 10, 2012.[199]March 12, 2012(2012-03-12) (Premiere)March 22, 2012(2012-03-22) (Philippines)March 23, 2012(2012-03-23) (United States)1 Plot2 Cast3 Production

MouseHunt is a Facebook game in which players, referred to as hunters, catch mice with a variety of traps to earn experience points and virtual gold through passive gameplay. From time to time, the developers add new locations and mice as well as sponsor periodic giveaways and tournaments. MouseHunt was developed by HitGrab, Inc. under the direction of Bryan Freeman and Joel Aug, and was released to a select group of participants for beta testing in early 2007. On 7 March 2008, MouseHunt was officially released to the general public. Just nine months later, MouseHunt earned its creators a $250,000 development grant from Facebook.[1] Though MouseHunt was originally catered for the US population, specifically those who live in GMT-8 to GMT-4, Mousehunt is hugely popular in many Asian and Pacific Countries, especially Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and Philippines.[citation needed]On October 16, 2010 MouseHunt was also released on the hi5 social network, but was shut down in February 2012.[2]The game of MouseHunt is set in the fantastic kingdom of Gnawnia. The player is a hunter, commissioned by the King of Gnawnia to catch mice that infest the kingdom by using virtual traps, bases and cheese.MouseHunt is a passive game. The player, called a hunter, arms a trap (using cheese as bait) and can then sound the "Hunter's Horn" once every 15 minutes. If a player is playing the game for the first time, there is a special mission and the player can sound the "Hunter's Horn" once every 30 seconds. Every time the hunter's horn is sounded, they are taken on a hunt and have a possibility of catching a mouse. For each mouse the player catches, they get a unique reward, which is a certain amount of points and gold, dependent on the breed of mouse captured. Automatic "Trap Checks" conducted at the top of each hour allow for a total of five opportunities to catch mice every hour.Friend networks are used in the game, as players who are in-network friends (e.g., Facebook friends) can sound the horn for each other if hunting in the same area.Friends can also send in-game gifts to each other. Some items from a hunter's inventory (gold, some cheeses and crafting items, gift baskets, and trap skins) can be given to friends. Additionally, hunters may send daily free gifts, which vary somewhat from day to day, and during certain events can buy virtual in-game gifts for friends, using either virtual gold or through donations.Friends can form teams; a new team can have at most five members including the captain, but three additional member slots can be unlocked. To unlock each extra slot, teams must complete a task. Slot 1: Complete 10 tournaments, slot 2: Obtain 10 Participant badges and slot 3: Obtain 10 Competitor badges.[3] Tournaments were initially released on 13 May 2009, but were discontinued on 8 June 2010. After more than a year, this feature was finally re-released on 28 December 2011. Tournaments involve hunting for certain specific mice, each of which has a certain point value within the tournament, for a certain pre-determined time period. In-game prizes are awarded to hunters based on the finishing score of their team.When the player first starts to play the game, they have the rank of Novice. As the player progresses through the game, they will increase in rank, in the order of Recruit, Apprentice, Initiate, Journeyman, Master, Grandmaster, Legendary, Hero, Knight, Lord/Lady, Baron/Baroness, Count/Countess, Duke/Duchess, Grand Duke/Grand Duchess, Archduke/Archduchess. The ranks Recruit and Initiate were added in version 3.0 as a way to split Novice and Apprentice into 2 more ranks. Increases in rank are dependent on how active the player is, in addition to other factors such as the quality (number of points the mice caught is worth as well as the general difficulty of the mouse) and quantity of mice caught.For each increase in rank, the player will receive a new color/appearance for the shield next to their name in their hunter's profile. They also gain features such as more crafting slots for crafting items and greater number of cheese imbued per potion.When players start out, they can only access the Meadow as their hunting location, but more locations are unlocked as they progress in rank. Certain locations, however, also require map pieces, the crafting of certain items and other forms of loot such as keys to be accessed. There are a total of 37 locations in the game, grouped into nine regions. In addition, a place-holder location for banned players (they cannot sound the horn or access the game), who have violated the game's Terms of Service, called the King's Stockade was added in April 2009.When traveling to other locations, hunters will be charged a certain amount of gold contingent on the distance of the destination from the hunters' origin. In previous versions of the game, travel to the Town of Gnawnia was free. This has been replaced by a separate travel tab that transports players to the Meadow for free.Besides this conventional mode of travel, there are certain locations where timers and counters are implemented, whereby hunters will be automatically transported to another location once the timer runs out or they have maxed their counter.A trap setup consists of a weapon, a base, a piece of cheese and, if desired by the Hunter, a Charm. Traps are either bought or crafted. For traps that can be bought, they can be found at certain stores, called Trapsmiths, and they can be refunded for 18% of the purchase price.Traps that are crafted as well as previous Limited Edition traps (see section on Ronza's Traveling Shoppe) are non-refundable.Traps also have power types depending on the weapon, and it would influence the effectiveness of the trap against certain types of mice. The current power types for the traps in the game are Physical, Tactical, Shadow, Arcane, Hydro, Forgotten, Draconic and Parental.Trap components have a certain point or rank requirement, preventing players with lesser points from being able to buy or craft the trap component even if they have sufficient gold to buy it or crafting items to craft it. For example, if the points requirement of a certain trap is 16 million points, and the player has 2 million points, they would be unable to buy or craft the item, despite having sufficient gold and crafting items. This is to prevent players from "buying their way" through the game.As of January 12, 2011, an additional component called Charms has been added. Charms are consumable items that modify certain trap attributes. They are used up (1 charm per mouse encountered, or 1 per specific mouse encountered) as the players hunts. There are varying types of Charms such as those that modify power, attraction and luck. In addition to those, some charms that allow mice to be weakened, allow hunters to bypass timers in some areas, and increase drop rate of specific loot such as potions. Charms are purchased from a charm shoppe or are crafted. All crafted charms can be bought on the Marketplace. More types of Charms are intended to be added as the game is updated.A base adds a little bit of power to your trap. It also might increase additional things like power, luck, attraction bonus, but it will not change the weapon's power type.There is a very large cheese variety on offer, which can be bought or crafted. At present there are 5 (not including SUPER|brie+) standard cheeses that can be bought with gold at the various Cheese Shoppes in the game, namely Cheddar, Marble, Swiss, Brie, and Gouda. There are 28 special cheeses that can be crafted, created with potions, or picked up as loot. There are a total of 11 types of cheese (Rockforth, Gingerbread Cheese, Onyx Gorgonzola, Candy Corn Cheese, Seasoned Gouda, Nutmeg, Cupcake Colby, Festive Feta, Marshmallow Monterey, Undead Emmental, and Festive Feta) which were used in special events up to the present.Certain cheese can be made by imbuing potions into a certain type of cheese. Some cheeses can also be made by crafting through the use of crafting ingredients found in General Stores and/or from loot dropped by mice.Crafting is an important element into the game, especially when people ascend ranks. A wide variety of things can be crafted, such as traps, bases and cheese. Crafting is only available to players who are Apprentice (the third rank) and above. As a person goes up in rank, they will get more "crafting slots", meaning that they can combine more items at a time. Players initially have 2 slots, increasing to a (current) maximum of 12 slots for Duke/Duchess. Within the crafting section, there is also the Hunter's Hammer, which is essentially a tool to "smash" certain items, such as cheese or trap components, which usually are used to craft another items, generally other kinds of cheese or upgraded traps. In the present version of MouseHunt, a "Recipe Book" was added that allows player to craft multiple quantities of a weapon, base, cheese or any crafting item at once.Some mice may drop loot, which includes map pieces, potions and crafting items, cheese, collectibles etc. The percentage of loot drops varies depending on the breed of mice as well as other factors such as trap luck. These can usually be used in the game to accelerate in forms of progress, and is sometimes even necessary for it.Potions are used to imbue a certain type of cheese into another type of cheese. For example, imbuing brie cheese with a Radioactive Blue Cheese curd potion would convert the brie cheese into Radioactive Blue cheese. The number of cheese that can be imbued per potion increases based on the rank of the player. The Developers have mentioned that in the future, potions may be used to upgrade trap components.Mice are divided into different "Groups" - there are 20 as of the MouseHunt v3.0 update: Indigenous Mice, Gauntlet Gladiators, Forest Guild, The Shadow Clan, Digby Dirt Dwellers, Followers of Furoma, The Forgotten Mice, Aquatic Order, The Elub Tribe, The Nerg Tribe, The Derr Tribe, The Dreaded Horde, Draconic Brood, Balack's Banished, Seasonal Soldiers, Wizard's Pieces, Zurreal's Breed, The Marching Flame, Muridae Market Mice, Icewing's Invasion, Living Garden Mice, Lost City Mice, Sand Dunes Mice and Event Mice. Members of the group share common weaknesses with the exception of the "Gauntlet Gladiators" group. There are eight power types in the game: Physical, Shadow, Tactical, Forgotten, Arcane, Hydro, Draconic and Parental. Using the right kind of cheese gives the hunter a higher chance of attracting the mice they want and using the right power type of trap would increase the chances of catching the mice.From its birth in March 2008 until now, MouseHunt has 330 breeds of mice excluding the Event Mice. Some of them, when caught will drop loot, which depending on the type of loot may be essential to players' progress through the game. Along with this, there are 67 special Event Mice, some of which are released for a short period during occasional events. These mice might drop cheese, crafting items, collectibles and cash prizes (a Mousehunter won $1000 CAD for being the first in catching a mouse known as the Master Burglar mouse. This mouse is now no longer a rare mouse). You are also able to catch the Leprechaun mouse, worth $25500 (which currently has over 1000 catches), and many other in-game prizes. The mice in this game are loosely based on real life. For example, the White, Grey and Brown mouse can be found in the Meadow and other places suitable for starters, its normal habitat. And as a further example, some of the mice which belong to the group "Followers of Furoma" practice martial arts. Different groups have distinct differences as well as trap requirements to trap them.The Marketplace is meant to be an auction house for hunters to buy items that other hunters are selling. The Marketplace began with only being able to buy or sell the Key to the Town of Digby, Burroughs Laboratory Map Piece, and SUPER|brie+. In V2.0 the Marketplace was moved to its own discussion board. The only thing to purchase was SUPER|brie+. Hunters would negotiate and then trade, but the system was unliked. June 21, 2010, v3.0, it reopened under the shops tab. Hunters could anonymously sell SUPER|brie+, Moon, and Maki cheeses. In an update hunters were allowed to sell Zugzwang's Left Sock. Another update and hunters were allowed to sell Ninja Ambush skin, Grungy Deathbot skin, Fluffy Deathbot Skin, and Wishing Well Basket.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the seventh and final of the Harry Potter novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The book was released on 21July2007 by Bloomsbury Publishing in the United Kingdom, in the United States by Scholastic, and in Canada by Raincoast Books, ending the series that began in 1997 with the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The novel chronicles the events directly following Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005), and the final confrontation between the wizards Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in January 2007. Before its release, Bloomsbury reportedly spent GB10million to keep the book's contents safe before its release date. American publisher Arthur Levine refused any copies of the novel to be released in advance for press review, although two reviews were submitted early. Shortly before release, photos of all 759 pages of the U.S. edition were leaked and transcribed, leading Scholastic to look for the source that had leaked it.Released globally in 93 countries, Deathly Hallows broke sales records as the fastest-selling book ever, a record it still holds today.[2] It sold 15million copies in the first 24 hours following its release, including more than 11million in the U.S. and UK alone. The previous record, 9million in its first day, had been held by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The novel has also been translated into over 120languages, including Ukrainian, Swedish, and Hindi.Major themes in the novel are death and living in a corrupted society, and critics have compared them to Christian allegories. Generally well-received, the book won the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award, and the American Library Association named it a "Best Book for Young Adults". A two-part film adaptation began showing in November 2010 when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  Part 1 was released; Part 2 was released on 15 July 2011.Throughout the six previous novels in the series, the titular character Harry Potter has struggled with the difficulties of adolescence along with being a famous wizard. When Harry was a baby, Lord Voldemort, a powerful evil wizard, murdered Harry's parents but vanished after attempting to kill Harry. Harry immediately became famous, and was placed in the care of his Muggle (non-magical) relatives Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon.In Philosopher's Stone, Harry re-enters the wizarding world at age 11 and enrolls in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He makes friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also meets the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, and Professor Severus Snape, who dislikes him. Harry fights Voldemort several times while at school, as the wizard tries to regain a physical form. In Goblet of Fire, Harry is entered in a dangerous magical competition called the Triwizard Tournament. At the conclusion of the Tournament, Harry witnesses the return of Lord Voldemort to full strength. During Order of the Phoenix, Harry and several of his friends face off against Voldemort's Death Eaters, a group of Dark witches and wizards, and narrowly defeat them. In Half-Blood Prince, Harry learns that Voldemort has created six "horcruxes" to become immortal. A Horcrux is a fragment of a person's soul placed within an object so that when the body dies, a part of the soul remains and the person can be regenerated or resurrected.[3] However, the destruction of the creator's body leaves the wizard or witch in a state of half-life, without corporeal form.[4] Two horcruxes have already been destroyed, one by Harry in the events of Chamber of Secrets and one by Dumbledore shortly before the events of Half-Blood Prince. When returning from a mission to discover a horcrux, Dumbledore is murdered by Snape, a former Death Eater whom Harry suspected of secretly remaining loyal to Voldemort. At the conclusion of the book, Harry decides to leave school, find and destroy the remaining four Horcruxes, and defeat the evil wizard Voldemort, once and for all.Following Dumbledore's death, Voldemort continues to gain support and increase his power. When Harry turns seventeen, the protection he has at his aunt and uncle's house will be broken. Before that can happen, at Mad Eye Moody's suggestion, Harry flees to the Burrow with his friends, many of whom use Polyjuice Potion to impersonate him so as to confuse any Death Eaters that may attack. They are indeed attacked shortly after leaving Privet Drive; Mad Eye is killed, and George Weasley wounded, but the rest arrive safely at the Burrow. Ron and Hermione decide to accompany Harry, instead of returning to Hogwarts School for their seventh year, to finish the quest Dumbledore started: to hunt and destroy Voldemort's four remaining Horcruxes. They have little knowledge about the remaining Horcruxes except that one is a locket once owned by Hogwarts' co-founder Salazar Slytherin, one is possibly a cup once owned by co-founder Helga Hufflepuff, a third may be connected with co-founder Rowena Ravenclaw, and the fourth may be Nagini, Voldemort's snake familiar. The whereabouts of the founders' objects is unknown, and Nagini is presumed to be with Voldemort. Before leaving, they attend Ron's brother's Bill's wedding to Fleur Delacour, with Harry disguised by Polyjuice Potion, but the Ministry of Magic is taken over by Death Eaters during the wedding and they barely escape with their lives.Harry, Ron, and Hermione flee to 12 Grimmauld Place in London, which is Sirius Black's family's house, where they learn from the house-elf Kreacher the whereabouts of Salazar Slytherin's locket, which Sirius' brother Regulus stole from Voldemort at the cost of his own life. They successfully recover this Horcrux by infiltrating the Ministry of Magic and stealing it from Dolores Umbridge. Under the object's evil influence and the stress of being on the run, Ron leaves the others. As Harry and Hermione search for the Horcruxes, they learn more about Dumbledore's past, including the insanity and death of Dumbledore's younger sister and his connection to the evil wizard Grindewald. Harry and Hermione ultimately travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and the place where his parents died. They meet the eldery magical historian Bathilda Bagshot, who turns out to be Nagini in disguise and attacks them. They escape into the Forest of Dean, where a mysterious silver doe that appears to be a Patronus leads Harry to the Sword of Hogwarts co-founder Godric Gryffindor, one of the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes, lying at the bottom of an icy lake. When Harry attempts to recover the sword from the pool, the Horcrux attempts to kill him. Ron reappears, saving Harry and then using the sword to destroy the locket. Resuming their search, the trio repeatedly encounter a strange symbol that an eccentric wizard named Xenophilius Lovegood tells them represents the mythical Deathly Hallows. The Hallows are three sacred objects: the Elder Wand, an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, with the power to summon the dead to the living world; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. Harry learns that Voldemort is seeking the Elder Wand, recognizes the Resurrection Stone from the second Horcrux, which Dumbledore had destroyed, and realizes that his own Invisibility Cloak is the one mentioned in the story, but he is unaware of the Hallows' significance.The trio are captured and taken to Malfoy Manor, where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione. Harry and Ron are thrown in the cellar, where they find Luna Lovegood, Ollivander, Dean Thomas, and Griphook. They escape to Shell Cottage (Bill and Fleur's house) with Dobby's help, but at the cost of the house-elf's life. Harry now realizes that the Hallows may have the power to defeat Death and knows that Voldemort robbed Dumbledore's tomb to procure the Elder Wand, but he decides to focus on finding the Horcruxes instead of the Hallows. With Griphook's help, they learn that Helga Hufflepuff's cup - a Horcrux - is hidden in Bellatrix's vault at Gringotts, break into her vault, retrieve the cup, and escape on a dragon, with Griphook swiping the sword and escaping on his own. From his connection to Voldemort's thoughts, Harry learns that another Horcrux is hidden in Hogwarts, which is under the control of Severus Snape. Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter the school through Hogsmeade (being saved by Aberforth Dumbledore, who explains more about Albus's backstory) and - with the help of the teachers - Snape is ousted from the school. Ron and Hermione go to the Chamber of Secrets and destroy the cup using a basilisk fang. The trio then finds Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem (another Horcrux) in the Room of Requirement. Vincent Crabbe casts a Fiendfyre curse in an attempt to kill Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but he instead destroys the diadem, the Room of Requirement, and himself. At this point, a total of five Horcruxes have been destroyed.The Death Eaters and Voldemort besiege Hogwarts, while Harry, Ron, Hermione, their allies, and various magical creatures defend the school. Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle, including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and Fred Weasley. Voldemort kills Severus Snape because he believes doing so will make him the Elder Wand's true master, since Snape killed Dumbledore. Harry discovers while viewing Snape's memories that Voldemort inadvertently made Harry into a seventh Horcrux when he attacked him as a baby, which is the true significance of Harry's scar, and that Harry must die in order to destroy Voldemort. These memories also confirm Snape's unwavering loyalty to Dumbledore and that his role as a double-agent against Voldemort never wavered after Voldemort killed Lily Evans, Harry's mother and Snape's one true love. Harry also learns that Dumbledore had less than a year to live when he died, that his death by Snape's hand had been per Dumbledore's request, and that Dumbledore had known that Harry must die. After using the Resurrection Stone to bring back his deceased loved ones for a short while, Harry surrenders himself to death at Voldemort's hand. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse at him, but it only sends Harry into a limbo-like state between life and death.While in this state, Dumbledore's spirit explains to Harry that when Voldemort used Harry's blood to regain his full strength, it protected Harry from Voldemort killing him; however, the Horcrux inside Harry has been destroyed, and Harry can return to his body despite being hit by the Killing Curse. Dumbledore also explains that Harry became the true master of the Deathly Hallows by facing Death, not by seeking to avoid it or conquer it. Harry returns to his body, feigning death, and Voldemort marches victoriously into the castle with his body. However, per Harry's prior instructions, Neville Longbottom kills Nagini, the last Horcrux, with the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry then reveals that he is still alive, and the battle resumes, with Bellatrix Lestrange being killed by Molly Weasley.Harry and Voldemort engage in a final climactic duel. Harry reveals that because he willingly sacrificed himself to death by Voldemort's hand, his act of love would protect the Wizarding community from Voldemort in the same way the sacrifice Harry's mother made protected Harry. Harry also reveals that Snape was not loyal to Voldemort, did not murder Dumbledore, and was never the master of the Elder Wand. Instead, Draco was the master of the Elder Wand after disarming Dumbledore, but, because Harry had disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor, Harry is the true master of the Elder Wand. Harry claims that the wand will refuse to kill the one to whom it owes allegiance, further protecting Harry. During the duel, Harry refuses to use the killing curse and even encourages Voldemort to feel remorse, one known way to restore Voldemort's shattered soul. Voldemort dies when his own killing curse backfires against Harry's disarming curse, killing himself; the Death Eaters are finally defeated. The wizarding world is able to live in peace once more.The novel, the last in the series, closes with a brief epilogue set 19 years later, in which Harry and Ginny Weasley are a married couple with three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. Ron and Hermione Weasley are also married and have two children, Rose and Hugo. The families meet at King's Cross station, where a nervous Albus is departing for his first year at Hogwarts. Harry's godson, Teddy Lupin, is found kissing Bill and Fleur Weasley's daughter Victoire in a train carriage. Harry sees Draco Malfoy and his wife with their son, Scorpius. Neville Longbottom is now the Hogwarts Herbology professor and remains friends with the two families. Harry comforts Albus, who is worried he will be sorted into Slytherin, and tells his son that one of his two namesakes, Severus Snape, was a Slytherin and the bravest man he had ever met. He adds that the Sorting Hat takes one's choice into account, like it did for Harry. The book ends with these final words: "The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well."Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published by Bloomsbury, the publisher of all Harry Potter books in the United Kingdom, on 30 June 1997.[5] It was released in the United States on 1 September 1998 by Scholasticthe American publisher of the booksas Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,[6] after Rowling had received US$105,000 for the American rightsan unprecedented amount for a children's book by a then-unknown author.[7]The second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998, and in the US on 2 June 1999. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was then published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999, and in the US on 8 September 1999.[8] Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8 July 2000 at the same time by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.[9] Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the longest book in the series at 766 pages in the UK version and 870 pages in the US version.[10] It was published worldwide in English on 21 June 2003.[11] Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was published on 16 July 2005, and it sold 9million copies in the first 24 hours of its worldwide release.[12][13]Shortly before releasing the title, J. K. Rowling announced that she had considered three titles for the book.[14][15] The final title, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, named after the mythical Deathly Hallows in the novel, was released to the public on 21December2006, via a special Christmas-themed hangman puzzle on Rowling's website, confirmed shortly afterwards by the book's publishers.[16] When asked during a live chat about the other titles she had been considering, Rowling mentioned Harry Potter and the Elder Wand and Harry Potter and the Peverell Quest.[14]Rowling completed the book while staying at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh in January2007, and left a signed statement on a marble bust of Hermes in her room which read: "J. K. Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in this room (652) on 11January2007".[17] In a statement on her website, she said, "I've never felt such a mixture of extreme emotions in my life, never dreamed I could feel simultaneously heartbroken and euphoric." She compared her mixed feelings to those expressed by Charles Dickens in the preface of the 1850 edition of David Copperfield, "a two-years' imaginative task". "To which," she added, "I can only sigh, try seventeen years, Charles". She ended her message by saying "Deathly Hallows is my favourite, and that is the most wonderful way to finish the series".[18]When asked before publication about the forthcoming book, Rowling stated that she could not change the ending even if she wanted. "These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they're all leading a certain direction. So, I really can't".[19] She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, "almost as though they are two halves of the same novel".[20] She has said that the last chapter of the book was written "in something like 1990", as part of her earliest work on the series.[21] Rowling also revealed she originally wrote the last words to be "something like: 'Only those who he loved could see his lightning scar'". Rowling changed this because she did not want people to think Voldemort would rise again and to say that Harry's mission was over.[22]In a 2006 interview, J. K. Rowling said that the main theme of the series is Harry dealing with death,[23] which was influenced by her mother's death in 1990, from multiple sclerosis.[22][23][24][25] Lev Grossman of Time stated that the main theme of the series was the overwhelming importance of continuing to love in the face of death.[26]Academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including political subtexts. Themes such as normality, oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series.[27] Similarly, the theme of making one's way through adolescence and "going over one's most harrowing ordealsand thus coming to terms with them" has also been considered.[28] Rowling has stated that the books comprise "a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to bigotry" and that also pass on a message to "question authority and... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth".[29]Some political commentators have seen J. K. Rowling's portrayal of the bureaucratised Ministry of Magic and the oppressive measures taken by the Ministry in the later books (like making attendance at Hogwarts School compulsory and the "registration of Mudbloods" with the Ministry) as an allegory of criticising the state.[30]The Harry Potter series has been under criticism for supposedly supporting witchcraft and occult. Before publication of Deathly Hallows, Rowling refused to speak out about her religion, stating, "If I talk too freely, every reader, whether 10 or 60, will be able to guess what's coming in the books".[31] However, many have noted Christian allegories apparent in Deathly Hallows.[31] For example, Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. The location where this occurs is King's Cross.[32] Harry also urges Voldemort to show remorse, to restore his shattered soul. Rowling also stated that "my belief and my struggling with religious belief ... I think is quite apparent in this book", which is shown as Harry struggles with his faith in Dumbledore.[33]Deathly Hallows begins with a pair of epigraphs, one by Quaker leader William Penn and one from Aeschylus' The Libation Bearers. Of this, Rowling said "I really enjoyed choosing those two quotations because one is pagan, of course, and one is from a Christian tradition. I'd known it was going to be those two passages since Chamber was published. I always knew [that] if I could use them at the beginning of book seven then I'd cued up the ending perfectly. If they were relevant, then I went where I needed to go. They just say it all to me, they really do".[34]When Harry visits his parents' grave, the biblical reference "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death" (1 Corinthians 15:26) is inscribed on the grave.[35] The Dumbledores' family tomb also holds a biblical quote: "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also", which is from Matthew 6:21.[35] Rowling states, "They're very British books, so on a very practical note Harry was going to find biblical quotations on tombstones...[but] I think those two particular quotations he finds on the tombstones at Godric's Hollow, they sum up they almost epitomise the whole series".[35]Harry Potter pundit John Granger additionally noted that one of the reasons the Harry Potter books were so popular is their use of literary alchemy (similar to Romeo and Juliet, C. S. Lewis's Perelandra and Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities) and vision symbolism.[36] In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, death and resurrection of Christ.[37] While the entire series utilizes symbols common in alchemy, the Deathly Hallows completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.Christian author Nancy Carpentier Brown also noted many Christian themes, such as Harry marking Mad-Eye Moody's grave with a cross, showing remorse and giving Voldemort a chance to redeem himself, and the Resurrection Stone.[38] She also pointed out that Harry becomes a godfather to Tonks and Lupin's son, Teddy Lupin.[38]The launch was celebrated by an all-night book signing and reading at the Natural History Museum in London, which Rowling attended along with 1,700 guests chosen by ballot.[39] Rowling toured the US in October 2007, where another event was held at Carnegie Hall in New York City with tickets allocated by sweepstake.[40]Scholastic, the American publisher of the Harry Potter series, launched a multi-million dollar "There will soon be 7" marketing campaign with a "Knight Bus" travelling to 40 libraries across the United States, online fan discussions and competitions, collectible bookmarks, tattoos, and the staged release of seven Deathly Hallows questions most debated by fans.[41] In the build-up to the book's release, Scholastic released seven questions that fans would find answered in the final book:[42]J. K. Rowling arranged with her publishers for a poster bearing the face of the missing British child Madeleine McCann to be made available to book sellers when Deathly Hallows was launched on 21July2007, and said that she hoped that the posters would be displayed prominently in shops all over the world.[43]After it was told that the novel would be released on 21July2007, Warner Bros. shortly thereafter said that the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix would be released shortly before the novel would be released, on 13July2007,[44] making many people proclaim that July2007, was the month of Harry Potter.[45]Bloomsbury invested GB10million in an attempt to keep the book's contents secure until the 21July release date.[46] Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway.[47] There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalmentsthat the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the serieswould no longer be a deterrent.[48]In the week before its release, a number of texts purporting to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the U.S. edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date.[49][50][51][52] The photographs later appeared on websites and peer-to-peer networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena in order to identify one source.[53] This represented the most serious security breach in the Harry Potter series' history.[54] Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks.[55] Reviews published in both The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times on 18July2007, corroborated many of the plot elements from this leak, and about one day prior to release, The New York Times confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.[54]Scholastic announced that approximately one-ten-thousandth (0.0001) of the U.S. supply had been shipped early interpreted to mean about 1,200 copies. One reader in Maryland received a copy of the book in the mail from DeepDiscount.com four days before it was launched, which evoked incredulous responses from both Scholastic and DeepDiscount. Scholastic initially reported that they were satisfied it had been a "human error" and would not discuss possible penalties;[56] however, the following day Scholastic announced that it would be launching legal action against DeepDiscount.com and its distributor, Levy Home Entertainment.[57] Scholastic filed for damages in Chicago's Circuit Court of Cook County, claiming that DeepDiscount engaged in a "complete and flagrant violation of the agreements that they knew were part of the carefully constructed release of this eagerly awaited book."[58] Some of the early release books soon appeared on eBay, in one case being sold to Publishers Weekly for US$250from an initial price of US$18.[59]Asda,[60][61] along with several other UK supermarkets, having already taken pre-orders for the book at a heavily discounted price, sparked a price war two days before the book's launch by announcing they would sell it for just GB5 a copy (about US$8). Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a loss leader. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even Waterstone's, the UK's largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the UK Booksellers Association, said, "It is a war we can't even participate in. We think it's a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans." Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: "You are not only lowering the price of the book. At this point, you are lowering the value of reading."[62]In Malaysia, a similar price war caused controversy regarding sales of the book.[63] Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia is MYR 109.90 (about GB16), while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90 (about GB10). The move by the bookstores was seen as an attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24July2007, the price war has ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour are selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good business sense and fair trade.[64]The book's early Saturday morning release in Israel was criticised for violating Shabbat. Trade and Industry Minister Eli Yishai commented "It is forbidden, according to Jewish values and Jewish culture, that a thing like this should take place at 2a.m. on Saturday. Let them do it on another day."[65] Yishai indicated that he would issue indictments and fines based on the Hours of Work and Rest Law.[66]The Baltimore Sun's critic, Mary Carole McCauley, noted that the book was more serious than the previous novels in the series and had more straightforward prose.[67] Furthermore, reviewer Alice Fordham from The Times wrote that "Rowling's genius is not just her total realisation of a fantasy world, but the quieter skill of creating characters that bounce off the page, real and flawed and brave and lovable". Fordham concluded, "We have been a long way together, and neither Rowling nor Harry let us down in the end".[68] The New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani agreed, praising Rowling's ability to make Harry both a hero and a character that can be related to.[69]Time magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, ranking it at #8, and praised Rowling for proving that books can still be a global mass medium.[26] Novelist Elizabeth Hand criticised that "...the spectacularly complex interplay of narrative and character often reads as though an entire trilogy's worth of summing-up has been crammed into one volume."[70] In a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, the reviewer said, "Rowling has shown uncommon skill in playing them with and against each other, and also woven them into a darn good bildungsroman, populated by memorable characters and infused with a saving, irrepressible sense of fun". They also praised the second half of the novel, but criticised the epilogue, calling it "provacatively sketchy".[71] In another review from The Times, reviewer Amanda Craig said that while Rowling was "not an original, high-concept author", she was "right up there with other greats of children's fiction". Craig went on to say that the novel was "beautifully judged, and a triumphant return to form", and that Rowling's imagination changed the perception of an entire generation, which "is more than all but a handful of living authors, in any genre, have achieved in the past half-century".[72]In contrast, Jenny Sawyer of The Christian Science Monitor said that, "There is much to love about the Harry Potter series, from its brilliantly realised magical world to its multilayered narrative", however, "A story is about someone who changes. And, puberty aside, Harry doesn't change much. As envisioned by Rowling, he walks the path of good so unwaveringly that his final victory over Voldemort feels, not just inevitable, but hollow".[73] In The New York Times, Christopher Hitchens compared the series to World War Two-era English boarding school stories, and while he wrote that "Rowling has won imperishable renown" for the series as a whole, he also stated that he disliked Rowling's use of deus ex machina, that the mid-book camping chapters are "abysmally long", and Voldemort "becomes more tiresome than an Ian Fleming villain".[74] Catherine Bennett of The Guardian praised Rowling for putting small details from the previous books and making them large in Deathly Hallows, such as Grindelwald being mentioned on a Chocolate Frog Card in the first book. While she points out "as her critics say, Rowling is no Dickens", she says that Rowling "has willed into a fictional being, in every book, legions of new characters, places, spells, rules and scores of unimagined twists and subplots".[75]Stephen King criticised the reactions of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work.[76] He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that the subject matter of the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.[76]Sales for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows were record setting. The initial U.S. print run for Deathly Hallows was 12million copies, and more than a million were pre-ordered through Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble,[77] 500percent higher than pre-sales had been for Half-Blood Prince.[78] On 12April2007, Barnes & Noble declared that Deathly Hallows had broken its pre-order record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site.[79] On opening day, a record 8.3million copies were sold in the United States (over 96 per second),[80][81] and 2.65million copies in the United Kingdom.[82] It holds the Guinness World record for fastest selling book of fiction in 24 hours for U.S. sales.[83] At WH Smith, sales reportedly reached a rate of 15 books sold per second.[84] By June2008, nearly a year after it was published, worldwide sales were reportedly around 44million.[1]Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows has won several awards.[85] In 2007, the book was named one of The New York Times 100 Notable Books,[86] and one of its Notable Children's Books.[87] The novel was named the best book of 2007, by Newsweek's critic Malcolm Jones.[88] Publishers Weekly also listed Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows among their Best Books of 2007.[89] In 2008, the American Library Association named the novel one of its Best Books for Young Adults,[90] and also listed it as a Notable Children's Book.[91] Furthermore, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows received the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award.[85]Due to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' worldwide fame, it has been translated into many languages. The first translation to be released was the Ukrainian translation, on 25September2007 (as     ).[92] The Swedish title of the book was revealed by Rowling as Harry Potter and the Relics of Death (Harry Potter och Ddsrelikerna), following a pre-release question from the Swedish publisher about the difficulty of translating the two words "Deathly Hallows" without having read the book.[93] This is also the title used for the French translation (Harry Potter et les reliques de la mort), the Spanish translation (Harry Potter y las Reliquias de la Muerte), the Dutch translation (Harry Potter en de Relieken van de Dood) and the Brazilian Portuguese translation (Harry Potter e as Relquias da Morte).[94] The first Polish translation was released with a new title: Harry Potter i Insygnia mierci Harry Potter and the Insignia of Death.[95] The Hindi translation Harry Potter aur Maut ke Tohfe (     ), which means "Harry Potter and the Gifts of Death", was released by Manjul Publication in India on 27June2008.[96]Deathly Hallows was released in hardcover on 21July2007,[97] and in paperback in the United Kingdom on 10July2008,[98] and in the United States on 7July2009.[99] In SoHo, New York, there was a release party for the American paperback edition, with many games and activities.[100] An "Adult Edition" with a different cover illustration was released by Bloomsbury on 21July2007.[101] To be released simultaneously with the original U.S. hardcover on 21July with only 100,000 copies was a Scholastic deluxe edition, highlighting a new cover illustration by Mary GrandPr.[102] In October2010, Bloomsbury released a "Celebratory" paperback edition, which featured a foiled and starred cover.[103] Lastly, on 1November2010, a "Signature" edition of the novel was released in paperback by Bloomsbury.[104]A two-part film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is directed by David Yates, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman, David Barron and J. K. Rowling. Part 1 was released on 19November2010, and Part 2 on 15July2011.[105][106] Filming began in February2009, and ended on 12June2010.[107] However, the cast confirmed they would reshoot the epilogue scene as they only had two days to shoot the original.[108] Reshoots officially ended around December 2010.[note 1][109] Part 1 ended at Chapter 24 of the book, when Voldemort regained the Elder Wand.[110] However, there were a few omissions, such as the appearances of Dean Thomas and Viktor Krum, and Peter Pettigrew's death.[111] James Bernadelli of Reelviews said that the script stuck closest to the text since Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,[112] yet this was met with negativity from some audiences as the film inherited "the book's own problems".[113]Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released simultaneously on 21 July 2007, in both the UK and the United States.[114][115] The UK edition features the voice of Stephen Fry and runs about 24 hours[116] while the U.S. edition features the voice of Jim Dale and runs about 21 hours.[117] Both Fry and Dale recorded 146 different and distinguishable character voices, and was the most recorded by an individual on an audiobook at the time.[118]For his work on Deathly Hallows, Dale won the 2008 Grammy Award for the Best Spoken Word Album for Children.[119] He also was awarded an Earphone Award by AudioFile, who claimed, "Dale has raised the bar on audiobook interpretation so high it's hard to imagine any narrator vaulting over it."[120]On 4 December 2008, Rowling released The Tales of Beedle the Bard both in the UK and US.[121] The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a spin-off of Deathly Hallows and contains fairy tales that are told to children in the "Wizarding World". The book includes five short stories, including "The Tale of the Three Brothers" which is the story of the Deathly Hallows.Amazon.com released an exclusive collector's edition of the book which is a replica of the book that Amazon.com purchased at auction in December 2007.[122] Seven copies were auctioned off in London by Sothebys. Each was illustrated and handwritten by Rowling and is 157 pages. It was bound in brown Moroccan leather and embellished with five hand-chased hallmarked sterling silver ornaments and mounted moonstones.[123] 1 Contents

Sonny John Moore (born January 15, 1988), better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic musician and singer-songwriter. Raised in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band (Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count, 2004, and Heroine, 2006) before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007.[2][3] He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007. After recruiting a new band lineup, Moore joined the Alternative Press Tour to support bands such as All Time Low and The Rocket Summer, and appeared on the cover of Alternative Press' annual "100 Bands You Need to Know" issue.[4]After releasing the Gypsyhook EP in 2009, Moore was scheduled to record his debut studio album, Bells, with producer Noah Shain. However, he ceased production of the album and began performing under the name Skrillex. After releasing the My Name is Skrillex EP for free download on his official MySpace page, he released the Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites EP in late2010 and More Monsters and Sprites EP in mid2011. Both have since become moderate commercial successes. On November 30, 2011, he was nominated for a total of five Grammy Awards at the 54th Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and won three: "Best Dance/Electronica Album," "Best Dance Recording," and "Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical".[5] On December 5, 2011, the BBC announced that he had been nominated for their Sound of 2012 poll.[6] On December 12, 2011, he was also named MTV's Electronic Dance Music Artist of the Year.[7]Moore was born in the Highland Park neighborhood of Northeast Los Angeles,[8][9] but moved to the Forest Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at the age of 2, where he attended elementary school. At the ages of 9 and 10, Moore attended a local boarding school located in the Mojave Desert LV, but eventually moved back to Northern California. By the time he was 12, his family moved back to his birthplace of northeast L.A., where he enrolled in a private academy school specializing in arts. Later he was home schooled at the age of 14 due to bullying. In 2004, he learned he was adopted[10] and dropped out of the program when he was 16.[11][12] While a young teenager in Los Angeles, Moore would attend punk gigs in Mexican American neighborhoods in East and South Los Angeles, and later on electro club raves in the downtown's Silver Lake and Echo Park neighborhoods.[1][13]In 2004, Moore contacted Matt Good of From First to Last about playing guitar for the band on their debut album. After flying out to Georgia, Moore was heard singing by three studio producers, Derrick Thomas, Eric Dale, and McHale Butler, and was then made lead singer, with Good playing guitar. In June 2004, Epitaph Records released the band's first full-length record with their new bandmate, Dear Diary, My Teen Angst Has a Body Count. After performing on several successful tours, two being the Vans Warped Tour and Dead by Dawn tour, they began recording their second album, Heroine with producer Ross Robinson. The album was released in March 2006 on Epitaph. With high record sales once again, the band found themselves part of many successful tours, until Moore started suffering vocal problems, causing the band to resign from several tours. After going through a successful vocal surgical procedure, Moore informed the band he would be permanently resigning to work on a solo career. FFTL's last show performed with Moore was in their hometown of Orlando at The House of Blues while touring with Atreyu.Moore announced he had left From First to Last to pursue a solo career. He then launched a Myspace page displaying three demos ("Signal", "Equinox", and "Glow Worm"). This led to Moore's first performance since his leaving From First to Last. On April 7, 2007, alongside harpist Carol Robbins, Moore played several original songs at a local art building.After months of releasing demos via Myspace, Moore played on the Team Sleep Tour with a full band. The tour also featured supporting acts Monster in the Machine and Strata. Moore made several demo CDs available on this tour, limited to about 30 per show. These CDs were tour exclusive, and were packaged in "baby blue envelopes", each with a unique drawing by Moore or bandmate.In February 2008, Alternative Press Magazine announced the second annual AP Tour, with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, The Matches, and Forever the Sickest Kids, as well as Sonny Moore. The tour started in Houston, Texas on March 14 and went through North America, ending in Cleveland, Ohio on May 2, with the majority of the shows being sold out. All bands playing the tour would be featured on the cover of Alternative Press Magazine's annual 100 Bands You Need to Know special, and would be interviewed on the Alternative Press Podcast. During this tour Moore's line-up consisted of Sean Friday on drums, Christopher Null on guitar, and Aaron Rothe on keyboards.On April 7, 2009, he released Gypsyhook EP, a digital EP, which featured three songs and four remixes. Also included was a Japanese version of "Mora" entitled "" ("Kaisui"). Physical copies of the EP were available at his shows. After going on tour with Innerpartysystem and Paper Route and opening for Chiodos on their European tour, Moore performed at Bamboozle on May 2. He performed on Bamboozle Left's Saints and Sinners stage on April 4. He toured with Hollywood Undead in April 2009 performing under the band name Sonny and the Blood Monkeys, with Chris Null (electric guitar), Sean Friday (drums, percussion & beats) and Aaron Rothe (keyboards, synthesizers, programming & turntables)Moore has stated that the album Bells will not be released.[citation needed]In 2008, Moore began producing and performing under the alias Skrillex at clubs in the Los Angeles area.[citation needed] Previously, he had been known on the Internet as Twipz.[citation needed] On June 7, 2010, Moore released his official Skrillex debut EP, My Name is Skrillex as a free download.[14]Moore provided programming and vocals for UK metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon on their third studio album, There Is a Hell, Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven, Let's Keep It a Secret.[15] Later in the year, Sonny began a nationwide tour with Deadmau5 after being signed to mau5trap recordings and released his second EP, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.Moore kicked off the "Project Blue Book Tour" in 2011 with support from Porter Robinson, Tommy Lee and DJ Aero as well as appearances from Sofia Toufa for a new song titled "Bring out the Devil." Skrillex unveiled several new songs on this tour including "First Of The Year" (formerly known as "Equinox"), "Reptile", and "Cinema" (remix of a Benny Benassi track). "Reptile" was featured in the TV commercial for Mortal Kombat 9, and "First of the Year (Equinox)" is featured on his follow up EP and remix companion to Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites, titled More Monsters and Sprites.In April 2011, Spin magazine premiered "Get Up", an exclusive new track from Korn that was produced by Skrillex. Korn made "Get Up" available for free download via their Facebook page.[16] On April 15, 2011 KoRn joined Skrillex on stage for his set at Coachella 2011.On April 18, 2011, Sony Computer Entertainment (SCEA) development studio Naughty Dog released a trailer[17] for the multiplayer component of their PlayStation 3 game Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, featuring "Kill EVERYBODY" from Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.In June 2011, "More Monsters and Sprites" was released on Beatport, an EP consisting of three original tracks, including "First of the Year (Equinox)" and two versions of his original track "Ruffneck". A leaked track entitled "Ruffneck Bass" had been leaked on the internet months prior which used the same sample as in the new "Ruffneck" tracks on the EP. Skrillex released a music video for "Rock n' Roll (Will Take You to the Mountain)" on his official YouTube page on June 20, 2011.[18]On August 17, 2011 Skrillex announced his label, OWSLA. "The label's first releases will come from Bristol-based dubstep producer Koan Sound, electro-house newcomer Porter Robinson from North Carolina, singer/songwriter Alvin Risk, and San Francisco-based M Machine (formally Metropolis)."[19]Skrillex released a music video for "First of the Year (Equinox)" via Spin.com on August 19, 2011.In late August 2011 it was released that he would be appearing Knife Party's first release, collaborating on a Moombahton style track entitled "Zoology". A preview was released on YouTube. In late September 2011 he created the track "Syndicate" as promotion for the video game of the same name.Kaskade's 2011 album Fire & Ice features a collaboration between Kaskade and Skrillex entitled "Lick It".The video for Skrillex's song "First of the Year (Equinox)" appears on the first episode of the Beavis and Butt-head revival.On November 8, Skrillex stated that he intended to release an album entitled Voltage. Skrillex gave fans more info about Voltage in RockSound Magazine after a photoshoot for the cover and doing an extensive interview on his tour.[20] For unknown reasons, however, the album was never released.On December 21, 2011, Skrillex unveiled the Bangarang EP for a Beatport release on December 23.On March 13, 2012, Beatport released OWSLA's second Free Treats sampler, Free Treats Vol. 2. The 19-track compilation features "Ruffneck (FULL Flex) [Munchi Anonymous Revolution Remix]", a remixed track by Skrillex. This new take on the track deviates from the original (released on the More Monsters and Sprites EP), with the remix being more characteristic of Electro House, though with a much slower tempo of 108 BPM, versus the original version's classic Dubstep tempo of 140 BPM, also straying from the typical Electro House tempo of 128 BPM.[21]On August 12, 2012, his new side-project formed with Boys Noize called Dog Blood released an EP called Next Order/Middle Finger.On November 6, 2012, Skrillex released limited edition triple vinyl box set.

The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in two-player games such as chess. It is named after its creator Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-born American physics professor.The Elo system was invented as an improved chess rating system, but today it is also used in many other games. It is also used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a number of video games,[1] and has been adapted to team sports including association football, American college football, basketball, and Major League Baseball.Each player has a numerical rating. A higher number indicates a better player, based on results against other rated players. The winner of a contest between two players gains a certain number of points in his or her rating and the losing player loses the same amount. The number of points won or lost in a contest depends on the difference in the ratings of the players, so a player will gain more points by beating a higher-rated player than by beating a lower-rated player. In chess, for instance, if one player is rated 100 points higher than the other player, they are expected to win about five games out of eight,[citation needed] and the rating changes reflect that. Over a series of games, if a player does better than expected, based on the ratings (compared to the opponents'), his or her rating will go up.Arpad Elo was a master-level chess player and an active participant in the United States Chess Federation (USCF) from its founding in 1939.[2] The USCF used a numerical ratings system, devised by Kenneth Harkness, to allow members to track their individual progress in terms other than tournament wins and losses. The Harkness system was reasonably fair, but in some circumstances gave rise to ratings which many observers considered inaccurate. On behalf of the USCF, Elo devised a new system with a more sound statistical basis.Elo's system replaced earlier systems of competitive rewards with a system based on statistical estimation. Rating systems for many sports award points in accordance with subjective evaluations of the 'greatness' of certain achievements. For example, winning an important golf tournament might be worth an arbitrarily chosen five times as many points as winning a lesser tournament.A statistical endeavor, by contrast, uses a model that relates the game results to underlying variables representing the ability of each player.Elo's central assumption was that the chess performance of each player in each game is a normally distributed random variable. Although a player might perform significantly better or worse from one game to the next, Elo assumed that the mean value of the performances of any given player changes only slowly over time. Elo thought of a player's true skill as the mean of that player's performance random variable.A further assumption is necessary, because chess performance in the above sense is still not measurable. One cannot look at a sequence of moves and say, "That performance is 2039." Performance can only be inferred from wins, draws and losses. Therefore, if a player wins a game, he is assumed to have performed at a higher level than his opponent for that game. Conversely if he loses, he is assumed to have performed at a lower level. If the game is a draw, the two players are assumed to have performed at nearly the same level.Elo did not specify exactly how close two performances ought to be to result in a draw as opposed to a win or loss. And while he thought it is likely that each player might have a different standard deviation to his performance, he made a simplifying assumption to the contrary.To simplify computation even further, Elo proposed a straightforward method of estimating the variables in his model (i.e., the true skill of each player). One could calculate relatively easily, from tables, how many games a player is expected to win based on a comparison of his rating to the ratings of his opponents. If a player won more games than he was expected to win, his rating would be adjusted upward, while if he won fewer games than expected his rating would be adjusted downward. Moreover, that adjustment was to be in exact linear proportion to the number of wins by which the player had exceeded or fallen short of his expected number of wins.From a modern perspective, Elo's simplifying assumptions are not necessary because computing power is inexpensive and widely available. Moreover, even within the simplified model, more efficient estimation techniques are well known. Several people, most notably Mark Glickman, have proposed using more sophisticated statistical machinery to estimate the same variables. On the other hand, the computational simplicity of the Elo system has proven to be one of its greatest assets. With the aid of a pocket calculator, an informed chess competitor can calculate to within one point what his next officially published rating will be, which helps promote a perception that the ratings are fair.The USCF implemented Elo's suggestions in 1960,[3] and the system quickly gained recognition as being both more fair and accurate than the Harkness rating system. Elo's system was adopted by the World Chess Federation (FIDE) in 1970. Elo described his work in some detail in the book The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, published in 1978.Subsequent statistical tests have suggested that chess performance is almost certainly not distributed as a normal distribution, as weaker players have significantly (but not highly significantly) greater winning chances than Elo's model predicts.[citation needed] Therefore, the USCF and some chess sites use a formula based on the logistic distribution. Significant statistical anomalies have also been found when using the logistic distribution in chess.[4] FIDE continues to use the normal distribution. The normal and logistic distribution points are, in a way, arbitrary points in a spectrum of distributions which would work well. In practice both of these distributions work very well for a number of different games.The phrase "Elo rating" is often used to mean a player's chess rating as calculated by FIDE. However, this usage is confusing and often misleading, because Elo's general ideas have been adopted by many different organizations, including the USCF (before FIDE), the Internet Chess Club (ICC), Yahoo! Games, and the now-defunct Professional Chess Association (PCA). Each organization has a unique implementation, and none of them precisely follows Elo's original suggestions. It would be more accurate to refer to all of the above ratings as Elo ratings, and none of them as the Elo rating.Instead one may refer to the organization granting the rating, e.g. "As of August 2002, Gregory Kaidanov had a FIDE rating of 2638 and a USCF rating of 2742." It should be noted that the Elo ratings of these various organizations are not always directly comparable. For example, someone with a FIDE rating of 2500 will generally have a USCF rating near 2600 and an ICC rating in the range of 2500 to 3100.For top players, the most important rating is their FIDE rating. Since July 2012, FIDE issues a ratings list once every month.The following analysis of the November FIDE rating list gives a rough impression of what a given FIDE rating means:November 2011 marked the first time four players had a rating above 2800. The highest ever FIDE rating was 2851, which Garry Kasparov had on the July 1999 and January 2000 lists. A list of highest ever rated players is at Comparison of top chess players throughout history.Performance Rating is a hypothetical rating that would result from the games of a single event only. Some chess organizations use the "algorithm of 400" to calculate performance rating. According to this algorithm, performance rating for an event is calculated by taking (1) the rating of each player beaten and adding 400, (2) the rating of each player lost to and subtracting 400, (3) the rating of each player drawn, and (4) summing these figures and dividing by the number of games played.Example: 2 Wins, 2 Losses
(w+400 + x+400 + y-400 + z-400 + w + x + y + z)/4
[2w+2x+2y+2z+400(2)-400(2)]/4This can be expressed by the following formula: Performance rating = [2(Total of opponents' ratings) + 400 * (Wins - Losses)) / Games].This is a simplification because it doesn't take account of k-factors. But it offers an easy way to get an estimate of PR (Performance Rating).FIDE, however, calculates performance rating by means of the formula: Opponents' Rating Average + Rating Difference. Rating Difference  is based on a player's tournament percentage score , which is then used as the key in a lookup table where  is simply the number of points scored divided by the number of games played. Note that, in case of a perfect or no score  is 800. The full table can be found in the FIDE handbook, B. Permanent Commissions 1.0. Requirements for the titles designated in 0.31, 1.48a online. A simplified version of this table is on the right.FIDE classifies tournaments into categories according to the average rating of the players. Each category is 25 rating points wide. Category 1 is for an average rating of 2251 to 2275, category 2 is 2276 to 2300, etc. For women's tournaments, the categories are 200 rating points lower, so a Category 1 is an average rating of 2051 to 2075, etc.[5] The highest rated tournaments have been category 22, with an average from 2776 to 2800. The top categories are in the table.FIDE updates its ratings list at the beginning of each month. In contrast, the unofficial "Live ratings" calculate the change in players' ratings after every game. These Live ratings are based on the previously published FIDE ratings, so a player's Live rating is intended to correspond to what the FIDE rating would be if FIDE were to issue a new list that day.Although Live ratings are unofficial, interest arose in Live ratings in August/September 2008 when five different players took the "Live" No. 1 ranking.[6]The unofficial live ratings were published and maintained by Hans Arild Runde at the Live Rating website until August 2011. Another website www.2700chess.com has been maintained since May 2011 by Artiom Tsepotan. Both websites cover players over 2700 only.Currently, the #1 spot in both the official FIDE rating list and the live rating list is taken by Magnus Carlsen.The United States Chess Federation (USCF) uses its own classification of players:[7]In general, 1000 is considered a bright beginner. In 2007, the median rating of all USCF members was 657.[9]The K factor, in the USCF rating system, can be estimated by dividing 800 by the effective number of games a player's rating is based on (Ne) plus the number of games the player completed in a tournament (m).[10]The USCF maintains an absolute ratings floor of 100 for all ratings. Thus, no member can have a rating below 100, no matter their performance at USCF sanctioned events. However, players can have higher individual absolute ratings floors, calculated using the following formula:where  is the number of rated games won,  is the number of rated games drawn, and  is the number of events in which the player completed three or more rated games.Higher rating floors exist for experienced players who have achieved significant ratings. Such higher rating floors exist, starting at ratings of 1200 in 100 point increments up to 2100 (1200, 1300, 1400, ..., 2100). A player's rating floor is calculated by taking their peak rating, subtracting 200 points, and then rounding down to the nearest rating floor. For example, a player who has reached a peak rating of 1464 would have a rating floor of 1464  200 = 1264, which would be rounded down to 1200. Under this scheme, only Class C players and above are capable of having a higher rating floor than their absolute player rating. All other players would have a floor of at most 150.There are two ways to achieve higher rating floors other than under the standard scheme presented above. If a player has achieved the rating of Original Life Master, his or her rating floor is set at 2200. The achievement of this title is unique in that no other recognized USCF title will result in a new floor. For players with ratings below 2000, winning a cash prize of $2,000 or more raises that player's rating floor to the closest 100-point level that would have disqualified the player for participation in the tournament. For example, if a player won $4,000 in a 1750 and under tournament, the player would now have a rating floor of 1800.Since 20052006, human-computer chess matches have demonstrated that chess computers are capable of defeating even the strongest human players (Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov). However ratings of computers are difficult to quantify. There have been too few games under tournament conditions to give computers or software engines an accurate rating.[11] Also, for chess engines, the rating is dependent on the machine a program runs on.For some ratings estimates, see Chess Engine.Performance can't be measured absolutely; it can only be inferred from wins, losses, and draws against other players. A player's rating depends on the ratings of his or her opponents, and the results scored against them. The relative difference in rating between two players determines an estimate for the expected score between them. Both the average and the spread of ratings can be arbitrarily chosen. Elo suggested scaling ratings so that a difference of 200 rating points in chess would mean that the stronger player has an expected score (which basically is an expected average score) of approximately 0.75, and the USCF initially aimed for an average club player to have a rating of 1500.A player's expected score is his probability of winning plus half his probability of drawing. Thus an expected score of 0.75 could represent a 75% chance of winning, 25% chance of losing, and 0% chance of drawing. On the other extreme it could represent a 50% chance of winning, 0% chance of losing, and 50% chance of drawing. The probability of drawing, as opposed to having a decisive result, is not specified in the Elo system. Instead a draw is considered half a win and half a loss.If Player A has true strength  and Player B has true strength , the exact formula (using the logistic curve) for the expected score of Player A isSimilarly the expected score for Player B isThis could also be expressed byandwhere  and . Note that in the latter case, the same denominator applies to both expressions. This means that by studying only the numerators, we find out that the expected score for player A is  times greater than the expected score for player B. It then follows that for each 400 rating points of advantage over the opponent, the chance of winning is magnified ten times in comparison to the opponent's chance of winning.Also note that . In practice, since the true strength of each player is unknown, the expected scores are calculated using the player's current ratings.When a player's actual tournament scores exceed his expected scores, the Elo system takes this as evidence that player's rating is too low, and needs to be adjusted upward. Similarly when a player's actual tournament scores fall short of his expected scores, that player's rating is adjusted downward. Elo's original suggestion, which is still widely used, was a simple linear adjustment proportional to the amount by which a player overperformed or underperformed his expected score. The maximum possible adjustment per game (sometimes called the K-value) was set at K = 16 for masters and K = 32 for weaker players.Supposing Player A was expected to score  points but actually scored  points. The formula for updating his rating isThis update can be performed after each game or each tournament, or after any suitable rating period. An example may help clarify. Suppose Player A has a rating of 1613, and plays in a five-round tournament. He loses to a player rated 1609, draws with a player rated 1477, defeats a player rated 1388, defeats a player rated 1586, and loses to a player rated 1720. His actual score is (0 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0) = 2.5. His expected score, calculated according to the formula above, was (0.506 + 0.686 + 0.785 + 0.539 + 0.351) = 2.867. Therefore his new rating is (1613 + 32 (2.5  2.867)) = 1601, assuming that a K factor of 32 is used.Note that while two wins, two losses, and one draw may seem like a par score, it is worse than expected for Player A because his opponents were lower rated on average. Therefore he is slightly penalized. If he had scored two wins, one loss, and two draws, for a total score of three points, that would have been slightly better than expected, and his new rating would have been (1613 + 32 (3  2.867)) = 1617.This updating procedure is at the core of the ratings used by FIDE, USCF, Yahoo! Games, the ICC, and FICS. However, each organization has taken a different route to deal with the uncertainty inherent in the ratings, particularly the ratings of newcomers, and to deal with the problem of ratings inflation/deflation. New players are assigned provisional ratings, which are adjusted more drastically than established ratings.The principles used in these rating systems can be used for rating other competitionsfor instance, international football matches.Elo ratings have also been applied to games without the possibility of draws, and to games in which the result can also have a quantity (small/big margin) in addition to the quality (win/loss). See go rating with Elo for more.There are three main mathematical concerns relating to the original work of Elo, namely the correct curve, the correct K-factor, and the provisional period crude calculations.The first mathematical concern addressed by the USCF was the use of the normal distribution. They found that this did not accurately represent the actual results achieved, particularly by the lower rated players. Instead they switched to a logistic distribution model, which the USCF found provided a better fit for the actual results achieved. FIDE still uses the normal distribution as the basis for rating calculations as suggested by Elo himself.[12]The second major concern is the correct "K-factor" used. The chess statistician Jeff Sonas believes that the original K=10 value (for players rated above 2400) is inaccurate in Elo's work. If the K-factor coefficient is set too large, there will be too much sensitivity to just a few, recent events, in terms of a large number of points exchanged in each game. Too low a K-value, and the sensitivity will be minimal, and the system will not respond quickly enough to changes in a player's actual level of performance.Elo's original K-factor estimation was made without the benefit of huge databases and statistical evidence. Sonas indicates that a K-factor of 24 (for players rated above 2400) may be more accurate both as a predictive tool of future performance, and also more sensitive to performance.[13]Certain Internet chess sites seem to avoid a three-level K-factor staggering based on rating range. For example the ICC seems to adopt a global K=32 except when playing against provisionally rated players. The USCF (which makes use of a logistic distribution as opposed to a normal distribution) has staggered the K-factor according to three main rating ranges of:FIDE uses the following ranges:[14]In over-the-board chess, the staggering of the K-factor is important to ensure minimal inflation at the top end of the rating spectrum. This assumption might in theory apply equally to an online chess server, as well as a standard over-the-board chess organisation such as FIDE or USCF. In theory, it would make it harder for players to get much higher ratings if their K-factor was reduced when they got over 2400 rating. However, the ICC's help on K-factors indicates[16] that it may simply be the choosing of opponents that enables 2800+ players to further increase their rating quite easily. This would seem to hold true, for example, if one analysed the games of a grandmaster on the ICC: one can find a string of games of opponents who are all over 3100. In over-the-board chess, it would only be in very high level all-play-all events that this player would be able to find a steady stream of 2700+ opponents  in at least a category 15+ FIDE event. A category 10 FIDE event would mean players are restricted in rating between 2476 to 2500. However, if the player entered normal Swiss-paired open over-the-board chess tournaments, he would likely meet many opponents less than 2500 FIDE on a regular basis. A single loss or draw against a player rated less than 2500 would knock the GM's FIDE rating down significantly.Even if the K-factor was 16, and the player defeated a 3100+ player several games in a row, his rating would still rise quite significantly in a short period of time, due to the speed of blitz games, and hence the ability to play many games within a few days. The K-factor would arguably only slow down the increases that the player achieves after each win. The evidence given in the ICC K-factor article relates to the auto-pairing system, where the maximum ratings achieved are seen to be only about 2500. So it seems that random-pairing as opposed to selective pairing is the key for combatting rating inflation at the top end of the rating spectrum, and possibly only to a much lesser extent, a slightly lower K-factor for a player >2400 rating.In general the Elo system has increased the competitive climate for chess and inspired players for further study and improvement of their game.[citation needed] However, in some cases ratings can discourage game activity for players who wish to "protect their rating".Examples:In these examples, the rating "agenda" can sometimes conflict with the agenda of promoting chess activity and rated games.[17]Interesting from the perspective of preserving high Elo ratings versus promoting rated game activity is a recent proposal by British Grandmaster John Nunn regarding qualifiers based on Elo rating for a World championship model.[18] Nunn highlights in the section on "Selection of players", that players not only be selected by high Elo ratings, but also their rated game activity. Nunn clearly separates the "activity bonus" from the Elo rating, and only implies using it as a tie-breaking mechanism.Outside the chess world, concerns over players avoiding competitive play to protect their ratings, often referred to as "sitting on rating", are the main reason Wizards of the Coast has given for abandoning the Elo system for Magic: the Gathering tournaments in favour of a system of their own devising called "Planeswalker Points".[19][20]A more subtle issue is related to pairing. When players can choose their own opponents, they can choose opponents with minimal risk of losing, and maximum reward for winning. Such a luxury of being able to hand-pick your opponents is not present in Over-the-Board Elo type calculations, and therefore this may account strongly for the ratings on the ICC using Elo which are well over 2800.Particular examples of 2800+ rated players choosing opponents with minimal risk and maximum possibility of rating gain include: choosing computers that they know they can beat with a certain strategy; choosing opponents that they think are overrated; or avoiding playing strong players who are rated several hundred points below them, but may hold chess titles such as IM or GM. In the category of choosing overrated opponents, new-entrants to the rating system who have played fewer than 50 games are in theory a convenient target as they may be overrated in their provisional rating. The ICC compensates for this issue by assigning a lower K-factor to the established player if they do win against a new rating entrant. The K-factor is actually a function of the number of rated games played by the new entrant.Therefore, Elo ratings online still provide a useful mechanism for providing a rating based on the opponent's rating. Its overall credibility, however, needs to be seen in the context of at least the above two major issues described  engine abuse, and selective pairing of opponents.The ICC has also recently introduced "auto-pairing" ratings which are based on random pairings, but with each win in a row ensuring a statistically much harder opponent who has also won x games in a row. With potentially hundreds of players involved, this creates some of the challenges of a major large Swiss event which is being fiercely contested, with round winners meeting round winners. This approach to pairing certainly maximizes the rating risk of the higher-rated participants, who may face very stiff opposition from players below 3000, for example. This is a separate rating in itself, and is under "1-minute" and "5-minute" rating categories. Maximum ratings achieved over 2500 are exceptionally rare.An increase or decrease in the average rating over all players in the rating system is often referred to as rating inflation or rating deflation respectively. For example, if there is inflation, a modern rating of 2500 means less than a historical rating of 2500, while the reverse is true if there is deflation. Using ratings to compare players between different eras is made more difficult when inflation and deflation is present. (See also Comparison of top chess players throughout history.)It is commonly believed that, at least at the top level, modern ratings are inflated. For instance Nigel Short said in September 2009, "The recent ChessBase article on rating inflation by Jeff Sonas would suggest that my rating in the late 1980s would be approximately equivalent to 2750 in today's much debauched currency".[21] (Short's highest rating in the 1980s was 2665 in July 1988, which was equal third in the world. When he made this comment, 2665 would have ranked him 65th, while 2750 would have ranked him equal 10th. In the September 2012 FIDE rating list, 2665 would have ranked him equal 86th, while 2750 would have ranked him 13th.)It has been suggested that an overall increase in ratings reflects greater skill. The advent of strong chess computers allows a somewhat objective evaluation of the absolute playing skill of past chess masters, based on their recorded games, but this is also a measure of how computerlike the players' moves are, not merely a measure of how strongly they have played.[22]The number of people with ratings over 2700 has increased. Around 1979 there was only one active player (Anatoly Karpov) with a rating this high. In 1992 Viswanathan Anand was only the 8th player in Chess history to reach the 2700 mark at that point of time.[23] This increased to 15 players by 1994. 33 players had a 2700+ rating in 2009 and 44 as of September 2012. The current benchmark for elite players lies beyond 2800.One possible cause for this inflation was the rating floor, which for a long time was at 2200, and if a player dropped below this they were stricken from the rating list. As a consequence, players at a skill level just below the floor would only be on the rating list if they were overrated, and this would cause them to feed points into the rating pool.[22] In July 2000 the average rating of the top 100 was 2644. By July 2012 it had increased to 2703.[23]In 1995, the USCF experienced that several young scholastic players were improving faster than what the rating system was able to track. As a result, established players with stable ratings started to lose rating points to the young and underrated players. Several of the older established players were frustrated over what they considered an unfair rating decline, and some even quit chess over it.[24]Because of the significant difference in timing of when inflation and deflation occur, and in order to combat deflation, most implementations of Elo ratings have a mechanism for injecting points into the system in order to maintain relative ratings over time. FIDE has two inflationary mechanisms. First, performances below a "ratings floor" are not tracked, so a player with true skill below the floor can only be unrated or overrated, never correctly rated. Second, established and higher-rated players have a lower K-factor. New players have a K=30, which drops to K=15 after 30 played games, and to K=10 when the player reaches 2400.[25]The current system in the United States includes a bonus point scheme which feeds rating points into the system in order to track improving players, and different K-values for different players.[24] Some methods, used in Norway for example, differentiate between juniors and seniors, and use a larger K factor for the young players, even boosting the rating progress by 100% for when they score well above their predicted performance.[26]Rating floors in the USA work by guaranteeing that a player will never drop below a certain limit. This also combats deflation, but the chairman of the USCF Ratings Committee has been critical of this method because it does not feed the extra points to the improving players. A possible motive for these rating floors is to combat sandbagging, i.e. deliberate lowering of ratings to be eligible for lower rating class sections and prizes.[24]American Collegiate Football uses the Elo method as a portion of its Bowl Championship Series rating systems. Jeff Sagarin of USA Today publishes team rankings for most American sports, including Elo system ratings for College Football. The NCAA uses his Elo ratings as part of a formula to determine the annual participants in the College Football National Championship Game.National Scrabble organizations compute normally-distributed Elo ratings except in the United Kingdom, where a different system is used. The North American Scrabble Players Association has the largest rated population of active members, numbering about 2,000 as of early 2011. Lexulous also uses the Elo system.The popular First Internet Backgammon Server calculates ratings based on a modified Elo system. New players are assigned a rating of 1500, with the best humans and bots rating over 2000. The same formula has been adopted by several other backgammon sites, such as Play65, DailyGammon, GoldToken and VogClub. VogClub sets a new player's rating at 1600.The European Go Federation adopted an Elo based rating system initially pioneered by the Czech Go Federation. The Groshin's Score an Elo based game.In other sports, individuals maintain rankings based on the Elo algorithm. These are usually unofficial, not endorsed by the sport's governing body. The World Football Elo Ratings rank national teams in men's football. In 2006, Elo ratings were adapted for Major League Baseball teams by Nate Silver of Baseball Prospectus.[27] Based on this adaptation, Baseball Prospectus also makes Elo-based Monte Carlo simulations of the odds of whether teams will make the playoffs.[28] Glenn O'Brien publishes rankings using several rating systems, including variants of the Elo rating system.[29] One of the few Elo-based rankings endorsed by a sport's governing body is the FIFA Women's World Rankings, based on a simplified version of the Elo algorithm, which FIFA uses as its official ranking system for national teams in women's football.Sports-reference.com uses the Elo rating system to rate the best professional players in basketball, football, baseball (batters and pitchers rated separately), and hockey (goalies and skaters rated separately). The list changes constantly, but as of 19 July 2012, the number 1's are Magic Johnson, Johnny Unitas, Babe Ruth, Walter Johnson, Mario Lemieux, and Jacques Plante.The English Korfball Association rated teams based on Elo ratings, to determine handicaps for their cup competition for the 2011/12 season.Rugbyleagueratings.com uses the Elo rating system to rank international and club rugby league teams. As of 1 July 2012, Melbourne are rated best in Australia's NRL; Wigan are rated best in Europe's Super League.Various online games use Elo ratings for player-versus-player rankings. In Guild Wars, Elo ratings are used to record guild rating gained and lost through Guild versus Guild battles, which are two-team fights. The initial K-value was 30, but was changed to 5 in January 2007, then changed to 15 in July 2009.[30] World of Warcraft formerly used the Elo Rating system when teaming up and comparing Arena players, but now uses a system similar to Microsoft's TrueSkill.[31] The MOBA game League of Legends uses an elo rating system as well.[32] The game Puzzle Pirates uses the Elo rating system as well to determine the standings in the various puzzles. Also Roblox introduced the Elo rating in 2010.[33] Counter-Strike: Global Offensive also uses the Elo rating.[34]Despite questions of the appropriateness of using the Elo system to rate games in which luck is a factor, trading-card game manufacturers often use Elo ratings for their organized play efforts. The DCI (formerly Duelists' Convocation International) used Elo ratings for tournaments of Magic: The Gathering and other Wizards of the Coast games. However, the DCI abandoned this system in 2012 in favour of a new cumulative system of "Planeswalker Points", chiefly because of the above-noted concern that Elo encourages highly rated players to avoid playing to "protect their rating".[19][20] Pokmon USA uses the Elo system to rank its TCG organized play competitors. Prizes for the top players in various regions included holidays and world championships invites until the 2011-2012 season, where awards were based on a system of Championship Points, their rationale being the same as the DCI's for Magic: The Gathering. Similarly, Decipher, Inc. used the Elo system for its ranked games such as Star Trek Customizable Card Game and Star Wars Customizable Card Game.Moreover, online judge sites are also using Elo rating system or its derivatives. For example, TopCoder is using a modified version based on normal distribution,[35] while Codeforces is using another version based on logistic distribution.[36][37][38]The Elo rating system has been used in a crowdsourcing application for determining best quality photographs. A company called Brilliant Arc has created the "Keep/Toss" game. Two photographs are presented and workers in Amazon's Mechanical Turk simply select which photograph they believe is the better photograph. Three votes are cast for each photograph and an Elo score is determined for all photographs. The photographs with a score above a certain threshold are then selected for further processing. The results have been well received.Additionally, the Elo rating system has been exploited in soft biometrics.[39] Soft biometrics concerns the identification of individuals using human descriptions. Comparative descriptions were utilized alongside the Elo rating system to provide robust and discriminative 'relative measurements', permitting accurate identification.The Elo rating system was featured prominently in The Social Network during the algorithm scene where Mark Zuckerberg released Facemash. In the scene Eduardo Saverin writes the mathematical formula for the Elo rating system on Zuckerberg's dorm room window.1 History

The Gibson Guitar Corporation is a Nashville, Tennessee-based guitar and instrument manufacturer. It was founded in 1902 in Kalamazoo, Michigan by Orville Gibson as "The Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co., Ltd." and was a maker of mandolin instruments[1]. Gibson invented archtop guitars by using the same type of carved, arched tops found on violins. By the 1930s, the company was also making flattop acoustic guitars, as well as one of the first commercially available hollow-body electric guitars, used and popularized by Charlie Christian. It was bought by Chicago Musical Instruments in 1944, which was then acquired by the E.C.L. conglomerate that changed its name to Norlin Inc. This was seen as the beginning of an era of mismanagement.Gibson sells guitars under a variety of brand names[2] and built one of the world's most iconic guitars, the Gibson Les Paul. Many Gibson instruments are among the most collectible guitars. Gibson was at the forefront of innovation in acoustic guitars, especially in the big band era of the 1930s; the Gibson Super 400 was widely imitated. In the early 1950s, Gibson introduced its first solid-body electric guitar and in 1952 began producing its most popular guitar to datethe Les Paul, designed by Ted McCarty and Les Paul. After being purchased by the Norlin corporation in the late 1960s Gibson's quality and fortunes took a steep decline until early 1986, when the company was acquired by its present owners. Gibson Guitar is a privately held corporation owned by its chief executive officer Henry Juszkiewicz and its president David H. Berryman.Gibson has pursued legal action against manufacturers selling similar guitars and been active in environmental issues. In the late 2000s the company came under scrutiny for potential violations of the Lacey law. Authorities say wood was mislabeled to hide illegal ebony wood exports from India and that emails show an intent to illegally import rosewood and ebony wood from Madagascar. Gibson's CEO claims authorities are bullying him without filing charges. The issues has raised concerns among guitar owners on whether they could be punished for unknowingly owning guitars with illegally obtained wood, which led to some initiatives to protect individual consumers from the Lacey Act. 1920 F-4    1917 H-2
 1924 K-4 mando-celloOrville Gibson (born 1856, Chateaugay, New York) started making mandolins in Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States. The mandolins were distinctive in that they featured a carved, arched solid wood top and back and carved wood sides. Prior to this, mandolins had a flat solid wood top and a bowl-like back similar to a lute. These bowl-back mandolins were very fragile and unstable. Disdainful of the shape, Orville Gibson characterized them as "potato bugs". Gibson's innovation made a distinctive, darker-sounding mandolin that was easier to manufacture in large numbers. Orville Gibson's mandolin design, with its single-pieced carved sides and a single-pieced neck, was patented in 1898; it would be the only innovation he patented. Orville Gibson died in 1918 of endocarditis (inflammation of the inside lining of the heart chambers and valves).[3]Orville Gibson began to sell his unique instruments in 1894 out of a one-room workshop in Kalamazoo Michigan. In 1902 Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co, Ltd. was incorporated to market the instruments. Initially, the company produced only Orville Gibson's original designs. Aware of changing trends, the company hired designer Lloyd Loar in 1919 to create newer instruments.[4]During the 1920s Gibson was responsible for many innovations in banjo, guitar and mandolin design. In 1922, the Gibson F5 mandolin model was introduced. That particular model later became known as the ultimate bluegrass mandolin. Gibson soon became the leading manufacturer of archtop guitars, particularly the L-5 model, also a Loar design. Loar left the company in 1924.[5]In the 1930s, Gibson began exploring the concept of an electric guitar. In 1936 they introduced their first "Electric Spanish" model, the ES-150. Other companies were producing electric guitars but the Gibson is generally recognized as the first commercially successful electric guitar. Other instruments were also "electrified"; such as steel guitars, banjos and mandolins.During World War II, instrument manufacturing basically stopped at Gibson due to shortages of wood and metal. Only a few instruments were made with whatever parts were at hand. Gibson did war production instead, making wood parts for various military needs. Such shortages continued for a few years after the war and the only notable change occurred in 1946 when the Gibson name on the instrument headstock changed from a cursive script to the block style used to this day. This is seen at the head of the information block at top.In 1944 Gibson was purchased by Chicago Musical Instruments, which took over marketing and sales of Gibson products while allowing the Kalamazoo factory to operate largely independently.The ES-175 was introduced in 1949. The model has seen some variations over the years but it is still in production.In 1948, Gibson hired music industry veteran Ted McCarty, who was promoted to company president in 1950. During his tenure (19501966), Gibson greatly expanded and diversified its line of instruments. The first notable addition was the "Les Paul" guitar. McCarty was well aware of the strong sales of the Fender Telecaster. In 1950, Gibson decided to make a solid-body guitar of its own according to its own design philosophy despite the fact many other guitar manufacturers were contemptuous of the concept of a solid-body guitar. Designed by the guitarist Les Paul, it was released as his signature model in 1952. The "Les Paul" was offered in several models, including the Custom, the Standard, the Special, and the Junior.[6]In the mid-50s, the Thinline series was produced. Many guitarists did not like the bulk of a full-size archtop and wanted a thinner guitar. The Byrdland was the first produced. The first Byrdlands were slim, custom built, L-5 models for guitarists Billy Byrd and Hank Garland. Later, a shorter neck was added. Other guitarists who tried Gibson samples liked the idea and the model went into production. Other models such as the ES-350T and the ES-225T were introduced as less costly alternatives.[7]In 1958, Gibson introduced the ES-335T model. Similar in size to the hollow-body Thinlines, the ES-335 family had a solid center, giving the string tone a longer sustain.In the late 50s, McCarty was aware that Gibson was perceived as a "conservative" company, generally making traditionally shaped instruments. He decided to change that. In 1958, Gibson produced two new designs: the eccentrically shaped Explorer and Flying V. These "modernistic" guitars did not sell initially. It was only in the late 1960s and early 70s when the two guitars were reintroduced to the market that they sold very well. The Firebird, in the early 60s, was a reprise of the modernistic idea, though less extreme. In the 1950s, Gibson also produced the Tune-o-matic bridge system and its version of the humbucking pickup, the PAF ("Patent Applied For"), first released in 1957 and still sought after for its sound.[citation needed]In 1961 the body design of the Les Paul was changed due to the demand for a double-cutaway body design.[8] Les Paul did not care for the new body style and let his endorsement lapse. The new body design then became known as the SG (for "solid guitar"). The Les Paul returned to the Gibson catalog in 1968 due to the influence of players such as Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Peter Green. Both the Les Paul and the SG became very popular with rock and roll and blues guitar players.On December 22nd 1969 Gibson parent company, Chicago Musical Instruments, was taken over by a South American brewing conglomerate, E.C.L. Gibson, Inc. remained under the control of CMI until 1974, when it became a subsidiary of Norlin Musical Instruments (a member of Norlin Industries - named for ECL president Norton Stevens and CMI president Maurice Berlin). This began an era widely perceived as being characterized by corporate mismanagement and decreasing product quality similar to Fender's period under CBS ownership.Between 1974 and 1984 production of Gibson guitars was shifted from Kalamazoo to Nashville, Tennessee. Early Nashville-built guitars suffered from both inexperienced workers and climate-control problems in the humid South.[citation needed] The Kalamazoo plant was kept going for a few years as a custom-instrument shop, but was closed in 1984; several Gibson employees led by plant manager Jim Duerloo established Heritage Guitars in the old factory, building versions of classic Gibson designs. The company was within three months of going out of business before it was bought by Henry E. Juszkiewicz, David H. Berryman, and Gary A. Zebrowski in January 1986.[9] The survival and success of Gibson today is largely attributed[by whom?] to this change in ownership.[citation needed] Currently, Juszkiewicz is CEO and Berryman is president. More recently new production plants have been opened, such as Memphis, Tennessee, as well as Bozeman, Montana. The Memphis facility is used for semi-hollow and custom shop instruments, while the Bozeman facility is dedicated to acoustic instruments.In mid 2009 Gibson reduced its work force to adjust for a decline in guitar industry sales in the United States.[10]In 2011, Gibson acquired the Stanton Group, including Cerwin Vega!, KRK Systems and Stanton DJ. Gibson then formed a new division, Gibson Pro Audio, which will deliver professional grade audio items, including headphones, loudspeakers and DJ equipment.[11]Gibson announced a partnership with the Japanese-based Onkyo Corporation in 2012. Onkyo, known for audio equipment and home theater systems, became part of the Gibson Pro Audio division.[12]Gibson also owns and makes instruments under such brands as Baldwin,[2] Epiphone,[13] Kalamazoo,[citation needed] Kramer,[14] Maestro,[15] Slingerland,[2] Steinberger,[16] Tobias,[17] Valley Arts[citation needed] and Wurlitzer.[2]Gibson purchased Garrison Guitars in 2007.[18]Gibson models may not be easily identified by serial number alone,[19][20] and as of 1999 the company has used six distinct serial numbering systems.[19] By 2006, that number had risen to seven.[20]In 1977, Gibson introduced the serial numbering system in use until 2006.[20] An eight digit number on the back shows the date on which the instrument was produced, where it was produced and its order of production that day (e.g. first instrument stamped that day, second, etc.).[19]An exception is the year 1994, Gibson's centennial year; many 1994 serial numbers start with "94", followed by a 6-digit production number[citation needed].The Gibson website provides a book to help with serial number deciphering.[19]In 2006 Gibson introduced a 9 digit serial number system.[20] The system is largely the same as the 8 digit system used since 1977,[19] but the 6th digit now represents a batch number.[20]In 2003,[21] Gibson debuted its ethernet-based[22] communications protocol, MaGIC, which it had developed in partnership with 3COM, Advanced Micro Devices and Xilinx.[21] Replacing traditional analog hook-ups with a digital connection that would, "satisfy the unique requirements of live audio performances" may have been the goal of this project.[22]This system may require a special pickup,[21] but cabling is provided by standard Cat-5 ethernet cord.[21][22]The Gibson "self-tuning guitar", also known as a "robot model", an option on some newer Les Paul, SG, Flying V and Explorer instruments,[citation needed] will tune itself in little more than two seconds using robotics technology developed by Tronical GmbH.[23]Gibson's corporate social responsibility efforts include a participation in Music Rising, which facilitated the replacement of tens of thousands of privately owned, hurricane-damaged instruments.[2]Gibson has sought legal action against those that make and sell guitars too-similar to their own.In 1977 Gibson sued Hoshino/Elger for copying the Gibson Les Paul.[citation needed]In 2000, Gibson sued Fernandes Guitars in a Tokyo court for allegedly copying Gibson designs. Gibson did not prevail.[24]Gibson also sued PRS Guitars in 2005, to stop them from making their Singlecut model. The lawsuit against PRS was initially successful.[25] However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the lower court decision and ordered the dismissal of Gibson's suit against PRS.[26]Gibson makes authorized copies of its most successful guitar designs. They are less expensive than those bearing the Gibson name. A former competitor, Epiphone was purchased by Gibson and now makes competitively priced Gibson models, such as the Les Paul, sold under the Epiphone brand,[27] while continuing to make Epiphone-specific models like the Sheraton and Casino. In Japan, Orville by Gibson once made Gibson designs sold in that country.[28]Gibson has come under scrutiny for importing illegal rare wood in violation of the Lacey Act.[29] Two police raids of Gibson factories found ebony wood from India with misleading labels authorities say were used to hide violations of Indian export law.[29] At the time, Gibson claimed the labeling was a mistake and that the transaction was approved by Indian authorities.[29]On November 17, 2009, federal authorities seized six guitars and several pallets of alleged endangered and illegal, rare ebony wood that Gibson had purchased and stored at their factory.[30][31] During the course of the investigation, Henry E. Juszkiewicz, CEO and Chairman of Gibson Guitar Corporation, took a leave of absence as a board member of the Rainforest Alliance.[32]In January 2011, Gibson Guitar filed a motion to recover the materials seized in the raid and to overturn the charges made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.[33][34] The court denied the motion. According to reports that quote a special agent on the case, the prosecution expected to use the material as evidence.[34]On June 2011, the United States Department of Justice filed a civil case against Gibson. Authorities said Gibson sourced unfinished rosewood and ebony, in the form of blanks, from Nagel, Germany, which obtained it exclusively from a supplier in Madagascar. Gibson acquired the ebony to manufacture fingerboards. Madagascar prohibits the logging of ebony wood and export of unfinished ebony. The filing also mentioned internal e-mails from 2008 and 2009 that discussed plans to harvest ebony wood and rosewood in Madagascar.[35][36] The case against Gibson Guitar was the first under the amended Lacey Act, which requires importing companies to purchase legally harvested wood and follow the environmental laws of the producing countries.[36]Gibson Guitar's offices and factories in Nashville and Memphis were raided again by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife on August 24, 2011. Details were not released about the nature of the raid or what was found due to the ongoing legal proceedings.[30] According to a statement issued by Gibson Guitar the following day, these raids focused on rare wood imported from India.[37][38] In the release, Gibson said authorities were "bullying Gibson without filing charges" and stating further: "Gibson has complied with foreign laws and believes it is innocent of any wrong doing. We will fight aggressively to prove our innocence." He also criticized the government's use of the Lacey Act because it interprets and enforces the laws of other nations.[37][39] The case against Gibson had become popular among right-wing politicians and the Tea Party movement, which fought the environmental legislation.[40]The case was settled on August 6, 2012, with Gibson admitting to violating the Lacey Act and agreeing to pay a fine of $300,000 in addition to a $50,000 community payment. Gibson also forfeited the wood seized in the raids, which was valued at roughly the same amount at the settlement.[40] Had Gibson not settled, it could have also faced felony charges that might have resulted in jail terms for the executives involved.[41] Although the Rainforest Alliance certified the wood used by Gibson Guitar,[36] its FSC certificates only applied to specific product lines. If wood was sourced from Madagascar, the wood could not have been used in products labeled or sold as FSC-certified.[41]The case has also raised concerns for musicians who lack documentation of vintage instruments made of traditional, non-sustainable materials.[29][42] However, senior officials from the Justice Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have stated that musicians who unknowingly possess instruments made from illegal wood would not be treated as criminals. Instead, they insisted that the government's aim is to target individuals and businesses that profit from the trafficking of these protected species. Despite these assurances, lobbying efforts by Juszkiewicz resulted in a proposed bill that would protect musicians who unknowingly possess materials that violate the Lacey Act, while also exempting wood supplies purchased by companies before May 22, 2008, and requiring the government publish a database of illegal wood sources for the public.[43]1 History

Barbara Gordon is a fictional character, a superheroine appearing in comic books published by DC Comics and in related media. The character was created by Gardner Fox and Carmine Infantino. At the request of the producers of the 1960s Batman television series, DC editor Julius Schwartz called for a new female counterpart to the superhero Batman that could be introduced into publication and the third season of the show simultaneously. The character subsequently made her first comic book appearance as Batgirl in Detective Comics No. 359 titled, "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!" (1967) by writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino.[1] Written as the daughter of Gotham City police commissioner James Gordon, her civilian identity is given a doctorate in library science and she is employed as head of Gotham City Public Library, as well as later being elected to the United States Congress.In addition to appearing in other DC publications, she receives her first starring role in Batman Family which debuted in 1975, partnered with the original Robin, Dick Grayson. In 1988, following the editorial retirement of the character's Batgirl persona in Barbara Kesel's Batgirl Special No. 1, Alan Moore's graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke depicts the Joker shooting her through the spinal cord in her civilian identity, resulting in paraplegia. In subsequent stories, editor Kim Yale and writer John Ostrander establish the character as a computer expert and information broker known as Oracle. Providing intelligence and computer hacking services to assist other superheroes, she makes her first appearance as Oracle in Suicide Squad No. 23 (1989). She is featured in the one-shot comic Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey (1996) written by Chuck Dixon, which later became the monthly title Birds of Prey starring both characters. The series depicts her as a great intellect uninhibited by her paralysis, skilled in the martial art of eskrima. Employing Black Canary as her partner and field agent, Oracle later operates as the leader of a full team of female crimefighters who engage in global espionage missions, under writer Gail Simone. In 2011, following a company wide relaunch of all DC Comics titles, the character's mobility is restored and she is given a starring role in the eponymous Batgirl monthly comic, as well as Birds of Prey, as part of The New 52.Barbara Gordon is described as one of the most popular characters to appear during the Silver Age of Comic Books and is also regarded as a pop icon due to her appearances in the Batman television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the Modern Age of Comic Books under the Birds of Prey publication and as a disability icon. The character has been the subject of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and people living with disabilities in mainstream media. The events of The Killing Joke, which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books, to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabled characters existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world. Barbara Gordon, as both Batgirl and Oracle, has been adapted into various media relating to the Batman franchise, including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. In 2011, she was ranked 17th in both Comics Buyer's Guide's "100 Sexiest Women in Comics" and IGN's "Top 100 Comic Books Heroes".[2][3]Prior to the introduction of Barbara Gordon, the Batwoman character and her side-kick Bat-Girl appeared in Batman-related publications, but were eventually removed at the direction of editor Julius Schwartz for being outdated and unrealistic. Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the Batman television series of the 1960s.[4] When producers William Dozier and Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating "Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the 50s but she had nothing to do with a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. I knew we could do a lot better, so Julie and I came up with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her own TV show."[5] Yvonne Craig portrayed the character in the show's third season.[6] Barbara Gordon and alter ego Batgirl debuted in Detective Comics No. 359, "The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl" (1967), as the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon. In the debut story, while driving to a costume ball dressed as a female version of Batman, Barbara Gordon intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the super villain Killer Moth, attracting Batman's attention and leading to a crime-fighting career. Although Batman insists she give up crime-fighting because of her gender, Batgirl disregards his objections.[7]In her civilian identity, Barbara Gordon, Ph.D., is depicted as a career woman with a doctorate in library science, as well as being head of Gotham City public library, "presumably one of the largest public libraries in the DC Comics version of reality."[8] Barbara Gordons Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in Detective Comics No. 417 (1971),[9] stating: "I'd like to say a few words about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back... They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman's life. But thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor, these hapless females are gone for good. In their place stands a girl who is a capable crime-fighter, a far cry from Batwoman who constantly had to be rescued [by] Batman."[10]Batgirl continues to appear in DC Comics publications throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, as a supporting character in Detective Comics, in addition to guest appearances in various titles such as Justice League of America,[11] World's Finest Comics,[12] The Brave and the Bold,[13] Action Comics,[14] and Superman.[15] In the mid-1970s, Batgirl reveals her secret identity to her father (who had already discovered it on his own), and serves as a member of the United States House of Representatives. She moves to Washington, D.C., intending to give up her career as Batgirl and in June 1972, appeared in a story entitled "Batgirl's Last Case."[16] Julius Schwartz brought her back a year later in Superman No. 268 (1973),[17] in which she has a blind date with Clark Kent, establishing their friendship, and fights alongside Superman. Batgirl and Superman team up twice more, in Superman No. 279 and DC Comics Presents #19. Batgirl also guest-starred in other Superman related titles such as No. 453 of Adventure Comics, and in Superman Family No. 171, where she teams with Supergirl. The character is given a starring role in DC's Batman Family comic book which debuted in 1975.[18] The original Robin Dick Grayson became her partner in the series and the two were frequently referred to as the "Dynamite Duo: Batgirl & Robin." Batgirl meets Batwoman in Batman Family No. 10, when the retired superhero briefly returns to crime-fighting (before Kane is murdered by the Bronze Tiger). The two fight Killer Moth and Cavalier, and learn each other's secret identities. Batwoman retires once again at the conclusion of the story, leaving Batgirl to continue crime-fighting.[19] Although this series ended after three years of publication,[20] Batgirl continued to appear in back up stories published in Detective Comics through issue No. 519 (October 1982).Crisis on Infinite Earths, a limited miniseries published in 1985, was written in order to reduce the complex history of DC Comics to a single continuity. Although Batgirl is a featured character, her role is relatively smallshe delivers Supergirl's eulogy in issue seven of the 12-part series.[21] The conclusion of Crisis on Infinite Earths changed DC Universe continuity in many ways. Following the reboot, Barbara Gordon is born to Roger and Thelma Gordon, and she is Jim Gordon's niece/adopted daughter in current canon. Post-Crisis, Supergirl does not arrive on Earth until after Gordon has established herself as Oracle; many adventures she shared with Batgirl are retroactively described as having been experienced by Power Girl. In Secret Origins #20: Batgirl and the Golden Age Dr. Mid-Nite (1987),[22] Barbara Gordon's origin is rebooted by author Barbara Randal. Within the storyline, Gordon recounts the series of events that lead to her career as Batgirl, including her first encounter with Batman as a child, studying martial arts under the tutelage of a sensei, memorizing maps and blue prints of the city, excelling in academics in order to skip grades, and pushing herself to become a star athlete.DC officially retired the hero in the one-shot comic Batgirl Special No. 1 (July 1988), written by Barbara Kesel.[23] Later that year, she appears in Alan Moore's Batman: The Killing Joke. In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon in an attempt to drive her father insane, thereby proving to Batman that anyone can be morally compromised. Although events in The Killing Joke exert a great impact on the character, the story has little to do with her.[24] She is deployed as a plot device to cement the Jokers vendetta against Commissioner Gordon and Batman. In 2006, during an interview with Wizard, Moore expressed regret over his treatment of the character calling it "shallow and ill-conceived."[25] He stated prior to writing the graphic novel, "I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordonwho was Batgirl at the timeand if I remember, I spoke to Len Wein, who was our editor on the project," and following a discussion with then-Executive Editorial Director Dick Giordano, "Len got back onto the phone and said, Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.'"[25] Although there has been speculation as to whether or not editors at DC specifically intended to have the character's paralysis become permanent, Brian Cronin, author of Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed (2009) noted that DC had hired Barbara Kesel to write the Batgirl Special specifically to retire the character and set her in place for The Killing Joke.[26] Gail Simone included the character's paralysis in a list of "major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered", dubbing the phenomenon "Women in Refrigerators" in reference to a 1994 Green Lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend's mutilated body in his refrigerator.[27] Following the release of the graphic novel, comic book editor and writer Kim Yale discussed how distasteful she found the treatment of Barbara Gordon with her husband, fellow comic writer John Ostrander. Rather than allow the character to fall into obscurity, the two decided to revive her as a character living with a disability.[28]Yale and Ostrander oversaw the development of Barbara Gordon's new persona as Oracle for the next several years.[28] The character made her first comic book appearance as Oracle in Suicide Squad No. 23, anonymously offering her services to the government's Task Force X.[29][30] In the following two years, Oracle, under pen of Ostrander and Yale, made guest appearances in various DC titles until her identity was revealed to be Barbara Gordon in Suicide Squad No. 38 (1990) and she officially becomes a member of the Squad in issue No. 48 following an invitation from Amanda Waller. In 1992, Dennis ONeil wrote Oracle as Batmans sole source of information in Batman: Sword of Azrael #1. This newly forged partnership established Oracles status as Batman's intellectual equal.[31] She is subsequently featured in the 12-issue miniseries The Hacker Files (1993).[32] In "Oracle: Year One"a story arc contained in The Batman Chronicles No. 5 (1996)Yale and Ostrander tell the origin of Barbara Gordon's new persona as Oracle. Initially, Gordon's paralysis plunges her into a state of reactive depression. However, she soon realizes that her aptitude for and training in information sciences have provided her with tremendous skills that could be deployed to fight crime. In a world increasingly centered on technology and information, she possesses a genius-level intellect; photographic memory; deep knowledge of computers and electronics; expert skills as a hacker; and graduate training in library sciences. One night, she has a dream in which an all-knowing woman (similar to Oracle at Delphi of Greek mythology) has her own face; it's then that she adopts "Oracle" as her codename. She serves as an information broker, gathering and disseminating intelligence to law enforcement organizations and members of the superhero community. She trains under the tutelage of Richard Dragon, one of DC's premiere martial artists, to engage in combat (using eskrima) from her wheelchair. She develops her upper-body strength and targeting skills with both firearms and batarangs.[33]The success of Chuck Dixons Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey (1996) led to the comic series Birds of Prey starring the two title characters.[34] During Chuck Dixon's crossover series Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle,[35] Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long-term friendship. They form the nucleus of the Birds of Prey organization. While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations, Black Canary becomes her full-time employee and field agent. In 2000, the first Batgirl monthly comic was launched with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series, acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl, alongside Batman. Gail Simone took over as writer of Birds of Prey with issue No. 56, taking the series in a "Bold New Direction!" In an interview, Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon stating: "Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant master computer operator and one of the most fascinating characters in comics. From there, Chuck Dixon did wonderful things with her in his Birds of Prey run ... Shes fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself, shes tremendously compelling. The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place."[36] Simone integrates the Huntress into the comic, making her a central character in the series as Oracle's secondary field agent. In 2003, comic book authors Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordons origin with the miniseries Batgirl: Year One.[37] Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early, but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to vigilantism in the previous origin myths.During the 2004 crossover event Batman: War Games,[38] Black Mask commandeers Oracle's computers and satellites and engages in a fight to the death with Batman. In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005),[39] and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005),[40] Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.During the company wide crossover Infinite Crisis (2005),[41] Oracle teams with the Martian Manhunter in Metropolis to coordinate a counterstrike to the Secret Society's global jailbreak. The renewed romance between Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson is also cut short by the Infinite Crisis storyline.[42] When DC continuity jumps forward one year after the events of Infinite Crisis, Oracle and her team continue to work in Metropolis. Oracle works with Batman, although not on a regular basis as before. Oracle continues to lead the Birds of Prey, and expands the ranks of the operation. In Birds of Prey No. 99, Black Canary leaves the team and the Huntress becomes the team's de facto field leader, while Big Barda has been brought in as the group's heavy-hitter alongside a larger, rotating roster; Oracle also makes an attempt to reforge her alliance with Power Girl, however, when Oracle invites her to rejoin the team, she replies that she will do so "when Hell freezes over."[43] In the crossover event Countdown to Final Crisis (2007),[44] Oracle dispatches the Question and Batwoman to capture Trickster and Piper following their role in the murder of Bart Allen. She struggles to keep the identities of the world's heroes from being stolen and coordinates the response to a global crisis engineered by the Calculator, a villainous hacker and information broker. In issue No. 5 of the comic book series The All-New Booster Gold (2007),[45] the title hero is given the mission of traveling back in time in order to prevent "a tragedy that he discovers never should've happenedthe Joker shooting and paralyzing Barbara Gordon, Batgirl."[45] Although Booster Gold makes several attempts to prevent the events which took place in Batman: The Killing Joke, he ultimately fails and Barbara Gordon's chronological history remains unchanged.In "Whitewater," Gail Simone's final story arc on Birds of Prey (2007),[46] Oracle and her team struggle for power with Spy Smasher, a government agent who has taken over the Birds of Prey organization. Eventually, Spy Smasher is forced to admit her defeat and returns control of the Birds of Prey organization to Oracle. At the conclusion of the arc, Oracle also adopts Misfit into the Birds of Prey. Sean McKeever temporarily took over as author of Birds of Prey, writing issues #113117, Birds of Prey: Metropolis or Dust (2008). The following arch of the series Birds of Prey: Platinum Flats (2008) is written by Tony Bedard. In the company-wide 2008 Final Crisis storyline, Darkseidwho has finally gained control of the Anti-Life Equationattempts to put the mind-control equation on the internet. Both Oracle and Mister Terrific make desperate attempts to stop Darkseid, even attempting to shut down the entire Internet. Unfortunately, they both fail and those affected ended up mindless slaves of Darkseid. Freed from Darkseid's control after the restoration of the Multiverse, she attempts to shut down the criminal Unternet set up by her opposite number, the Calculator, as a Darkseid-free replacement for the regular Internet and still used by tech-savvy criminals. However, the Calculator, preventing her moves, takes control of the Kilg%re, gaining the ability to thrive in cyberspace by controlling digital and cybernetic avatars, and tracks Oracle down with his newfound powers. Even though Oracle foils him, she starts doubting her abilities and fears she's losing her edge and brilliance, which results in her disbanding the Birds of Prey team to do some soul-searching.[47] Birds of Prey received cancellation in early 2009, with the final issue being #127.Oracle is subsequently featured in a limited series written by Kevin VanHook titled Oracle: The Cure, a crossover arch with Batman: Battle for the Cowl (2009). The story chronologically follows the events of Final Crisis and Batman R.I.P. (2008). Oracle has returned to Gotham, and although the Birds of Prey are disbanded, she continues to summon them to help Nightwing and Robin deal with the growing crime in Gotham. The Calculator's plans finally come to their fruition, and Kuttler, hoping to save his dying daughter Wendy takes on the "Babbage" alias and begins prowling the digital world of Alta Viva, a virtual world game, for fragments of the Anti-Life Equation unleashed by Darkseid. Oracle, now living in a dilapidated rented apartment in Gotham, becomes aware of Kuttler's activities after "Cheesefiend", one of her informants, is brutally killed, with the Anti-Life Equation itself, after coming in contact with Babbage.[48] Hoping to stop the Calculator and prevent him from piecing together the fragments of the Anti-Life Equation in his possession, Oracle travels to Hong Kong, hoping to steal them back by the means of an advanced supercomputer programmed to track the chunk of data left behind by Babbage. However the Calculator discovers her attempts, swearing vengeance upon her.[49] She manages to defeat Calculator, rendering the Anti-Life Equation's fragments useless.[50]In 2009, the Batgirl comic book was relaunched with Stephanie Brown starring as the title character. Although Oracle initially tries to discourage Brown from crime-fighting, she eventually comes to accept her as Batgirl. In addition, she also mentors the Calculator's daughter, Wendy Harris, who was crippled following an attack at Titans Tower.[51] Oracle later takes a job as an assistant professor at Gotham University.[52] During the Green Lantern limited series Blackest Night, Hal Jordan crashes into the Bat-Signal after a fight with the Black Lantern Martian Manhunter. Oracle and Commissioner Gordon are both present.[53] Origins & Omens hints towards an involvement in the storyline. After sending Green Lantern's intel to every superhero community across the planet of the Black Lanterns, the Gordons find themselves being attacked by the original Dark Knight's deceased rogue gallery members, who are all reanimated by the Black Lantern Corps. Oracle and her father are forced to fight for their lives as they witness the Black Lanterns are massacring everyone on sight at Gotham Central. During the crisis, Oracle is rendered unconscious by an explosion and is possessed by Deadman, who uses Oracle's body to save Commissioner Gordon from the reanimated King Snake and the Trigger Twins. After being rescued by Batman, Robin, and Red Robin, the Gordons were attacked by Batman and Red Robin's parents with their saviors, the reanimated Graysons and the Drakes. While Grayson and Drake battle the Black Lanterns, Robin takes the Gordons to their underground base where Alfred tends her and her father's wounds.[54]In Greg Rucka's Detective Comics No. 862, Barbara Gordon is approached by Huntress and Renee Montoya (the new Question) for help in tracking down a mysterious criminal who ordered a hit on them. Montoya is flabbergasted upon discovering that "Commissioner Gordon's daughter" is a superhero.[55] In 2010, Birds of Prey was relaunched with Gail Simone returning to write the comic. The first arch is a tie-in with the Green Lantern Brightest Day limited series. Oracle reforms the Birds of Prey, this time with Dove and the recently resurrected Hawk as members.[56] A new villainess calling herself the White Canary begins menacing the Birds, and publicly reveals Black Canary's civilian identity and frames her for a murder. While the team contends with White Canary in the streets of Gotham, Oracle is kidnapped by her former associates, Savant and Creote.[57][58] This is eventually revealed to be a ruse in order to trick White Canary. Following the team's victory against White Canary, Oracle fakes her death during a battle with Calculator.[59] With most of the criminal underworld now believing that she is dead, Oracle cuts off ties with all but a select few Gotham heroes, and is shown refusing to help Blue Beetle, Manhunter, and Booster Gold when they attempt to call her for assistance during battle.[60]In Grant Morrison's Batman: The Return (2010), an installment of the limited series Bruce Wayne: The Road Home (2010), Batman enlists Oracle's to help him run Batman Incorporated, a new global team of Batmen. He tasks her with helping him fight crime on a virtual front, and shows her a new modified Batgirl design that acts as her virtual avatar.[61] Oracle is later shown directing Cassandra Cain, now known as Blackbat, on a mission in Hong Kong, where she captures some heroin smugglers for Batman.[62] In Scott Snyder's Black Mirror storyline, Barbara Gordon is kidnapped by her brother, James Gordon Jr., who had returned to Gotham after a lengthy absence to become a serial killer.[63] He stabs her in both of her legs, positioning the knives so that if she removes them, she will bleed to death. As she slowly bleeds, she is able to use her wits to distract him long enough for Batman and Commissioner Gordon to arrive and defeat her brother.[64]In September, 2011, following the company-wide relaunch, Barbara Gordon stars in a new Batgirl seriesone of The New 52 titles featuring the company's most iconic characters. The conclusion of the limited series Flashpoint (2011) establishes a new continuity within the DC Universe, with all characters regressing to an younger age and earlier stage in their careers, while remaining in a modern timeline. DC Senior VP of Sales, Bob Wayne, explained that with each of their titles reverting back to issue No. 1, "our creative teams have the ability to take a more modern approachnot only with each character, but with how the characters interact with one another and the universe as a whole, and focus on the earlier part of the careers of each of our iconic characters."[65] Wayne also stated that "The Killing Joke still happened and she was Oracle. Now she will go through physical rehabilitation and become a more seasoned and nuanced character because she had these incredible and diverse experiences.[65] Public reaction to the change has been mixed, and has included criticism that DC has reduced the diversity of their character lineup, as well as "being disrespectful of the power the character had gained as a symbol to the disabled community in her role as Oracle."[66][67][68] Dan DiDio, Co-Publisher of DC Comics explained the decision by stating that "[w]e didn't want to turn our back on the diversity issue, but she'll always be the most recognizable [Batgirl]. We are working with concerns to diversify the line. We're always looking to re-position to be reflective of today's audience."[69] Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: "For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises. Its a bit of a shock, to be sure, but were doing everything we can to be respectful to this characters amazing legacy, while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics readers will be experiencing for the first time... Barbara Gordon leaping, fighting, and swinging over Gotham. Now, when citizens of that city look up, they are going to see BATGIRL. And that is absolutely thrilling."[70]In the new, revised continuity, the events of The Killing Joke took place three years before the current storyline, and while it is established she was paraplegic during that time, Barbara Gordon is written as having regained her mobility after undergoing experimental surgery at a South African clinic.[71] Series writer Gail Simone stated that while the character is "one of the smartest and toughest women in comics... One thing the book is truly about, is that the after-effects of something like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) or other trauma-related syndromes, can strike even very smart, very intellectually tough people, even soldiers and cops", a subject that is generally overlooked in comic books.[71] She also explained the method of the character's recovery is based upon real life experiences in that "some of the best real world work in the field of mobility rehabilitation is coming from South Africa. People have been talking about this as if it's some sort of mystical thing like returning from the dead, but there are treatments and surgeries that can restore mobility in some cases. Barbara's spine was not severed. That makes her a candidate."[71]Prior to release, Batgirl No. 1 sold out at the distribution level with over 100,000 copies printed in its first run according to Diamond Comic Distributors. Along with Action Comics No. 1, Justice League No. 1, Batman No. 1, Batman and Robin No. 1, Batman: The Dark Knight No. 1, Detective Comics No. 1, Flash No. 1, Green Lantern No. 1, and Superman No. 1, retailers were required to order a second printing.[72][73] Calvin Reid of Publishers Weekly states in a review of the first issue: "The artwork is okay though conventional, while Simones script tries to tie up of the end of the previous Barbara Gordon/Oracle storyline and setup up the new Batgirl. Her formula: murderous villains, blood splattering violence and high flying superheroics mixed with single-white-female bonding... plus a cliffhanger ending to the first issue that offers a nifty [segue] into the new world of Barbara Gordon and Batgirl."[74] The New York Times critic George Gene Gustines wrote: "Unlike some of the other DC comics I read this week, Batgirl achieves a deft hat trick: a well-shaped reintroduction to a character, an elegant acknowledgement of fundamental history and the establishment of a new status quo. This is a must-buy series."[75] Earning a B+ rating in a review from Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker writes that Simone "[takes] her Birds of Prey storytelling powers and focuses them on the newly revived Barbara Gordon as Batgirl. The result is a burst of exhilaration, as Barbara/Batgirl revels in her new freedom even as she encounters a so-far not-terribly-chilling villain called Mirror."[76]Since the series relaunch in September 2011, Batgirl has remained within the top 30 of the 300 best-selling monthly comic book publications sold in North America. Monthly estimated sales figures are as follows: Batgirl No. 1 with 81,489 copies (ranked 12th overall),[77] Batgirl No. 2 with 75,227 (ranked 14th),[78] Batgirl No. 3 with 62,974 (ranked 18th),[79] Batgirl No. 4 with 53,975 (ranked 23rd),[80] Batgirl No. 5 with 51,327 (ranked 26th),[81] and Batgirl No. 6 with 47,836 (ranked 30th).[82] The harcover edition of volume 1, Batgirl: The Darkest Reflection, which collects issues #1-6, made the The New York Times Best Seller list, alongside Animal Man: The Hunt, Batman & Robin: Born to Kill, Batman: Detective Comics, Wonder Woman: Blood, Batwoman: Hydrology, Green Lantern: Sinestro.[83]Additionally, Barbara Gordon makes an appearance in Birds of Prey No. 1, where Black Canary offers her a spot on the new Birds of Prey roster. She declines Canary's invitation, suggesting that Katana take her place instead.[84] Series writer Duane Swierczynski has stated that Batgirl will join the team in issue #4.[85] He commented that while she "is an essential part of this team", she is not the focus of the series, as she is hesitant to be associated with the other characters because of their status as outlaws.[86]Various alterations of the Barbara Gordon character have appeared in storylines published in and out of mainstream continuity titles. Variants of the character within continuity often appear in stories which involve time travel, such as the crossover limited series Zero Hour: Crisis in Time, a follow-up story preceded by the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths which altered mainstream continuity. Notable imprints of DC Comics such as Elseworlds and All Star DC Comics have also featured alternate versions of the character. The Elseworlds imprint takes the company's iconic characters and places them in alternate timelines, places and events making heroes "as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow."[87] Barbara Gordon, as both Batgirl and Oracle, has made several appearances in Elseworlds comics since 1997. The character is given starring roles in the noir-style storyline Thrillkiller: Batgirl & Robin (1997),[88] its sequel Batgirl + Batman: Thrillkiller '62 (1998),[89] and the one-shot comic Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl (1998).[90] In addition, the character has supporting roles in JLA: The Nail (1998), JLA: Created Equal (2000),[91] Superman & Batman: Generations (2003),[92] Batman: Year 100 (2006), and Batman: Earth One (2012). A version of her will appear as "Nightwing" in the Smallville comic series, replacing Stephanie Brown as previously promoted. [93]In 2005, DC Comics launched its All Star imprintan ongoing series of comics designed to pair the company's most iconic characters with the most acclaimed writers and artists in the industry. Similar to Elseworlds, All Star is not restricted to continuity and establishes a fresh perspective for the latest generation of readership. According to Dan DiDio, "[t]hese books are created to literally reach the widest audience possible, and not just the comic book audience, but anyone who has ever wanted to read or see anything about Superman or Batman."[94] An alternate Barbara Gordon was adapted into Frank Miller's All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder (2005) as a teenage Batgirl. In addition, another variation of the character had been set to star in an eponymous All Star Batgirl title, written by Geoff Johns; however, the series was canceled prior to publication.[95]"One could argue that curing Barbara and allowing her to be Batgirl again would simply allow her to do more good fighting crime than she ever could in a wheelchair, but then you look insensitive to the ability and usefulness she has in other capacities as Oracle. Conversely, you could say that removing Barbara from her wheelchair drastically alters her character, but then wouldn't that indicate that this is a character defined by her handicap? This begs the question [sic] of why so many fans adore her: is it because she's a bold and daring leader that rivals the Calculator in brains? Or is it because she's all of that, but stuck in a wheelchair? Think about the question, and surely many of you will find an answer you don't like."In the aftermath of Batman: The Killing Joke, Barbara Gordon's paralysis has been the subject of debate, with arguments in favor of, and against, restoring her mobility. Writers, artists, editorial staff and critics have spoken in great length about the nature of subject, citing responses from readership, issues of sexism, diversity and representation, as well as other considerations that have impacted decisions regarding the character's portrayal.Reacting to The Killing Joke and Barbara Gordon's later character development as Oracle in Batman: Gotham Knights, Ray Tate, a reviewer at Comics Bulletin, wrote "[t]here is absolutely no reason why Barbara Gordon should be in a wheelchair. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland meant The Killing Joke as an imaginary tale dealing with the iconography of Batman and the Joker... [Batman] himself is a certifiable genius in biochemistry. There are countless examples of Batman employing that which is only theoretical in his fight against crime. His knowledge of stem cell technology should surpass that of the real world. There is simply no reason for Barbara Gordon to be confined to that wheelchair."[97] Regarding her representation as a character living with a disability, and her effectiveness as a hero compared to her incarnation as Batgirl, Tate asserts "[i]t's ridiculous to think somebody wakes up thinking how lucky they are to be confined to a wheelchair, and yet the attitude around DC and among the fans is that Oracle is the better character over Batgirl because of her handicap. Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman's life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl."[97] Shannon Cochran in an article for Bitch magazine entitled "The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence" noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes. She quotes Gail Simone, who discussed the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis: "Both had their backs broken [Batman broke his in a dramatic Batcave confrontation with the villain Bane; Batgirl broke hers when she was ambushed in her home and shot in the spine by the Joker, never given a chance to fight]. Less than a year later, Batman was fine. Batgirlnow named Oraclewas in a wheelchair and remained so for many years.[25] Artist Alex Ross and writer/producer Paul Dini have made attempts to return the character to her original conception. Ross explained in an interview that he and Dini had planned to restore her mobility by placing her in a Lazarus Pit, a naturally occurring chemical pool in the DC universe that has rejuvenating effects when a person is submerged within it. He stated that "we pitched then-Batman editor Denny O'Neil with these drawings of that costume design. The idea of using the red instead of the traditional yellow was meant to invoke the idea that coming from the Lazarus Pit, she was in a way, more compromised as a character... Denny shot it down, because, according to him, everybody loves Barbara Gordon as Oracle and as a handicapped character. The theory was that DC didn't have enough handicapped characters, so they weren't going to do anything with Barbara as she was. And the design went into the drawer."[98] Kate Kane, the modern Batwoman introduced during 52, wears a variation of what would have been Gordon's new Batgirl costume designed by Ross.[99]"Without much fanfare, Barbara Gordon has become the most popular handicapped character since Charles Xavier... There WAS some idea of her being a role model... We wanted her to cope with what had happened to her and becoming, in many ways, more effective as Oracle than she ever was as Batgirl. And we knew that others with disabilities might look at her and feel good reading about her... I don't think people 'dance around' her disabilities as they don't want to focus on them, but on her character. These shouldn't be stories about a disabled person; they are stories about a compelling fascinating character who HAPPENS to be in a wheelchair and I think that's correct. Barbara isn't her handicap; there's more to her than that."Although critical reception of Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle have been mixed among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: "We have, over the years, on those occasions when I have worked with the character, gotten some letters from those who have disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive. I feel very proud for my part in creating Oracle."[100] Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless of the events that caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon is not limited to the Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, "Some stories... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without [former Flash Barry Allen]'s sacrifice, or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker."[101] The character went through possible restoration during Birds of Prey when she is infected with microscopic machines known as nanites by the super villain Brainiac, which attempted to repair her DNA. Marc Dipaolo, author of War, Politics and Superheroes: Ethics and Propaganda in Comics and Film (2011) commented that DC writers and editors would not allow her to recover completely, and that "[t]he decision was made because there were not enough handicapped superheroes in the DC Universe to justify 'curing' one, and because it would have been odd to see Barbara Gordon escape from her wheelchair in the world of fiction when [Christopher Reeve] never had that opportunity."[102]In June 2011, DC announced that Barbara Gordon would be returning to the role of Batgirl in September 2011, in her own eponymous monthly comic, as part of a company-wide relaunch of all of their titles. In addition, former Birds of Prey writer Gail Simone would be writing the series.[70] This announcement became one of the most controversial aspects of the DC Comics relaunch.[103] Supporters of Barbara Gordon in her persona as Oracle have expressed dismay over losing an iconic character for the disabled community. Journalist and blogger Jill Pantozzi, who is diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, stated that "people being disabled is part of the real world, it is essential it be part of the fictional world as well... Writer Kevin Van Hook did a great job showing what disabled individuals have to go through in the mini-series Oracle: The Cure. Its that type of honesty I expect more of... While some diverse characters were mishandled over the years, Oracle was always treated with the utmost respect but this move is the most disrespectful Ive seen in a long time."[66] Gail Simone responded directly by stating that at times when others had attempted to restore Gordon's mobility, she fought to keep her as a disabled character, even in light of requests from readers who also had disabilities that wished to see the character healed.[104] However, part of her reasoning for reversing her decision and writing Batgirl with Gordon as the title character was that "[a]rms and legs get ripped off, and they grow back, somehow. Graves don't stay filled. But the one constant is that Barbara stays in that chair. Role model or not, that is problematic and uncomfortable, and the excuses to not cure her, in a world of purple rays and magic and super-science, are often unconvincing or wholly meta-textual. And the longer it goes on, the more it has stretched credibility. But now, everything has changed. If nearly everyone in the DCU, not just Batgirl but almost everyone, is now at a much earlier stage in their career, then my main objection no longer applies, because we are seeing Barbara at an earlier starting point."[104] Former Batman writer and editor Dennis O'Neil and Oracle co-creator John Ostrander have expressed disappointment over the change. O'Neil stated that during his tenure at DC, "[W]e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals... We didn't have anybody like Oracle, who overcame a disability and was just as valuable and just as effective in a way that didn't involve violence."[105] However, he also stated that from an alternate point of view, "Barbara Gordon's perception in the mainstream public as Batgirl would be a very valid consideration."[105] Ostrander continues to view Oracle as a stronger character than Batgirl, but has also expressed faith in Gail Simone's skills as a writer. He commented that "[t]imes change and characters and people evolve. I changed things when I wrote characters, including changing Barbara to Oracle. Others do the same for this era... Gail Simone is a good friend and a wonderful writer and I'm sure her work will be wonderful."[105]At the time of her conception, Barbara Gordon's character was intended to reflect the women's liberation movement as an educated, career-oriented young woman, as well as a capable crime-fighter. Batgirl is considered to be one of the most popular character to have emerged during the Silver Age of Comic Books.[8] In The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines (2009), author Mike Madrid states: "While she embodied the spirit of a new wave of liberated superheroines, in the backdrop of the history of comic books, Batgirl carried on the tradition of the gutsy female vigilantes of the '40s who struck out on their own to right wrongs."[7] Although she is discouraged by Batman to engage in crime-fighting, she defiantly ignores his objections.[106] Her career choice as a librarian is speculated to be due in part to the fact that it works as a convincing cover for her much more dangerous work as Batgirl. In an effort to conceal her identity from not only her enemies, but her father, Commissioner Gordon, Batman and Robin, she initially conforms to appearance and personality traits stereotypical of a librarian. In her civilian identity, she is seen with her hair "tied up tightly in a bun. And she's wearing traditional conservativenot to say dowdyclothing. In other words, she embodies the stereotypical image of the female librarian of the day-busy doing clerical tasks while attired and made up in such a way as to guarantee to minimize whatever physical attractiveness she might possess beneath her frumpy exterior."[8] Although her introduction was intended to embody feminist ideology, aspects of her persona were also considered to be sexist, such as the fact that "[m]uch of her arsenal was carried in a batpurse attached to her utility belt[.]"[106]In spite of shortcomings in her characterization during the late 1960s, "by the early 1970s, Batgirl had matured, using her keen intellect, athletic dexterity, and burgeoning detective skills to solve petty and not-so-petty thefts."[106] However, by the end of the Bronze Age of Comic Books in the mid-1980s (and with the dark, gritty influence of Frank Miller's work on the Batman related titles), Batgirl became less valuable to the franchise "where there was not as much room for a librarian fighting crime in high heels."[26] As such, Barbara Gordon becomes increasingly skeptical of her effectiveness as Batgirl until she decides to give up crime-fighting permanently.[106]Robin Anne Reid, in her 2008 book, Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews notes a lack of characterization given to Barbara Gordon by Alan Moore in Batman: The Killing Joke, stating, "Barbara Gordon was not portrayed as the intelligent and resourceful woman who assumed the Batgirl persona; she was portrayed as a coco-serving homemaker overly concerned with the mess her father was making cutting and pasting news clippings."[107] Following the character's recreation as Oracle, she is shown having overcome her paralysis at the hands of the Joker by utilizing her intellect to once again engage in crime-fighting as an information broker. Speaking on her characterization as a person living with a disability, comic writer Devin Grayson stated that being "[h]yper-defensive about her [paralysis], she has, if anything, over compensated. However, her very determination to remain self-reliant, though admirable and inspiring, has made her less willing than ever to accept support or aid of any kind."[108] One defining characteristic is her sense of morality, which differs from that of Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. Oracle has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's Birds of Prey issue No. 10, "State of War", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated an interview that "[s]he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She's not comfortable with that but accepts it. She would do anything to avoid using deadly force but, when push comes to shove, she'll drop the hammer."[109] She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information, which denies criminals the right of due process.[110] Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force, she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology.[111]As part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch, The New 52, Barbara Gordon's paralysis is described as lasting only three years time. In Batgirl (volume 4), the character's age is reduced, and she is depicted as a recent college graduate, having earned a degree in forensic psychology.[112] Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, causing her to hesitate in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage.[71] The character also exhibits survivor guilt due to the fact she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not.[71] In a September 2011 interview, Gail Simone stated, "I'm enjoying writing Batgirl at this stage in her life. She's younger, she doesn't know everything, she's been immersed in school and her life-plan. Events conspire to change that plan, and she's nervous about that. I love writing Barbara under pretty much any conditions, but this really is a key time for her."[113]According to the character's fictional biography, Barbara Gordon took numerous self-defense classes in judo and karate, earning brown belts, prior to her tenure as Batgirl and is described as being a "star athlete."[22] Although not as proficient as other prominent DC characters such as Black Canary or the Huntress, she's still considered a very skilled martial artist and an outstanding acrobat, having been further trained by Batman himself. Following the events of The Killing Joke, Barbara Gordon continued to train in the martial arts as Oracle, despite being paralyzed from the waist down. She has extensive skills with eskrima fighting sticks, small firearms, and batarangs; she customarily keeps a pair of eskrima sticks stored in the armrests of her wheelchair as a contingency.Gordon is written as having a genius-level intellect and naturally possessing a photographic memory.[114] She is described by Gail Simone as the most intelligent member of the Batman family and among all characters having operated out of Gotham City.[115] Prior to the character's career as a vigilante, Barbara Gordon developed many technological skills, including vast knowledge of computers and electronics, expert skills as a hacker, and graduate training in library sciences. Like Batman, Barbara Gordon originally used a wide variety of computer electronics and gadgets during her early adventures as Batgirl. These included an infrared scanner built into the cowl of her costume, various bat-inspired weaponry, and the Batcycle. According to Gail Simone, Oracle maintains control over the twelve technologically advanced satellites that were created by Lex Luthor during his tenure as President of the United States.[116]As Oracle, Barbara Gordon placed her considerable skills and knowledge at the disposal of many of the DC Universe's heroes.[114] She is a skilled hacker, capable of retrieving and dispersing information from private satellites, military installations, government files, and the properties of Lex Luthor.[111] Batman, himself a genius with a wide knowledge base and access to vast information resources, routinely consults Oracle for assistance. Writer and editor Dennis O'Neil, who first established Oracle as Batman's intellectual equal and source of information, stated that "[i]t was logical for her to be there in Batman's world... Batman would need someone like that."[105]Since her debut in DC Comics publication, and fueled by her adaptation into the Batman television series in 1967, Barbara Gordon has been listed among fictional characters that are regarded as cultural icons.[117] Author Brian Cronin, in Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed (2009) notes that following her 1967 debut, "Batgirl was soon popular enough to appear regularly over the next two decades and Yvonne Craig certainly made an impression on many viewers with her one season portraying young Ms. Gordon."[26] Similarly, Cronin states that following the publication of The Killing Joke, Barbara Gordonin her new persona as Oraclebecame "more popular, in fact, than she was when she was Batgirl. She even gained her own title, Birds of Prey, about her and a group of superhero operatives she organizes[.]"[26] The character has been the subject of analysis in academia, regarding the portrayal of women, librarians, and those living with disabilities in mainstream media. Throughout the course of the character's history, Barbara Gordon's intelligence has been one of her defining attributes. According to BusinessWeek, she is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional superheroes appearing in American comics, and is the only female character to appear on the list.[118] In 2011, IGN ranked Barbara Gordon 17th in the Top 100 Comic Books Heroes.[3]In The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines (2009), author Mike Madrid states that what set Barbara Gordon as Batgirl apart from other female characters was her motivation for crime-fighting. Unlike Batwoman who preceded her, "she wears his symbol on her chest, but she is not his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden."[7] Because of the fact she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman, "Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime, the same way he would a male."[7] Historian Peter Sanderson observed that while "Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian... her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect as a symbol of the emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s. (Moreover, by the 1970s Barbara had given herself a makeover even in her 'civilian identity' and ran for Congress.)"[119]In the 1980s, Barbara Kesel, after writing a complaint to DC Comics over the negative portrayal of female characters, was given the opportunity to write for Barbara Gordon in Detective Comics. Robin Anne Reid, in Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews (2009) wrote that "Kesel's version of Batgirl established her as a character separate from Batman and Robin: a woman motivated to do what men do, but alone and in her own way. Her Secret Origins (1987) and Batgirl Special (1988) countered the victimized and objectified presentation of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl in Alan Moore's acclaimed The Killing Joke (1988)."[107] She notes that Kesel's interpretation of the character emphasized her intelligence, technological skill, and ability to overcome fear. Commenting on Barbara Gordon's eventual evolution into Oracle, she states "[m]any readers and individuals within the industry believe that Barbara Gordon became a 'better' character after she was paralyzed, but few people comment on specifics of the event that allowed her to become that 'better' character."[107]In Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks (2010), author Sharon Packer wrote that "[a]nyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [Gordon's] accident is advised to consult the source material" calling the work "sadistic to the core."[120] Brian Cronin noted that "[many] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much, and even Moore, in retrospect, has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out."[26] Jeffrey A. Brown, author of Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture (2011) noted The Killing Joke as an example of the "inherent misogyny of the male-dominated comic book industry" in light of the "relatively unequal violence [female characters] are subjected to."[27] While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage.[27] Reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the idea she had become outdated, "if audiences had grown tired of Batgirl, it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly."[107]Despite views that present the character's Batgirl persona as a symbol of female empowerment, a long-held criticism is that she was originally conceived as an uninspired variation of Batman "rather than standing alone as leader, such as Wonder Woman" who had no pre-existing male counterpart.[121] In analyzing stereotypes in gender, Jackie Marsh noted that male superheroes (such as Batman) are depicted as hyper-masculine and anti-social, "while female superheroes are reduced to a childlike status by their names" such as the Batgirl character.[122] Professor James B. South, chairman of the Department of Philosophy at Marquette University, stated that Barbara Gordon's character development as Oracle gave her a sense of independence she could not achieve as Batgirl. During her tenure as Batman's protege, "she seems to develop her own style of fighting as Batgirl, [but] she's still basically following in Batman's footsteps."[105] Following The Killing Joke, her recreation as Oracle, and the launch of Birds of Prey, "we see Barbara Gordon as a team leader and her transformation from a girl into a woman."[105]In The Image and Role of the Librarian (2002), Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel argue that her portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession, in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career. Even in light of the fact that the character abandons it in order to run for United States Congress, Barbara Gordon is seen as being given a "career switch that even most librarians would consider a step up."[8] In the essay "Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality" (2007), Abigail Luthmann views the character less favorably, stating that "[t]he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low-visibility disguise for her crime-fighting alter-ego, and while her information-locating skills may have been useful to her extra-curricular activities no direct examples are given."[123] Unlike her earlier incarnation as Batgirl, "[a]s Oralce, Barbara Gordon is arguably the first true librarian-as-super-hero yet seen in a mainstream comic book (as opposed to a super-hero who happens to be a librarian in his/her private life)."[8] Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel note that Oracle exerts her influence over the DC Universe primarily from home, putting "to full use the information science skills [she] learned on her way to her PhD"[8] In her new persona, "the physically challenged but superbly resourceful Oracle occupies a unique place in the annals of superhero-domthe 'information goddess' as crime stopper."[8] Using Barbara Gordon in her role as Oracle, author Sean Wise asserts her character as a model for business networking. In How to Be a Business Superhero: Prepare for Everything, Train with the Best, Make Your Own Destiny at Work (2008) he states that "[o]ver the last decade, Oracle has shown the power of a strong network of contacts, and in doing so she shows Business Superheros the importance of cultivating contacts and developing assets that can further their collective goals."[124]Following the character's reinvention as the information broker Oracle, she has been regarded as a symbol of empowerment for those living with disabilities. In Unleashing the Superhero in Us All (2008), author T. James Musler notes that "[f]or quite sometime, any handicap was considered insurmountable" citing Franklin D. Roosevelt as an example, who was never photographed in a wheelchair to avoid a perception of weakness.[125] In reference to Barbara Gordon, he states "[r]ather than quitting crime fighting, Barbara combines her intellect and computer skills to help the superhero community by gathering and passing along information."[125] Her character thus signifies that "[n]o longer is a handicap overwhelming, a person can live a strong good life, handicap or not."[125] In The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic-Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes (2004), author Gina Rene Misiroglu observes that while disabled characters in comic book are typically utilized as gimmicks, oras with Charles Xavier and Daredevilare introduced with a pre-existing condition as part of their origin myth, "[a]s Oracle... Gordon stands tall as the most empowering disabled superhero. Readers witnessed her tragedy, and watched her rise above it."[108] James B. South's chapter "Barbara Gordon and Moral Perfectionism" in the 2004 book Superheroes and Philosophy analyzes how the changes in her life "from librarian to Batgirl to Oracle" drive her to pursue a higher self, illustrating the philosophical theory of moral perfectionism.[126]Portrayed by Yvonne Craig, the character's first adaptation outside of comic books took place in the third season of Batman (1967). Les Daniels, in Batman: The Complete History (2004) wrote that the goal of ABC was to "attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men."[4] According to Craig: "I used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice."[4] A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes in television at the time (such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen.[117] As such, "her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl through the use of a straight kick to her opponent's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use."[117] However, Craig has also stated: "I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model... They say its because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think thats lovely."[127] During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women.[121] Since Batman, the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media.[121] As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series, voiced by Jane Webb in The Batman/Superman Hour (1968), Melendy Britt in The New Adventures of Batman (1977), Melissa Gilbert in Batman: The Animated Series (1992), Tara Strong in The New Batman Adventures (1997), Danielle Judovits in The Batman (2004), Mae Whitman in Batman: The Brave and the Bold (2008)[121] and Alyson Stoner in Young Justice (2011). The Batman series also showcased the character's first animated adaptation as Oracle, voiced by Kellie Martin in the episode "Artifacts" (2007).Dina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the television series Birds of Prey (2002). It became the first adaptation to show the character's progression from Batgirl to Oracle, which included her paralysis at the hands of the Joker. Meyer commented on her character's complex history stating: "She's multidimensional. She was a former superhero. She was extremely active physically for years, fighting alongside Batman. The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use of her legs... but rather than give up and throw in the towel, as she could've done so easily, she went and studied escrima (a martial art), got stronger in her mental state and, while helping out her father on a case one day, realized she had a knack for solving mysteries. And all of a sudden she became this computer genius."[128] Overall, the series received criticism for its emphasis on aesthetics over plot.[129][130] It aired for one season before receiving cancellation.Other variations of the character that have been adapted into other media include the Barbara Wilson/Batgirl character portrayed by Alicia Silverstone in the feature film Batman & Robin (1997) and an elderly Barbara Gordon, voiced by Stockard Channing and Angie Harmon in 1999's Batman Beyond, who after retiring as Batgirl, became commissioner of Gotham City police.[121]In addition to live-action television and animation, the character has appeared in a number of video games included in the Batman franchise. She appears in The Adventures of Batman & Robin, Batman: Vengeance and Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu voiced by Tara Strong. She is also in Batman: Dark Tomorrow for the first time as Oracle.[131] She also appears in LEGO Batman for the PC, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PlayStation Portable.[132] She plays a supporting role as Oracle in Batman: Arkham Asylum for the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, serving as Batman's guide through Arkham, and is voiced by Kimberly Brooks. She also appears as the radio guide alongside Alfred Pennyworth, as they both serve as Batman's guides in the sequel, Batman: Arkham City. In an in-depth overview of the game's demo published in Game Informer, it is mentioned that a line of dialogue indicates that within the game, nobody has been able to contact Oracle as of late.[133] She also acts as the primary contact for hero characters as Oracle in DC Universe Online, voiced by Katherine Catmull for the PC and the PlayStation 3. She assists the player through the tutorial and will offer comments and advice throughout the game including a guided tour of the JLA Watchtower.Gardner FoxCarmine InfantinoBatman FamilyBirds of PreySeven Soldiers of VictorySuicide SquadJustice LeagueSkilled martial artist and detectiveGenius-level intellectPh.D. in library scienceDegree in forensic psychologySuperb computer hackerPhotographic memory1 Publication history

Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations. In accordance with these laws, more than sixty Internet regulations have been made by the People's Republic of China (PRC) government, implemented by provincial branches of state-owned ISPs, business companies, and organizations.[1][2] The apparatus of the PRC's Internet repression is considered more extensive and more advanced than in any other country in the world. The governmental authorities not only block website content but also monitor the Internet access of individuals.Amnesty International notes that China has the largest recorded number of imprisoned journalists and cyber-dissidents in the world. The offences of which they are accused include communicating with groups abroad, signing online petitions, and calling for reform and an end to corruption.[3] The escalation of the government's effort to neutralize critical online opinion comes after a series of large anti-Japanese, anti-pollution, anti-corruption protests, and ethnic riots, many of which were organized or publicized using instant messaging services, chat rooms, and text messages. The size of the Internet police is rumored at more than 30,000.[4]The political and ideological background of the Internet censorship is considered to be one of Deng Xiaoping's favorite sayings in the early 1980s: "If you open the window for fresh air, you have to expect some flies to blow in." The saying is related to a period of the economic reform of China that became known as the "socialist market economy". Superseding the political ideologies of the Cultural Revolution, the reform led China towards a market economy and opened up the market for foreign investors. Nonetheless the Communist Party of China has wished to protect its values and political ideas from "swatting flies" of other ideologies.[5]The Internet arrived in China in the year 1994 as an inevitable consequence of, and supporting tool for, the "socialist market economy." Since then, and with gradual increasing penetration, the Internet has become a common communication platform and an important tool for sharing information. In 1998 the Communist Party of China feared the China Democracy Party (CDP) would breed a powerful new network that the party elites might not be able to control.[6] The CDP was immediately banned followed by arrests and imprisonment.[7] That same year the "Golden Shield project" was started. The first part of the project lasted eight years and was completed in 2006. The second part began in 2006 and ended in 2008. On 6 December 2002, 300 people in charge of the Golden Shield project from 31 provinces and cities throughout China participated in a four-day inaugural Comprehensive Exhibition on Chinese Information System.[8] At the exhibition, many western high-tech products including Internet security, video monitoring and human face recognition were purchased. It is estimated that around 3050,000 police are employed in this gigantic project.[9]The government of the PRC defends its right to censor the internet by claiming that the country has the right to govern the internet according to its own rules inside its borders. The white paper, released in June 2010, called the internet a crystallization of human wisdom. But in the document the government lays out some of the reasons why its citizens cannot get access to all of that wisdom. It says it wants to curb the harmful effects of illegal information on state security, public interests and children. Laws and regulations clearly prohibit the spread of information that contains content subverting state power, undermining national unity [or] infringing upon national honor and interests, it says. Another section of the same white paper reaffirms the government's determination to govern the internet within its borders according to its own rules. "Within Chinese territory the internet is under the jurisdiction of Chinese sovereignty. The internet sovereignty of China should be respected and protected," it says. It adds that foreign individuals and firms can use the internet in China, but they must abide by the country's laws.[10]The central government of China started its Internet censorship with three regulations. The first regulation was called the Temporary Regulation for the Management of Computer Information Network International Connection. The regulation was passed in the 42nd Standing Convention of the State Council on 23 January 1996. It was formally announced on 1 February 1996, and updated again on the 20th of May 1997.[11] The content of the first regulation states requires that Internet service providers be licensed and that Internet traffic go through ChinaNet, GBNet, CERNET or CSTNET. The second regulation was the Ordinance for Security Protection of Computer Information Systems. It was issued on 18 February 1994 by the State Council to give the responsibility of Internet security protection to the Ministry of Public Security.[12]The Ordinance regulation further led to the Security Management Procedures in Internet Accessing issued by the Ministry of Public Security in December 1997. The regulation defines "harmful information" and "harmful activities" regarding internet usage.[13] Section Five of the Computer Information Network and Internet Security, Protection, and Management Regulations approved by the State Council on 11 December 1997 states the following:No unit or individual may use the Internet to create, replicate, retrieve, or transmit the following kinds of information:In September 2000, State Council Order No. 292 created the first content restrictions for internet content providers. China-based Web sites cannot link to overseas news Web sites or distribute news from overseas media without separate approval. Only licensed print publishers have the authority to deliver news online. Non-licensed Web sites that wish to broadcast news may only publish information already released publicly by other news media. These sites must obtain approval from state information offices and from the State Council Information Agency. Article 11 of this order mentions that content providers are responsible for ensuring the legality of any information disseminated through their services.[15] Article 14 gives government officials full access to any kind of sensitive information they wish from providers of internet services.In December 1997, Public Security minister Zhu Entao released new regulations to be enforced by the ministry that inflict fines for "defaming government agencies," "splitting the nation," and leaking "state secrets." Violators could face a fine up to 15,000 Yuan ($1800).[16] Banning appears mostly coordinated and ad hoc, with some sites blocked, yet similar sites allowed or even blocked in one city and allowed in another. The blocks have often been lifted for special occasions. For example, The New York Times was unblocked when reporters in a private interview with Jiang Zemin specifically asked about the block and he replied that he would look into the matter. During the APEC summit in Shanghai during 2001, normally blocked media sources such as CNN, NBC, and the Washington Post became accessible. Since 2001, the content controls have been further relaxed on a permanent basis, and all three of the sites previously mentioned are now accessible from mainland China. However, access to the New York Times was briefly re-blocked as of 20 December 2008,[17] although it has been accessible for the first months of 2009 as of 17 May.In the summer of 2005, the PRC purchased over 200 routers from an American company, Cisco Systems, that allowed the PRC government a more advanced technological censoring ability.[18][19] In February 2006, Google made a significant concession to the Great Firewall of China, in exchange for equipment installation on Chinese soil, by blocking websites which the Chinese government deemed illegal.[20]In May 2011 the State Council Information Office announced transfer of its offices which regulated the Internet to a new subordinate agency, the State Internet Information Office which would be responsible for regulating the Internet in the People's Republic of China. The relationship of the new agency to other agencies in the PRC which regulate the Internet was unclear from the announcement.[21]Internet censorship in the PRC has been called "a panopticon that encourages self-censorship through the perception that users are being watched."[22] The enforcement (or threat of enforcement) of censorship creates a chilling effect where individuals and businesses willingly censor their own communications to avoid legal and economic repercussions. ISPs and other service providers are legally liable for customers' conduct. The service providers have assumed an editorial role with regard to customer content, thus became publishers, and legally responsible for libel and other torts committed by customers. Some hotels in China advise Internet users to obey local Chinese Internet access rules by leaving a list of Internet rules and guidelines near the computers. These rules, among other things, forbid linking to politically unacceptable messages, and inform Internet users that if they do, they will have to face legal consequences.[23]On 16 March 2002, the Internet Society of China, a self-governing Chinese Internet industry body,[24] launched the Public Pledge on Self-Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry, an agreement between the Chinese Internet industry regulator and companies that operate sites in China. In signing the agreement, web companies pledge to identify and prevent the transmission of information that Chinese authorities deem objectionable, including information that breaks laws or spreads superstition or obscenity, or that may jeopardize state security and disrupt social stability.[25][26][27] As of 2006, the pledge had been signed by more than 3,000 entities operating websites in China.[28]Although the government does not have the physical resources to monitor all Internet chat rooms and forums, the threat of being shut down has caused Internet content providers to employ internal staff, colloquially known as "big mamas", who stop and remove forum comments which may be politically sensitive. In Shenzhen, these duties are partly taken over by a pair of police-created cartoon characters, Jingjing and Chacha, who help extend the online "police presence" of the Shenzhen authorities. These cartoons spread across the nation in 2007 reminding Internet users that they are being watched and should avoid posting "sensitive" or "harmful" material on the Internet.[16]However, Internet content providers have adopted some counter-strategies. One is to post politically sensitive stories and remove them only when the government complains. In the hours or days in which the story is available online, people read it, and by the time the story is taken down, the information is already public. One notable case in which this occurred was in response to a school explosion in 2001, when local officials tried to suppress the fact the explosion resulted from children illegally producing fireworks.[29]On 11 July 2003, the PRC government started granting licenses to businesses to open Internet cafe chains. Business analysts and foreign Internet operators regard the licenses as intended to clamp down on information deemed harmful to the PRC government. In July 2007, the city of Xiamen announced it would ban anonymous online postings after text messages and online communications were used to rally protests against a proposed chemical plant in the city. Internet users will be required to provide proof of identity when posting messages on the more than 100,000 Web sites registered in Xiamen.[30]Fines and short arrests are becoming an optional punishment to whoever expresses undesirable information through the different Internet formats, as this is seen as a risk to social stability.[31]In 2001, Wang Xiaoning and other Chinese activists were arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison for using a Yahoo email account to post anonymous writing to an Internet mailing list.[32] On 23 July 2008, the family of Liu Shaokun was notified that he had been sentenced to one year re-education through labor for inciting a disturbance. As a teacher in Sichuan province, he had taken photographs of collapsed schools and posted these photos online.[33] On 18 July 2008, Huang Qi was formally arrested on suspicion of illegally possessing state secrets. Huang had spoken with the foreign press and posted information on his website about the plight of parents who had lost children in collapsed schools.[34] Shi Tao, a Chinese journalist, used his Yahoo! email account to send a message to a U.S.-based pro-democracy website. In his email, he summarized a government order directing media organizations in China to downplay the upcoming 15th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy activists. Police arrested him in November 2004, charging him with "illegally providing state secrets to foreign entities." In April 2005, he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and two years subsequent deprivation of his political rights.[35]The system blocks content by preventing IP addresses from being routed through. It consists of standard firewalls and proxy servers at the Internet gateways. The system also selectively engages in DNS poisoning when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical.[36] Researchers at the University of California, Davis and at the University of New Mexico said that the censorship system is not a true firewall since banned material is sometimes able to pass through several routers or through the entire system without being blocked.[22] Details for some commonly used technical methods for censoring are:[37]Other reported methods have included:The Golden Shield Project is owned by the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China (MPS). It started in 1998, began processing in November 2003, and the first part of the project passed the national inspection on 16 November 2006 in Beijing. According to MPS, its purpose is to construct a communication network and computer information system for police to improve their capability and efficiency. By 2002 the preliminary work of the Golden Shield Project had cost US$800 million (equivalent to RMB 5,000 million or 620 million).[42] Greg Walton, a free lance researcher, said that the aim of the Golden Shield is to establish a "gigantic online database" that would include "speech and face recognition, closed-circuit television... [and] credit records" as well as traditional Internet use records.[43]A notice[44] issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on 19 May stated that, as of 1 July 2009, manufacturers must ship machines to be sold in mainland China with the Green Dam Youth Escort software.[45] On 14 August 2009, Li Yizhong, minister of industry and information technology, announced that computer manufacturers and retailers were no longer obliged to ship the software with new computers for home or business use, but that schools, Internet cafes and other public use computers would still be required to run the software.A senior official of the Internet Affairs Bureau of the State Council Information Office said the software's only purpose was "to filter pornography on the Internet". The general manager of Jinhui, which developed Green Dam, said: "Our software is simply not capable of spying on Internet users, it is only a filter."[46] Human rights advocates in China have criticized the software for being "a thinly concealed attempt by the government to expand censorship".[47] Online polls conducted on Sina, Netease, Tencent, Sohu, and Southern Metropolis Daily revealed over 70% rejection of the software by netizens.[48][49] However, Xinhua commented that "support [for Green Dam] largely stems from end users, opposing opinions primarily come from a minority of media outlets and businesses".[50][51]According to a Harvard study, at least 18,000 websites are blocked from within mainland China.[52] Out of the Top 100 Global Websites, 12 are currently blocked in mainland China.[53] According to the PRC-sponsored news agency, Xinhua, stated that censorship targets only "superstitious, pornographic, violence-related, gambling and other harmful information."[54] On the other hand, websites centered on the following political topics are often censored: Falun Gong,[55] police brutality, Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, freedom of speech, democracy,[56] Taiwan independence,[55] Tibetan independence movement,[55] and the Tuidang movement.[57] Foreign media websites such as BBC News, Yahoo! Hong Kong and the Voice of America are occasionally blocked.A lot of larger Japanese websites were blocked during the afternoon of 15 June 2012 (UTC+08:00) to the morning of 17 June 2012 (UTC+08:00), such as Google Japan, Yahoo! Japan, Amazon Japan, Excite, Yomiuri News, Sponichi News and Nikkei BP Japan.A 2012 study of social media sites by other Harvard researchers found that 13% of internet posts were blocked, focusing mainly on any form of collective action (anything from false rumors driving riots to protest organizers to large parties for fun), pornography, and criticism of the censors; significant criticisms of the government were allowed.[58]One part of the block is to filter the search results of certain terms on Chinese search engines. These Chinese search engines include both international ones (for example, yahoo.com.cn and Google China) as well as domestic ones (for example, Baidu). Attempting to search for censored keywords in these Chinese search engines will yield few or no results. Previously, google.cn displayed the following at the bottom of the page: "According to the local laws, regulations and policies, part of the searching result is not shown." As was the case when searching for information about the 2011 uprising in Egypt.[59] When Google did business in the country, it set up computer systems inside China that try to access Web sites outside the country. If a site is inaccessible, then it is added to Google China's blacklist.[60]In addition, a connection containing intensive censored terms may also be closed by The Great Firewall, and cannot be reestablished for several minutes. This affects all network connections including HTTP and POP, but the reset is more likely to occur during searching. Before the search engines censored themselves, many search engines had been blocked, namely Google and AltaVista. Technorati, a search engine for blogs, has been blocked.[61] Different search engines implement the mandated censorship in different ways. For example, the search engine Bing is reported to censor search results from searches conducted in simplified Chinese characters (used in the PRC), but not in traditional Chinese characters (used in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau).[62]Several Bulletin Board Systems in universities were closed down or restricted public access since 2004, including the SMTH BBS and the YTHT BBS.[63]In September 2007, some data centers were shut down indiscriminately for providing interactive features such as blogs and forums. CBS reports an estimate that half the interactive sites hosted in China were blocked.[64]Coinciding with the twentieth anniversary of the government suppression of the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square, the government ordered Internet portals, forums and discussion groups to shut down their servers for maintenance between 3 and 6 June.[65] The day before the mass shut-down, Chinese users of Twitter, Hotmail and Flickr, among others, reported a widespread inability to access these services.[66]Although the government and media often use microblogging service Sina Weibo to spread ideas and monitor corruption, it is also supervised and self-censored by 700 Sina censors.[67] After the 2011 Wenzhou train collision, the government started emphasizing the danger in spreading 'false rumors' (yaoyan), making the permissive usage of Weibo and social networks a public debate.[68]In the second half of 2009 the social networking sites Facebook and Twitter were blocked, presumably because of containing social or political commentary (similar to LiveJournal in the above list). An example is the commentary on the July 2009 rmqi riots.[69][70] Another reason suggested for the block is that activists can utilize them to organize themselves.[71][72] In 2010 Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo became a forbidden topic in Chinese media due to his winning the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.[73]In 2012, First Monday published an article on "political content censorship in social media, i.e., the active deletion of messages published by individuals."[74] This academic study, which received extensive media coverage,[75][76] accumulated a dataset of 56 million messages sent on Sina Weibo from June through September 2011, and statistically analyzed them three months later, finding 212,583 deletions out of 1.3 million sampled, more than 16 percent. The study revealed that censors quickly deleted words with politically controversial meanings (e.g., qingci  "asking someone to resign" referring to calls for Railway Minister Sheng Guangzu to resign after the Wenzhou train collision on July 23, 2011), and also that the rate of message deletion was regionally anomalous (compare censorship rates of 53% in Tibet and 52% in Qinghai with 12% in Beijing and 11.4% in Shanghai).Foreign content providers such as Yahoo!, AOL, and Skype must abide by PRC government wishes, including having internal content monitors, in order to be able to operate within mainland China. Also, in accordance with mainland Chinese laws, Microsoft began to censor the content of its blog service Windows Live Spaces, arguing that continuing to provide Internet services is more beneficial to the Chinese.[77] Michael Anti is a famous Chinese journalist whose blog on Windows Live Spaces was censored by Microsoft. In an April 2006 e-mail panel discussion Rebecca MacKinnon, who reported from China for nine years as a Beijing bureau chief for CNN, said: "... many bloggers said he [Anti] was a necessary sacrifice so that the majority of Chinese can continue to have an online space to express themselves as they choose. So the point is, compromises are being made at every level of society because nobody has the expectation of political freedom anyway."[78]The Chinese version of MySpace, launched in April 2007, has many censorship-related differences from other international versions of the service. Discussion forums on topics such as religion and politics are absent and a filtering system that prevents the posting of content about politically sensitive topics has been added.[79] Users are also given the ability to report the "misconduct" of other users for offenses including "endangering national security, leaking state secrets, subverting the government, undermining national unity, spreading rumors or disturbing the social order."[80]Some media have suggested that China's Internet censorship of foreign websites may also be a means of forcing mainland Chinese users to rely on China's own e-commerce industry, thus self-insulating their economy from the dominance of international corporations.[81] On 7 November 2005 an alliance of investors and researchers representing 26 companies in the U.S., Europe and Australia with over US $21 billion in joint assets announced that they were urging businesses to protect freedom of expression and pledged to monitor technology companies that do business in countries violating human rights, such as China. On 21 December 2005 the UN, OSCE and OAS special mandates on freedom of expression called on Internet corporations to "work together ... to resist official attempts to control or restrict use of the Internet." Google finally responded when attacked by hackers rumoured to be hired by the Chinese government by threatening to pull out of China (Newsweek)Reporters Without Borders suspects that regimes such as Cuba, Zimbabwe and Belarus have obtained surveillance technology from the People's Republic of China.[82]Internet censorship in China is circumvented by determined parties by using proxy servers outside the firewall.[83] VPN and SSH connections to outside mainland China are not blocked, so users may circumvent all of the censorship and monitoring of the Great Firewall if they have a secure connection method to a computer outside mainland China. However, disruptions of VPN services have been reported.[84] Rupert Murdoch famously proclaimed that advances in communications technology posed an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere[85] and Ai Weiwei argued that the Chinese leaders must understand it's not possible for them to control the Internet unless they shut it off".[86]As the Great Firewall of China gets more sophisticated, the users are getting increasingly creative in the ways they elude the censorship such as by using analogies to discuss topics. Furthermore, users are becoming increasingly open in their mockery of them by actively using homophones to avoid censorship. Deleted sites have "been harmonized", indicating President Hu Jintao's Internet censorship under the big picture of creating a "Socialist Harmonious Society". For example, censors are referred to as "river crabs", because in Chinese those two words together form a homophone for "harmony".[87] Since free hosting blog services like Blogger and Wordpress.com frequently face blockage,[88][89][90][91] some China-focused services explicitly offer to change a blog's IP address within 30 minutes if it is blocked by the authorities.[92] In July 2006, researchers at Cambridge University claim to have defeated the firewall by ignoring the TCP reset packets.[93]The Tor anonymity network was and is subject to blocking by China's Great Firewall.[94][95][96][97] The Tor website is blocked when accessed over HTTP but it is reachable over HTTPS so it is possible for users to download the Tor Browser Bundle.[98] The Tor network maintains a public list of approximately 3000 relays which are almost all blocked.[98] In addition to the public relays, Tor maintains so called bridges which are non-public relays.[99] Their purpose is to help censored users reach the Tor network. The Great Firewall is dynamically blocking these bridges by looking for their TLS fingerprint.[98][100] According to a research paper published in April 2012, the block can be circumvented by using packet fragmentation or the Tor obfsproxy bundle in combination with private obfsproxy bridges.[98][101]It was common in the past to use Google's cache feature to view blocked websites. However, this feature of Google seems to be under some level of blocking, as access is now erratic and does not work for blocked websites. Currently the block is mostly circumvented by using proxy servers outside the firewall, and is not difficult to carry out for those determined to do so. Some well-known proxy servers have also been blocked. Some Chinese citizens used the Google mirror elgooG after China blocked Google.[102]Moreover, net surfers come up with many more technical ways to get around with the Great Wall of China. Haystack is "a free proxy-like system that hides the user's traffic inside a continuous stream of innocent-looking requests. It also uses encryption, so people can get at any site without drawing attention to themselves". Steganography is a "practice of embedding useful data in what looks like something irrelevant. The text of a document can be broken into its constituent bytes, which are added to the pixels of an apparently innocent picture. The effect is barely visible on the picture, but the recipient can extract it with the right software".[103]BooksFilmsInternetMusicPressRadioThoughtSpeech and expressionVideo gamesBleepingBook burningBroadcast delayBurying of scholarsChilling effectInternet policeCensor barsConcisionConspiracy of silenceContent-control softwareEuphemism (Minced oath)ExpurgationFoggingGag orderHecklingInternet censorship circumventionMemory holeNational intranetNewspaper theftPixelizationPolitical correctnessPostalPrior restraintPropaganda modelPurgeRevisionismSanitization/RedactionSelf-censorshipSpeech codeStrategic lawsuitVerbal offenceWhitewashingWord filteringBlasphemyCriminalCorporateHate speechIdeologicalMedia biasMoralistic fallacyNaturalistic fallacyPoliticalReligiousSuppression of dissentSystemic biasCensorshipFreedom of speechInternet censorshipvteAccess Censorship DemocracyDigital divide Digital rightsFreedom of informationHistory Internet phenomenonNetwork neutralityPioneers PrivacySociology Usage

Brian Patrick Carroll (born May 13, 1969), better known by his stage name Buckethead, is a virtuoso guitarist and multi instrumentalist who has worked within several genres of music. He has released 40 studio albums, four special releases and one EP. He has performed on over 50 more albums by other artists. His music spans such diverse areas as progressive metal, funk, blues, jazz, bluegrass, ambient, and avant-garde music.Buckethead is famous for wearing a KFC bucket on his head, emblazoned with an orange bumper sticker reading FUNERAL in capital black block letters, and an expressionless plain white mask which, according to Buckethead, was inspired by his seeing Halloween 4.[1] Recently, he changed to a plain white bucket that no longer bore the KFC logo; but subsequently reverted to his trademark KFC bucket. He also incorporates nunchaku and robot dancing into his stage performances.[2][3][4]An instrumentalist, Buckethead has received critical acclaim for his electric guitar playing, and is considered one of the greatest guitarists of all time.[5] He has been voted number 8 on a list in GuitarOne magazine of the "Top 10 Greatest Guitar Shredders of All Time"[6] as well as being included in Guitar World's lists of the "25 all-time weirdest guitarists"[7] and is also known for being in the "50 fastest guitarists of all time list".[8]Buckethead performs primarily as a solo artist. He has collaborated extensively with a wide variety of high profile artists such as Bill Laswell, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, Iggy Pop, Les Claypool, Serj Tankian, Bill Moseley, Mike Patton, Viggo Mortensen, That 1 Guy, and was a member of Guns N' Roses from 2000 to 2004. Buckethead has also written and performed music for major motion pictures, including: Saw II, Ghosts of Mars, Beverly Hills Ninja, Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Last Action Hero, and contributed lead guitar to the track "Firebird" featured on the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie soundtrack.Buckethead began playing guitar at the age of twelve. He had been quoted as saying, however, that he did not become serious until a year later when he moved from Huntington Beach, CA to Claremont, CA. His playing began improving by taking private lessons from various teachers at a local music store, Styles Music. His early teachers included Max McGuire, Johnny Fortune, Mark Hammond, Pebber Brown and Paul Gilbert. Buckethead played a tribute to all his early teachers when the Deli Creeps played a show at Styles Music's 25th anniversary. Buckethead then later began making demo recordings of both his playing as well as his writing styles, which would be released as acoustic albums in the future.In 1988 after leaving the band Class-X, Carroll entered a song called "Brazos" into a Guitar Player magazine contest. It was a runner-up, with editors raving:An astonishingly skilled guitarist and bassist, he demonstrates post-Paul Gilbert speed and accuracy filtered through very kinky harmonic sensibilities. His psychotronic, demonic edge is very, very far removed from the clichs of classical metal and rock. A real talent to watch, also known as "Buckethead."[9]In the same year, the magazine's editor, Jas Obrecht, came to know of Buckethead when Brian and his parents left a demo recording at the magazine's reception desk for Obrecht. Impressed with this demo, he rushed into the restaurant where Buckethead and his parents were having lunch and encouraged him to make the most of his talent.[10] They soon became friends. In 1989 a song called "Soowee" by Buckethead got honorable mention in another song contest. In 1991, Buckethead moved into Obrecht's basement (this is also where the "Buckethead in the Basement" footage for the Young Buckethead DVD was filmed). The song "Brazos" was eventually released on the 1991 demo tape of his band Deli Creeps, titled "Tribal Rites," and again as bonus material in Buckethead's Secret Recipe DVD in 2006. Luke Sacco was his teacher.After his first two demo tapes, called Giant Robot (demo) and Bucketheadland Blueprints, Buckethead released Bucketheadland on John Zorn's Japanese Avant record label in 1992. Though available only as a pricey import, the record received positive reviews and earned some attention. At about this time, Buckethead fell into the orbit of prolific bassist/producer Bill Laswell, himself an occasional Zorn collaborator; Buckethead (as a performer, producer, or composer) was introduced to Laswell with the help of Limbomaniacs drummer Bryan "Brain" Mantia, who gave Laswell a video of Buckethead playing in his room.[11] Buckethead soon became Laswell's second staple guitar player, besides Nicky Skopelitis.In 1992, Buckethead, with Bill Laswell, Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins, and Bryan "Brain" Mantia, formed the supergroup Praxis. Their first album, Transmutation (Mutatis Mutandis), released the same year, was well received. The project was Bill Laswell's concept, and has since involved other guests such as Serj Tankian of System of a Down, among many others. Buckethead did participate in all releases except the initial 1984 release and Mold (1998).In 1994, Buckethead released an album called Dreamatorium under the name of Death Cube K (an anagram of "Buckethead"). The name was created by Tom "Doc" Darter to circumvent legal complications with Sony Music Entertainment. About his style, the official FAQ says,Many believe, however, that Death Cube K is a separate entity that looks like a photographic negative version of Buckethead with a "black chrome mask, like Darth Vader. This apparition haunts Buckethead and appears in his nightmares.[12]Science fiction author William Gibson later borrowed "Death Cube K" as the name of a bar in his novel Idoru (1996). Gibson explained the reference in an interview for Addicted to Noise:Death Cube K is actually the title of an album. I'm sorry I can't remember the name of the group, but Bill Laswell, who I don't really know but out of the kindness of his heart occasionally sends me big hunks of his output, groups that come out on his label. And Death Cube K was the title of some vicious ambient group that he had produced. And when I saw it, I thought: a Franz Kafka theme bar in Tokyo.Also in 1994, Buckethead released his second studio album, Giant Robot, which features many guest appearances by artists such as Iggy Pop and Bill Moseley. The name of the album came from the Japanese series Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot, of which Buckethead is a fan.[13] He also released two other albums with Praxis, their second and third studio efforts: Sacrifist and Metatron.According to Anthony Kiedis' autobiography, Scar Tissue, Buckethead once auditioned in 1993 to play guitar for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, without having heard any of their songs. The band's bassist Flea noted that "When he finished, the band applauded raucously. He was "sweet and normal", but they wanted someone "...who could also kick a groove."[14]The band eventually ended up with guitarist Dave Navarro.In 1995, Buckethead did not release any solo albums but collaborated with several artists like Jonas Hellborg and Michael Shrieve (Octave of the Holy Innocents). He also contributed to several movie soundtracks, such as Johnny Mnemonic and Mortal Kombat.Later, in 1996, Buckethead released his solo album The Day of the Robot with the help of English producer DJ Ninj and Laswell, plus another album with Brain and keyboardist Pete Scaturro on the small Japanese label NTT Records, called Giant Robot. Both albums were printed only in small quantities and are collectors' items now. A second demo tape by the Deli Creeps was also recorded.Also in 1996 several Sega Saturn television ads featuring a screaming mask-like face pressing through the blue orb of the Saturn logo was released, with music by Buckethead.In 1997, Buckethead began working on the album Buckethead Plays Disney, but the album has not yet been released. According to his Web page:This highly anticipated album, once listed in an Avant catalog, has yet to be completed. It is Buckethead's most precious personal project, so he won't record or release it until he knows he is ready.[15]Also in 1997, Buckethead continued to contribute to movie soundtracks, appearing on Beverly Hills Ninja and Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, the sequel to Mortal Kombat.Further releases were Arcana's second and final studio album Arc of the Testimony and the one-off project Pieces, with Brain. Two live albums by Praxis, called Transmutation Live and Live in Poland (featuring recordings from European concerts) were also issued.Death Cube K released an album that year called Disembodied.In 1998, Buckethead released Colma, an album dedicated to his mother, who was sick during this time with colon cancer.[16] The same year saw a compilation album by Praxis called Collection.In 1999, Buckethead released his fifth album, a collaboration with Les Claypool from the band Primus, titled Monsters and Robots  currently the best-selling album of his career. This album includes the song "The Ballad of Buckethead," for which his first music video ever was made.[17]Also in this year, he started three new projects, the first being the band Cornbugs, a collaboration with actor Bill Moseley, drummer Pinchface, and later keyboardist Travis Dickerson. Another project, Cobra Strike with an album called The 13th Scroll, featured Pinchface, Bryan "Brain" Mantia, DJ Disk, and Bill Laswell. Buckethead also recorded with actor Viggo Mortensen, whom he first met through a recording project called Myth: Dreams of the World[18] in 1996. Together they released One Man's Meat, One Less Thing to Worry About, and The Other Parade. Those releases are quite rare now, but a compilation album called This, That, and The Other was issued in 2004 to compensate for this. A reworked version of Live in Poland by Praxis, called Warszawa, plus the soundtrack of the movie Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, also came out this year. Furthermore Buckethead offered fans to buy special half-hour long "personalized recordings" for a price of $50 each. Buyers could choose content out of several categories.[19]A third Death Cube K release followed, titled Tunnel, this time without Laswell but featuring Travis Dickerson instead. In 2000, Buckethead released the second and last album by Cobra Strike, called Cobra Strike II - Y, Y+B, X+Y.Buckethead achieved a higher public profile as lead guitarist for Guns N' Roses from 2000 to 2004.[20] He recorded the often-delayed album Chinese Democracy with the band and appeared live on stage in 2001 and 2002, including Rock in Rio 3, MTV's Video Music Awards, and parts of the Chinese Democracy Tour.Despite being a member of GN'R, Buckethead released his sixth studio album, called Somewhere Over the Slaughterhouse in 2001, and also his only EP, called KFC Skin Piles. He also released two albums with his band Cornbugs, Cemetery Pinch and How Now Brown Cow. He joined two new projects, the first being Thanatopsis, with Dickerson, releasing a self-titled debut album; the other one with Laswell and Japanese producer Shin Terai, released as Unison.In 2002, Buckethead released three studio albums: Funnel Weaver, a collection of 49 short tracks, Bermuda Triangle, and finally, Electric Tears, a calming album that is similar to his earlier release, Colma. When Laswell was not able to play with Praxis at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts festival, Les Claypool asked to jam with Brain, Bernie Worrell, and Buckethead, forming a new supergroup called Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains. The jamband experiment was successful enough to do some further live dates.Later, in 2003, marking the release of his tenth studio album, Buckethead released the sequel of his debut Bucketheadland, simply called Bucketheadland 2. Together with actor Viggo Mortensen, he did Pandemoniumfromamerica, and with Thanatopsis, its second release, called Axiology.In March 2004 Buckethead left Guns N' Roses, according to his manager, because of Guns' inability to complete an album or tour.[21]Guns N' Roses' response after Buckethead's departure was as follows:During his tenure with the band, Buckethead has been inconsistent and erratic in both his behavior and his commitment, despite being under contract, creating uncertainty and confusion and making it virtually impossible to move forward with recording, rehearsals, and live plans with confidence. His transient lifestyle has made it near impossible for even his closest friends to have nearly any form of communications with him whatsoever. Axl Rose[22]Since that time, his cult following in the underground music communities has steadily increased. He frequently performs at festivals and in clubs nationwide and often tours as the feature performer.[23][24]The year 2004 saw the release of three new studio albums: Island of Lost Minds, which was his first tour-only album being later re-released by TDRS Music Population Override, a blues-rock tour de force with Dickerson; and The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell, considered his heaviest effort to date. The latter includes "Spokes for the Wheel of Torment," for which Syd Garon and Eric Henry made a music video based on the famous triptychs by Hieronymus Bosch. Buckethead also recorded the final two albums by the Cornbugs, Brain Circus and Donkey Town as well as another release with Viggo Mortensen called Please Tomorrow and a second with Shin Terai, titled Heaven & Hell. C2B3 also released their only album, The Big Eyeball in the Sky, and toured it in North America.In an interview with Revolver, Ozzy Osbourne stated that he had offered to have Buckethead play guitar in his band at Ozzfest. Ozzy quickly changed his mind after meeting with him, and realizing that Buckethead would not remove his costume to be accepted by Ozzy, said:"I tried out that Buckethead guy. I met with him and asked him to work with me, but only if he got rid of the fucking bucket. So I came back a bit later, and he's wearing this green fucking Martian's-hat thing! I said, 'Look, just be yourself.' He told me his name was Brian, so I said that's what I'd call him. He says, 'No one calls me Brian except my mother.' So I said, 'Pretend I'm your mum, then!' I haven't even got out of the room and I'm already playing fucking mind games with the guy. What happens if one day he's gone and there's a note saying, 'I've been beamed up'? Don't get me wrong, he's a great player. He plays like a motherfucker."[25]In 2005, Buckethead released an album as "Buckethead & Friends," called Enter the Chicken, through Serj Tankian's record label, Serjical Strike. The album features Tankian himself, Maximum Bob (of the Deli Creeps), Death by Stereo singer Efrem Shulz, Bad Acid Trip, and others.[26] It is marked by its leaning toward more traditional song structures while still featuring typical Buckethead guitar skills. "We Are One" was released as a single and also appeared on the soundtrack of Masters of Horror. "Three Fingers" was used for the soundtrack of the horror movie Saw II. The final track, "Nottingham Lace," was first made public via his home page and soon became a concert staple and one of his most popular songs. Buckethead also released two further solo albums in 2005, Kaleidoscalp and Inbred Mountain  the latter being the first album as a solo artist released on the label TDRS Music. Both albums originally were sold exclusively at concerts and only later got an official release through the label's website.Also the same year, Buckethead released his first DVD, Secret Recipe, originally sold only on tour; the only places for other fans (those who either didn't go to a show or who lived abroad) to obtain it were auction sites such as eBay. Eventually, Travis Dickerson held a raffle for copies of the DVD on his website. Those who wanted to "win" a copy had to enter their name and e-mail address. When entries were closed, he picked 200 names at random from those who entered, and they were allowed to buy a copy of the DVD from his website. In March 2006, the DVD was finally made widely available.Also, Buckethead released albums with other bands: with Cornbugs, he released two compilation albums, called Rest Home for Robots and Skeleton Farm; he also released (with the band Deli Creeps) their first and only album, called Dawn of the Deli Creeps. Buckethead also released self-titled album Gorgone with studio project Gorgone. This album was recorded from one of the recording sessions from the album Population Override that Buckethead released on 2004. The guitarist also released an album with the actor Viggo Mortensen called Intelligence Failure, and with the band Praxis, released a live album called Zurich.In 2006, the highlight of the year was the cross-console video game Guitar Hero II, featuring Buckethead's song "Jordan" as an unlockable bonus track. Although the song has been performed live in the past, the video game version is the only known studio recording of the song. Also, the live version almost always contains just the verse and chorus of "Jordan"; then goes into another song, usually "Post Office Buddy"; then returns to the verse and chorus of "Jordan." However, the Guitar Hero II version contains a special solo created specifically for the game.[27] Since late 2007, Buckethead has been known to perform the Guitar Hero version of "Jordan" within his concerts, including the solo.Also the same year, Buckethead released two DVDs, titled Young Buckethead Vol. 1 and Young Buckethead Vol. 2, featuring rare footage from 1990 and 1991. The DVD also contains three complete Deli Creeps shows, a sound check, backstage footage, and solo footage of just Buckethead. He also released the albums The Elephant Man's Alarm Clock and Crime Slunk Scene, both sold on his tours but later sold on the TDRS Music website. The last album has the song "Soothsayer (Dedicated to Aunt Suzie)"; this song (along with "Jordan" and "Nottingham Lace") is one of his most popular songs and is often played live.In the same year, Buckethead released his final compilation album with the band Cornbugs, called Celebrity Psychos. He also released an album with producer, keyboardist, and owner of the label TDRS Music, Travis Dickerson, called Chicken Noodles, which was inspired by the track "Cruel Reality of Nature," from the album Population Override. He also released an album with the band Thanatopsis, called Anatomize.In 2007, Buckethead released an unprecedented amount of new material. In February, a box set titled In Search of The, containing 13 albums of original material, was released. It was handcrafted, numbered, and monogrammed by Buckethead and contained over nine hours of music. A regular solo album, called Pepper's Ghost, was released in March. A disc of acoustic improvisations called Acoustic Shards was also released, becoming the twentieth studio album that the artist had released so far in his solo career. In midyear, he reissued his demo tape Bucketheadland Blueprints, with two alternative album covers: a special edition with a hand-drawn cover made by him, or a standard edition with the original cover art. In October, he released his final two albums of the year, called Decoding the Tomb of Bansheebot and Cyborg Slunks. The latter again came in both a hand-drawn limited edition and (some weeks later) as a normal CD.As Death Cube K, Buckethead released two albums in 2007: an album called DCK, limited to 400 hand-numbered copies and released in August; and in December, the 5-CD box set Monolith, which consisted of one unbroken track per CD.[28]During 2007, Buckethead also collaborated and appeared on numerous albums with other artists. The sequel to Chicken Noodles (a collaboration with Travis Dickerson), simply called Chicken Noodles II, was issued by TDRS in December.[29] A live record by Praxis, titled Tennessee 2004; the third album with Shin Terai, called Lightyears; and another album with drummer Bryan Mantia, called Kevin's Noodle House, were also released through the year.Buckethead also created five paintings, each limited to 100 reproductions each and sold through TDRS.[30]That same year, it was revealed that Buckethead joined a project by the name of Science Faxtion, a band featuring bassist Bootsy Collins and drummer Bryan "Brain" Mantia, with Greg Hampton supplying lead vocals. Their first album, called Living on Another Frequency, was delayed several times and was finally released in November 2008.On January 1, 2008, the band Praxis released the long-awaited album Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness) in Japan. The album had actually been recorded in 2005, but had to be put on hold when the original label went bankrupt.2008 started with the release of From the Coop through the label Avabella (where he released Acoustic Shards), consisting of the demos Buckethead gave to Jas Obrecht back in 1988. This CD also included the first ever "official" biography of/by the artist. Later that same year, he announced the release of the album called Albino Slug (a tour-only CD until official release on December of the same year). Along with this album, he appeared on the album The Dragons of Eden, with Dickerson and Mantia, and in collaboration with That 1 Guy as the Frankenstein Brothers, an album called Bolt on Neck was released. That 1 Guy and Buckethead toured together through fall 2008, playing songs from this album.Buckethead also appeared in the documentary American Music: Off the Record, in which he appears only playing.[31] Serj Tankian's label, Serjical Strike, reissued the album Enter the Chicken with an extra song. Furthermore, Buckethead contributed to one track of actor Viggo Mortensen's album At All, and with Travis Dickerson and filmmaker Alix Lambert on the album Running After Deer.Buckethead appeared with Bootsy Collins in Cincinnati, Ohio, to promote the vote for the United States presidential election, 2008 for the organization Rock the Vote.[32] He also joined Collins on Fallen Soldiers Memorial, an album with proceeds going to the National Fallen Heroes Foundation.[33]More than four years after his departure from the band Guns N' Roses, Chinese Democracy was made available.

The album features eleven of Buckethead's guitar solos.On December 30, 2008, Buckethead released two new tracks via his website to honor the 24th birthday of basketball player LeBron James.[34][35] These tracks were later made available on the album, Slaughterhouse on the Prairie which was released a month later through TDRS Music. Then, in May 2009 he released the album A Real Diamond in the Rough, and later another album called Forensic Follies, which was first sold at some of his tour dates but later released on TDRS.Buckethead released a song in 2009 titled "The Homing Beacon" on his website, along with a drawing of Michael Jackson to serve as a tribute to the late singer after he saw the news of his death. Three years later, the song was released as the final track on Electric Sea, Buckethead's first album of 2012.Following the sound of Forensic Follies, in September he released Needle in a Slunk Stack and a month later he released the long awaited album as Death Cube K, called Torn from Black Space.By the end of the year, on November 13, Gibson announced a Buckethead signature Les Paul.[36] The guitar was part of the series of releases made through the whole month. In December he collaborated on the debut album of Travis Dickerson (founder of the label TDRS Music where he has released many of his albums to date), called Iconography.On February 5, 2010, Buckethead released an album called Shadows Between the Sky and later that month, Gibson released the Buckethead Signature Les Paul.[37]On April 29, 2010, Buckethead's Web site was updated[38] with a picture with the message "Greetings from Bucketheadland... Buckethead wants you to know he appreciates your support all these years, it means so much to him. Buckethead is having some animatronic parts replaced, Slip Disc snuck into the park and caused some mayhem." The reference to Slip Disc is a reference to a Bucketheadland nemesis found on the Bucketheadland album. Bootsy Collins continued to update his Twitter Web site about Buckethead's condition, stating that he had recently gone into therapy for a few months.Nevertheless, after return from injury, on July 15, 2010, Buckethead, along with Brain and Melissa Reese, has released the first volume out of three 5-CD box sets called Best Regards.

Along with the drawings, Buckethead auctioned off the three original paintings released in 2007 with two new paintings.In October, two albums in collaboration with Brain were released, the first called Brain as Hamenoodle, and the second installment of the "Regards" series with Brain and Melissa Reese called, Kind Regards. Eventually, both projects were released on October 13.In Mid-October Travis Dickerson announced via the TDRS Music forum,[39] that he has been working on several new projects. One of them turned out to be Left Hanging, an album on which Buckethead is collaborating with him.

It was later announced that a physical edition will be released on December 1.[40] Eventually, both CD's were released on November 29.[41]On December 20, Buckethead's Web site was updated[38] with a new song and pictures of Rammellzee, a visual artist, graffiti writer, performance artist, hip hop musician, art theoretician and sculptor from New York, with the words "Hero of the Abyss" appearing above the photos. Much speculation had arisen about this new song. It was considered to be a tribute to Rammellzee, as the artist died in his birthplace of Far Rockaway, Queens, New York, on June 28, 2010 at the age of 49.On December 21, Buckethead released a limited-edition album titled Happy Holidays From Buckethead, with a holiday greeting card included.

Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of fourteen to pursue a career in country music. She signed to the independent label Big Machine Records and became the youngest songwriter ever hired by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. The release of Swift's eponymous debut album in 2006 established her as a country music star. "Our Song", her third single, made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number one song on the country chart. She received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2008 Grammy Awards.Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the crossover success of the singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless became the top-selling album of 2009 and was supported by an extensive concert tour. The record won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest ever Album of the Year winner. Swift's third album, 2010's Speak Now, sold over one million copies in its first week of US release and was supported by the thirteen-month Speak Now World Tour. The album's third single, "Mean", won two Grammy Awards. Swift's fourth album, Red, was released in 2012. Its opening US sales of 1.21 million were the highest recorded in a decade, with Swift becoming the only female artist to have two million-plus opening weeks. The lead single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", was Swift's first number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became a worldwide hit. The Red Tour is scheduled to begin in March 2013.Swift is known for her hook-laden, narrative songs about her experiences as a teenager and young adult. As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Swift's other achievements include six Grammy Awards, eleven American Music Awards, seven Country Music Association Awards, six Academy of Country Music Awards and thirteen BMI Awards. She has sold over 26 million albums and 70 million song downloads worldwide. In addition to her music career, Swift has appeared as an actress in the crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2009), the ensemble comedy Valentine's Day (2010) and the animated film The Lorax (2012). Forbes estimates that she is worth over $165 million. As a philanthropist, Swift supports arts education, children's literacy, natural disaster relief, LGBT rights, and charities for sick children.Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989 in Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a Merrill Lynch financial adviser.[2][3] He was raised in Pennsylvania and is the descendant of three generations of bank presidents.[1][4] Her mother, Andrea (ne Finlay), is a homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[5] Andrea spent the first ten years of her life in Singapore, before settling in Texas; her father was an oil rig engineer who worked throughout Southeast Asia.[4] Swift was named after singer James Taylor; her mother believed a gender-neutral name would help her forge a successful business career.[6][7] She has a younger brother, Austin, who attends the University of Notre Dame.[8] She spent the early years of her life on an eleven-acre Christmas tree farm in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania and was educated at the fee-paying Wyndcroft School.[9] When Swift was nine years old, the family moved to Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[10] where she attended West Reading Elementary Center and Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[11] She spent her summers at her parents' vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey and has described it as the place "where most of my childhood memories were formed".[12]Swift's first hobby was English horse riding. Her mother put her in a saddle when she was nine months old; Swift later competed in horse shows.[13][14] Her family owned several Quarter horses and a Shetland pony.[14] At the age of nine, Swift turned her attention to musical theatre and performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions of Grease, Annie, Bye Bye Birdie and The Sound of Music.[15] She traveled regularly to Broadway, New York for vocal and acting lessons. However, "after a few years of auditioning in New York and not getting anything", Swift became interested in country music.[16] She spent her weekends performing at local festivals, fairs, coffeehouses, karaoke contests, garden clubs, Boy Scout meetings and hospitals.[5][17][18] At the age of eleven, after many attempts,[19] Swift won a local talent competition by singing a rendition of LeAnn Rimes's "Big Deal", and was given the opportunity to appear as the opening act for Charlie Daniels at a Strausstown amphitheater.[15] This growing ambition and interest in country music began to isolate Swift from her middle school peers.[1]After watching a Behind the Music episode about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue a music career.[10] She traveled with her mother to Nashville for spring break to leave a demo of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers with record labels along Music Row.[20] She received label rejections and realized that "everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different".[21] She began performing the "The Star Spangled Banner" at sporting events because it was an opportunity to "get in front of 20,000 people without even having a record deal".[4] At the age of twelve, Swift was shown by a computer repairman how to play three chords on a guitar, inspiring her to write her first song, "Lucky You".[22] She had previously won a national poetry contest with a poem entitled "Monster in My Closet" but now began to focus on songwriting.[23] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow. With Dymtrow's help, Swift modelled for Abercrombie and Fitch as part of their "Rising Stars" campaign, had an original song included in a Maybelline Cosmetics compilation CD and took meetings with major record labels.[24] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, the eight-grader was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville.[25]When Swift was fourteen, her father transferred to the Nashville office of Merrill Lynch and the family relocated to a lake-shore house in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[1] Swift later described this as "an incredible sacrifice" for her family to make.[20] Her parents "presented it as a move to a nice community" rather than as her chance to become a star,[26] and her mother has said, "We've always told her that this is not about putting food on our table or making our dreams come true."[27] In Tennessee, Swift attended Hendersonville High School for her freshman and sophomore years.[28] Later, to accommodate her touring schedule, Swift transferred to the Aaron Academy, a private Christian school which offered homeschooling services. She earned her high school diploma in 2008, having finished her final two years of course work in twelve months.[29][30]Swift moved to Nashville at the age of fourteen. As part of her artist development deal with RCA Records, she had writing sessions with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally and The Warren Brothers.[31][32] She eventually formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[33] Swift saw Rose performing at an RCA songwriter event and suggested that they write together.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose has said that the sessions were "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks".[36] Swift also began recording demos with producer Nathan Chapman.[34] After performing at a BMI Songwriter's Circle showcase at The Bitter End, New York,[32] Swift became the youngest songwriter ever hired by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house.[37] She left RCA Records when she was fifteen; the company wanted her to record the work of other songwriters and wait until she was eighteen to release an album, but she felt ready to launch her career with her own material.[19][38] She also parted ways with manager Dan Dymtrow, who later took legal action against Swift and her parents.[24] "'I genuinely felt that I was running out of time," Swift later recalled. "I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through."[39] At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Caf in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a Dreamworks Records executive who was preparing to form his own independent record label, Big Machine Records. She became one of the label's first signings,[33] with her father purchasing a three per cent stake in the fledgling company.[40] As an introduction to the country music business, Borchetta arranged for Swift to intern as an artist escort at the CMA Music Festival.[41]Swift began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after signing her record deal. After experimenting with veteran Nashville producers, Swift persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman. It was his first time to record a studio album but Swift felt they had the right "chemistry".[19] In the end, Chapman produced all but one of the tracks on Taylor Swift. She has described the album as the "diary" of her early teens.[42] She has said that, although "it sounds like I've had 500 boyfriends", a lot of the songs are observational.[19] Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, including two singles, and co-wrote the remaining eight with writers such as Liz Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall and Angelo Petraglia.[43] Musically, the album has been described as "a mix of trad-country instruments and spry rock guitars".[44] Taylor Swift was released in October 2006. The New York Times described it as "a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice."[45] PopMatters hoped Swift would be "able to find an accomodation between the country tradition and her very obvious pop sensibilities, because Taylor Swift suggests she has much to offer".[46] The New Yorker's Sasha Frere-Jones described Swift as a "prodigy". He noted that "Our Song" "stop[ed] me in my tracks" and praised the lyrics: "He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel, the other on my heart".[47] Country Weekly felt that "the more thoughtful material suggests a talent poised to last well past high school".[48] Rolling Stone described Swift as "bright-eyed but remarkably seasoned", and admired "Our Song"'s "insanely hooky sing-song melody that's as Britney as it is Patsy".[44]Big Machine Records was still in its infancy upon the release of the lead single "Tim McGraw" in June 2006, and Swift and her mother helped "stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio".[27] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift in a radio tour and later commented, "Radio tours for most artists last six weeks. Mine lasted six months."[19] Swift baked cookies and painted canvases (inspired by Jackson Pollock) to gift to radio station programmers who played her music.[49] She made many television appearances, including on the Grand Ole Opry,[50] Good Morning America,[51] and TRL.[52] She also signed endorsement deals, appearing as a spokesmodel for l.e.i. jeans and as the face of Verizon Wireless' Mobile Music campaign.[53][54] Swift, a self-described "kid of the internet", used MySpace to build a fanbase.[55] She wrote her own blog posts, left comments on her fans' accounts and personally respond to the messages that were sent to her.[56] This was, at the time, "revolutionary in country music".[57] Borchetta has said that his decision to sign a sixteen-year-old singer-songwriter initially raised eyebrows among his record industry peers but Swift tapped into a previously unknown market: teenage girls who listen to country music.[57] Following "Tim McGraw", four further singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song", "Picture to Burn" and "Should've Said No". All were highly successful on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, with "Our Song" and "Should've Said No" both reaching number one. "Our Song" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number one country song.[58] "Teardrops on My Guitar" became a minor pop hit; it reached number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100.[59] The album sold 39,000 copies during its first week of release[60] and, as of March 2011, has sold over 5.5 million copies worldwide.[61] Swift also released a holiday album, Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection, in October 2007 and an EP, Beautiful Eyes, in July 2008.[62][63]Swift toured extensively in support of Taylor Swift. In addition to festival and theater dates, Swift performed as an opening act for several country artists' concert tours. In late 2006, she opened for Rascal Flatts on the final nine dates of their Me & My Gang Tour, after the previous supporting act Eric Church was fired.[51] Swift later sent Church her first gold record with a note: "Thanks for playing too long and too loud on the Flatts tour. I sincerely appreciate it. Taylor".[64] In 2007, she served as the opening act on twenty dates for George Strait's tour,[65] several dates on Kenny Chesney's Flip-Flop Summer Tour,[66] selected dates on Brad Paisley's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour[67] and several dates for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill's joint Soul2Soul II Tour.[68] Swift again opened for Rascal Flatts on their Still Feels Good Tour in 2008.[69] In addition to performing her own material, Swift played covers of songs by Beyonc, Rihanna, John Waite, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Eminem.[70][71][72] She conducted meet-and-greet sessions with fans before and after her concerts; these lasted for up to four hours.[73]In 2007, Swift and Alan Jackson were jointly named the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year. Swift was the youngest person ever to be honored with the title.[74] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist.[75] In 2008, she was named Top New Female Vocalist at the Academy of Country Music Awards[76] and Favorite Country Female Artist at the American Music Awards.[77] She received seven BMI Awards for songs featured on Taylor Swift.[78] Swift was also nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award in the category of Best New Artist, but lost to Amy Winehouse.[79]Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released in November 2008. Swift wrote seven of the album's songs alone, including two singles, and co-wrote the remaining six with songwriters Liz Rose, John Rich, Colbie Caillat and Hillary Lindsey.[80] She co-produced the album with Nathan Chapman.[80] Musically, it has been said that the record is characterized by "loud, lean guitars and rousing choruses", with the occasional "bit of fiddle and banjo tucked into the mix".[81] The New York Times described Swift as "one of pop's finest songwriters, country's foremost pragmatist and more in touch with her inner life than most adults".[82] The Village Voice felt she displayed "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness", "masterfully avoiding the typical diarist's pitfalls of trite banality and pseudo-profound bullshit".[83] Rolling Stone described her as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture" whose "squirmingly intimate and true" songs seemed to be "literally ripped from a suburban girl's diary".[81] USA Today found it "a pleasure to hear a gifted teenager who sounds like a gifted teenager, rather than a mouthpiece for a bunch of older pros' collective notion of adolescent yearning."[84] The New Yorker described it as an album "without a bad track", adding that "the album's finest effort, "Fifteen", will feature in yearbook quotes for years".[85] Entertainment Weekly noted that the album would appeal mainly to young girls  "she sounds like a real teen, not some manufactured vixen-Lolita"  but predicted it would be "exciting to watch her precocious talent grow".[86] Music critic Robert Christgau described Swift as "an uncommonly-to-impossibly strong and gifted teenage girl".[87]Swift promoted Fearless heavily upon its release. An episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show was dedicated to the album launch[57] and Swift appeared on many other chat shows.[88] She communicated with fans using social media platforms such as Twitter and personal video blogs.[57] She launched a l.e.i. sundress range at Wal-Mart,[89] as well as a line of American Greetings cards and Jakks Pacific dolls.[90][91] She became a spokesperson for the NHL's Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras,[92][93] and performed in a commercial for the Band Hero video game, with Rivers Cuomo, Pete Wentz and Travis Barker appearing as her backing band.[94] The singer paid tribute to a number of fellow artists in televised performances: she performed a cover of Alan Jackson's "Drive (For Daddy Gene)" at the CMT Giants: Alan Jackson event,[95] took part in a joint, televised concert with rock band Def Leppard in Nashville,[96][97] and performed a cover of George Strait's "Run" at a televised ACM event honoring Strait as the Artist of the Decade.[98] Swift sang her song "Fifteen" with Miley Cyrus at the 51st Grammy Awards,[99] performed a self-penned rap skit with T-Pain at the CMT Awards[100] and hosted Saturday Night Live.[101] The lead single from the album, "Love Story", was released in September 2008 and became the second best-selling country single of all time, peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[102] Four more singles were released throughout 2008 and 2009: "White Horse", "You Belong with Me", "Fifteen" and "Fearless". "You Belong with Me" was the album's highest-charting single, peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[103] The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Album Chart with sales of 592,304 and has since sold over 8.6 million copies worldwide.[104] It was the top-selling album of 2009 and brought Swift much crossover success.[105]Swift carried out her first headlining tour from April 2009 to June 2010. As part of the 105-date Fearless Tour, Swift played 90 dates in North America, six dates in Europe, eight dates in Australia and one date in Asia.[106] The elaborate stage set included a fairy-tale castle and a high school bandstand.[107] She sang a cover of Justin Timberlake's "What Goes Around... Comes Around" nightly, intertwined with her own "You're Not Sorry".[108] Swift invited John Mayer, Faith Hill and Katy Perry to perform one-off duets with her at various dates during the North American tour.[109][110][111] Justin Bieber, Kellie Pickler and Gloriana were the support acts.[112] The tour was attended by more than 1.1 million fans and grossed over $63 million.[113] Taylor Swift: Journey to Fearless, a concert film, was aired on television and later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[114] Also in 2009, Swift performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban's Escape Together World Tour.[115]In September 2009, Swift became the first country music artist to win an MTV Video Music Award when "You Belong with Me" was named Best Female Video.[116] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West, who had been involved in a number of other award show incidents.[117] West declared Beyonc's video for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", nominated in the same category, to be "one of the best videos of all time." Many audience members booed West,[118] prompting him to flip off the crowd.[119] He then handed the microphone back to a speechless Swift.[118] Backstage, Swift was seen "hysterically crying".[118] According to Rolling Stone, when Swift's mother confronted West, he gave "a half-hearted apology in which he added he still thought Beyonc's video was superior".[120] West was removed from the event.[118] When Beyonc later won the award for Video of the Year, she invited Swift onstage to finish her speech.[118] In the event's press room, Swift, who in 2008 had expressed a desire to sing a hook on a Kanye West rap song,[121] was asked if she had "any hard feelings" towards West: "I don't know him, and I've never met him, so... I don't want to start anything because I had a great night tonight."[120][122] The incident received much media attention and inspired many Internet memes.[123] President Barack Obama, in an off the record comment, called West a "jackass".[124] Former US President Jimmy Carter said West's interruption was "completely uncalled for".[125] West's behavior was criticized by celebrities, including Eminem, Snoop Dogg and Madonna.[126][127][128] West apologized for his verbal outburst in two blog entries and during an appearance on The Jay Leno Show.[118][129] He maintained that, while Swift was "very talented", "Beyonc's video was the best of this decade!!!! ... I gave my awards to Outkast when they deserved it over me ... I'm not crazy y'all, I'm just real."[130] Two days after the VMAs, Swift told an interviewer that West had not spoken to her since the ceremony.[131] West then contacted her to offer a personal apology, which Swift accepted: "Kanye did call me, and he was very sincere in his apology."[116] She refused to discuss the incident in subsequent interviews so as not to make a "bigger deal" of it: "It happened on TV, so everybody saw what happened ... It's not something I feel like we need to keep talking about."[132] It has been said that the incident and subsequent media attention turned Swift into "a bona-fide mainstream celebrity".[133]Swift released a cover of Tom Petty's "American Girl" through Rhapsody in June 2009[134] and continues to make her stage entrance to Petty's recording of the song.[135] She contributed backing vocals to John Mayer's "Half of My Heart", a single featured on his fourth album, in November 2009. Mayer wrote the song as a tribute to Tom Petty and Fleetwood Mac: "I thought, 'Well, if this is going to be my love letter to that style of music, who's going to be the Stevie Nicks in this equation?' And I thought, 'This Taylor Swift girl is going to be around for a long time."[136] Swift collaborated with a number of other artists in 2008 and 2009. She co-wrote and recorded "Best Days of Your Life" with Kellie Pickler.[137] She co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack  "You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home" and "Crazier"  with Martin Johnson and Robert Ellis Orrall, respectively.[138] Swift also provided vocals for Boys Like Girls's "Two Is Better Than One", written by Martin Johnson.[139] In January 2010, Swift contributed two songs  including "Today Was a Fairytale"  to the Valentine's Day soundtrack[140] and recorded a cover of Better Than Ezra's "Breathless" for the Hope for Haiti Now album.[141]Swift won four Grammy Awards in January 2010, from a total of eight nominations.[142] Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, while "White Horse" was named Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[143] She was the youngest ever artist to win Album of the Year.[144] During the ceremony, Swift sang "Rhiannon" and "You Belong with Me" with Stevie Nicks. Her vocal performance received negative reviews and sparked a widespread media backlash.[133][145] Her vocals were described variously as "badly off-key", "strikingly bad" and "incredibly wretched".[146][147] While The New York Times found it "refreshing to see someone so gifted make the occasional flub" and described Swift as "the most important new pop star of the past few years",[144] music analyst Bob Lefsetz predicted that her career would end "overnight" and publicly appealed to Swift's father to hire a "crisis publicity agent" to manage the story because "Taylor's too young and dumb to understand the mistake she made".[148][149] In April 2010, Stevie Nicks, writing in Time, defended the singer: "Taylor reminds me of myself in her determination and her childlike nature. It's an innocence that's so special and so rare. This girl writes the songs that make the whole world sing, like Neil Diamond or Elton John ... The female rock-'n'-roll-country-pop songwriter is back, and her name is Taylor Swift. And it's women like her who are going to save the music business."[150] Fearless won many other accolades and has become the most awarded album in country music history.[151] Swift became the youngest ever artist and one of only six women to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association.[152] Fearless also won the Association's Album of the Year award.[152] She was the youngest ever artist to win the Academy of Country Music's Album of the Year honor.[153] The American Music Awards honored Swift with Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album plaudits.[154] She was awarded the Hal David Starlight Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame[155] and was named Songwriter/Artists of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association.[156] She won four BMI Awards.[157] Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year.[158] Swift was included in Time's annual list of the 100 Most Influential People in 2010.[150]Swift released her third studio album, Speak Now, in October 2010. She wrote all twelve songs alone.[159] Swift, who co-produced the record with longtime collaborator Nathan Chapman,[160] has described it as "a collection of confessionsthings I wish I had said when I was in the moment".[161] She originally intended to call the album Enchanted but Scott Borchetta, her record label's CEO, felt the title did not reflect the album's more adult themes.[162] Musically, it has been said that the album "expands beyond country-pop to border both alternative rock and dirty bubblegum pop".[163] USA Today felt that Swift's songwriting skills would remind listeners "what all the fuss was about in the first place", with the album capturing "the sweet ache of becoming an adult".[164] The Los Angeles Times praised her ability as a songwriter to "hit on common experiences that feel unique".[163] The New York Times described the album as savage, musically diverse and "excellent too, possibly her best".[160] The Village Voice found that the album demanded "a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic: Like a procession of country songwriters before her, she creates characters and situationssome from lifeand finds potent ways to describe them."[165] Entertainment Weekly noted that, while love may confound her, "the art of expert songcraft clearly doesn't".[166] Music critic John Christgau found the album's songs "overlong and overworked" but remarked that "they evince an effort that bears a remarkable resemblance to carethat is, to caring in the best, broadest, and most emotional sense".[87] Rolling Stone described Swift as one of the best songwriters in "pop, rock or country": "Swift might be a clever Nashville pro who knows all the hitmaking tricks, but she's also a high-strung, hyper-romantic gal with a melodramatic streak the size of the Atchafalaya Swamp".[167]Swift carried out an extensive promotional campaign prior to Speak Now's release.[168] She appeared on various talk shows and morning shows, and gave free mini-concerts in unusual locations, including an open-decker bus on Hollywood Boulevard and a departure lounge at JFK airport.[169][170] She took part in a "guitar pull" alongside Kris Kristofferson, Emmylou Harris, Vince Gill and Lionel Ritchie at LA's Club Nokia; the musicians shared the stage and took turns introducing and playing acoustic versions of their songs to raise money for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.[171][172] In addition to her pre-existing Sony Electronics and American Greetings endorsements, Swift also became a CoverGirl spokesmodel,[173] launched an Elizabeth Arden fragrance entitled Wonderstruck[174] and released a special edition of Speak Now through Target.[175] The album's lead single, "Mine", was released in August 2010 and five further singles were released throughout 2010 and 2011: "Back to December", "Mean", "The Story of Us", "Sparks Fly" and "Ours".[176] Speak Now was a major commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. Its sales of 1,047,000 copies made it the sixteenth album in US history to sell one million copies in a single week.[177] As of February 2012, Speak Now has sold over 5.7 million copies worldwide.[178][179]In September 2010, Kanye West used his Twitter account to apologize to Swift for his 2009 VMA interruption, referring to her as "just a lil girl with dreams like the rest of us": "I wrote a song for Taylor Swift that's so beautiful and I want her to have it. If she won't take it then I'll perform it for her."[180] At the 2010 VMAs later that month, Swift sang "Innocent", a song widely believed to be about West, which The Washington Post described as "a small masterpiece of passive aggressiveness, a vivisection dressed up as a peace offering".[181] Music critics found Swift's performance overly serious and "petty".[182][183] In October 2010, West remarked that it was "inaccurate" for Swift's Fearless to have been named Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards earlier that year.[184] Speaking in November 2010, West said he failed to see what was "so arrogant" about his VMA interruption and described his actions as "selfless".[185][186] He argued it was "just disrespectful" and "retarded" for Swift to be included in the same award category as Beyonc.[187] He added that "if it was the other way around" and Swift were an established artist who had "made the video of her career, do you think she would have lost to a brand new artist? Hell no!"[185][186] He claimed that his interruption caused Swift to "have 100 magazine covers and sell a million first week".[187] Also that month, he claimed that, "If I wasn't drunk, I would have been on stage longer ... Taylor never came to my defense at any interview. And rode the waves and rode it and rode it".[188][189] At the Costume Institute Gala in May 2011, Swift and West came face-to-face on the red carpet. West was observed to hold "a hand out, and the two exchanged a studiedly casual, "down low" high five".[1]Swift toured throughout 2011 and early 2012 in support of Speak Now. As part of the thirteen-month, 111-date world tour, Swift played seven shows in Asia, twelve shows in Europe, 80 shows in North America and twelve shows in Australasia.[190] The stage show was inspired by Broadway musical theatre, with choreographed routines, elaborate set-pieces, pyrotechnics and numerous costume changes.[191][192] Swift invited many musicians to join her for one-off duets during the North American tour. Appearances were made by James Taylor, Jason Mraz, Shawn Colvin, Johnny Rzeznik, Andy Grammer, Tal Bachman, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Nicki Minaj, Nelly, B.o.B, Usher, Flo Rida, T.I., Jon Foreman, Jim Adkins, Hayley Williams, Hot Chelle Rae, Ronnie Dunn, Darius Rucker, Tim McGraw and Kenny Chesney.[193][194] During the North American tour leg, Swift wrote different song lyrics on her left arm for each performance and has said that the lyrics should be viewed as a nightly "mood ring".[195][196] Swift performed many acoustic cover versions during her North American tour. In each city, she paid tribute to a homegrown artist.[197] She has said the cover versions allowed her to be "spontaneous" in an otherwise well-rehearsed show.[198] The tour was attended by over 1.6 million fans and grossed over $123 million.[190] Swift's first live album, Speak Now World Tour: Live, featuring all seventeen performances from the North American leg of the tour, was released in November 2011.[199] In July 2012, James Taylor invited Swift to appear as a special guest during his Tanglewood set; they performed "Fire and Rain", "Love Story" and "Ours" together.[200] Taylor, who first met Swift when she was eighteen, has said that, "we just hit it off. I loved her songs, and her presence on stage was so great".[201][202]At the 54th Grammy Awards in February 2012, Swift's song "Mean" won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.[203] She also performed the song during the ceremony. Bob Lefsetz, one of the most vocal critics of her 2010 Grammy performance, believes the song is addressed to him.[204][205] Lefsetz had previously been a supporter of the singer's career,[206] and Swift and Lefsetz had corresponded occasionally by email and telephone.[204] Time felt she "delivered her comeback on-key and with a vengeance"[207] while USA Today remarked that the criticism in 2010 seemed to have "made her a better songwriter and live performer".[208] Swift was named Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association in both 2010 and 2011.[209][210] Swift won various other awards for Speak Now. She was named Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music in both 2011 and 2012[211] and was named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association in 2011.[212] Swift was the American Music Awards's Artist of the Year in 2011, and Speak Now was named Favorite Country Album.[213] She was also the recipient of three BMI Awards.[214] Billboard named Swift 2011's Woman of the Year.[215] Also that year, Billboard ranked her at number 15 in a list of the Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters 20002011; she was the second highest ranking woman.[216] Swift was ranked second on Rolling Stone's list of the Top 16 "Queen Of Pops" of the decade.[217]Swift contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album in March 2012. "Safe & Sound" was co-written and recorded with The Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett.[218] John Paul White has said working with Swift was "a revelation. She had some great ideas. We had complete freedom. It truly was a collaboration. We brought the melancholy and the darker angle. Taylor was bringing the melody and the chords."[219] Rolling Stone described the song as "Swift's prettiest ballad" and wondered whether the alt-country folk song was "a one-off novelty, a trial balloon cred-move, or the stirrings of a "grown-up" style".[220] Swift and The Civil Wars debuted a live version of the song at the Ryman Auditorium, Nashville in January 2012.[221] It was released as the album's lead single and, as of July 2012, has sold over one million copies in the United States.[222] Swift's second contribution to the album, "Eyes Open", was written solely by the singer and produced by Nathan Chapman.[223] In May 2012, Swift contributed vocals to "Both of Us", a Dr. Luke-produced single from B.o.B's second album Strange Clouds.[224]Swift's fourth studio album, Red, was released in October 2012.[225] She wrote nine of the album's sixteen songs alone; the remaining seven were co-written with Max Martin, Liz Rose, Dan Wilson, Ed Sheeran and Gary Lightbody. Nathan Chapman served as the album's lead producer but Jeff Bhasker, Butch Walker, Jacknife Lee, Dann Huff and Shellback also produced individual tracks. Chapman has said he encouraged Swift "to branch out and to test herself in other situations".[226] She has described the collaborative process as "an apprenticeship" which taught her to "paint with different colors".[226][227] Red examines Swift's attraction to drama-filled relationships; she believes that, since writing the record, such relationships no longer appeal to her.[226] Musically, while there is experimentation with "slick, electronic beats", it is "limited to a handful of tracks sprinkled among more recognisably Swiftian fare".[228] The Guardian described Swift as a "Brnnhilde of a rockstar" and the album as "another chapter in one of the finest fantasies pop music has ever constructed."[229] The New York Times considered it as "a transitional album" in which Swift addresses her sexual life and own culpability in relationships.[230] The Times praised her "sublime" lyrics, particularly those on the "brooding" "All Too Well".[231] Rolling Stone enjoyed "watching Swift find her pony-footing on Great Songwriter Mountain. She often succeeds in joining the Joni/Carole King tradition of stark-relief emotional mapping ... Her self-discovery project is one of the best stories in pop."[232] However, Salon asserted that, "more than the token Serious Female Singer Songwriters (Joni Mitchell, Lucinda Williams, Carole King,) Swift reminds me of masters of quirky pop sincerity like Alex Chilton and Jonathan Richman."[233]As part of the Red promotional campaign, representatives from 72 worldwide radio stations were flown to Nashville during release week for individual interviews with Swift.[234] She also appeared on many television chat shows and performed at award ceremonies in the US, the UK, Germany and Australia.[235] Swift offered exclusive album promotions through Target,[236] Papa John's[234] and Walgreens.[237] She became a spokesmodel for Keds sneakers,[238] released her sophomore Elizabeth Arden fragrance,[239] and continued her partnerships with Covergirl, Sony Electronics and American Greetings, as well as her unofficial brand tie-ins with Ralph Lauren and Shellys.[240] The album's lead single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", was released in August 2012. The song became Swift's first number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, recording the highest ever one-week sales figures for a female artist.[241] Two further singles have been released: "Begin Again" (to country radio) and "I Knew You Were Trouble" (to pop and international radio).[242][243] Red debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21 million copies; this marked the highest opening sales in a decade and made Swift the first female to have two million-selling album openings.[244] The album also topped international sales charts in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Japan, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand.[245] As of November 2012, Red had sold 2.8 million copies worldwide.[246] In her career, as of November 2012, she had sold in excess of 26 million albums and 75 million song downloads.[246] Swift will embark on the first leg of the Red Tour from March to September 2013, which will see her play 62 dates across North America.[247][246]Swift won three MTV Europe Music Awards in 2012, including the honors for Best Female and Best Live Act.[248] She was named Best Female Country Artist at the 2012 American Music Awards.[249] The Nashville Songwriters Association's 2012 Songwriter/Artist Award went to Swift for the fifth year in a row.[250]One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (ne Moehlenkamp), sing.[9] In her youth, Finlay was a recording star in Puerto Rico and performed in operas in Singapore: "She was in The Bartered Bride, The Barber of Seville and musicals like West Side Story".[4] As a very young child, Swift enjoyed Disney movie soundtracks: "My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own".[20][251] Later, her parents exposed her to artists including James Taylor, Simon & Garfunkel and Def Leppard.[252][253] Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child: "We would stay up that whole night before, just practicing different things to say."[254] She also attributes her "fascination with writing and storytelling" to her mother: "When I was little, she would indulge my imagination and tell me stories."[255] Swift enjoyed both reading and writing poetry and was particularly drawn to the works of Shel Silverstein and Dr. Seuss.[4][256] She remains interested "in any writing from a child's perspective" and has cited To Kill a Mockingbird as one of her favorite books.[49]Swift was introduced to country music by "the great female country artists of the '90s ... Shania, Faith, the Dixie Chicks".[70][26] Those three artists "really sealed the deal" for Swift and she became "infatuated with the sound, with the storytelling" of country music.[9][257] Shania Twain was her biggest musical influence: "She was just so strong and so independent and wrote all her own songs".[258] As an artist, Swift has said she "can only aspire to be like her" and, in 2009, she named Twain's Come On Over as her favorite album.[259][260] She has spent time with Twain,[261] who later expressed an interest in writing with the younger singer.[262] Faith Hill was Swift's childhood role model and she tried to copy "everything she said, did, wore".[263][264] She admired Hill for "taking country music to bigger audiences, and her grace in the spotlight".[263] Hill has become a "welcoming and warm presence" in Swift's life since her rise to fame.[263] On one occasion, Hill and her husband Tim McGraw gave Swift the use of their Los Angeles house while she was working in the area.[265] Swift admired the Dixie Chicks's "we don't care what you think" attitude and was inspired by the way they played their own instruments.[4][266] The band's "Cowboy Take Me Away" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.[267] LeAnn Rimes served as another introduction to country music.[4] Swift found it "motivating" to observe another young artist find success.[268] She then began to explore the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton.[4][269] Lynn's "Fist City" is one of Swift's favorite country songs.[4] She has said Parton is "an amazing example to every female songwriter out there ... There's so much about Dolly Parton that every female artist should look to".[264] She respects Kenny Chesney, particularly from "a business standpoint": "He's one of the only artists playing stadiums ... He's always been a huge hero of mine".[263][264] Other mainstream country influences include George Strait,[4] Garth Brooks,[70] Reba McEntire,[270] Alan Jackson,[4] Martina McBride,[271] Tim McGraw[272] and Brad Paisley.[273] Swift also admires alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams,[274] Patty Griffin,[275] Lori McKenna[276] and Bon Iver.[277]Swift has been influenced by many artists outside the country genre.[278] As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson,[279] the Backstreet Boys[280] and Britney Spears; she still has "unwavering devotion" for Spears.[281] In her high school years, Swift listened to emo bands such as Dashboard Confessional,[282] Fall Out Boy,[283] The All-American Rejects,[284] Death Cab for Cutie[285] and Jimmy Eat World.[286] She was also a fan of female singer-songwriters including Michelle Branch,[286] Pink,[287] Alanis Morisette,[288] Ashlee Simpson,[289] Kelly Clarkson,[280] Fefe Dobson[286] and Avril Lavigne.[280] Swift closely followed the musical supervision on the television dramas The O.C. and Grey's Anatomy, downloading "every" song featured.[277][290] She was a fan of hip hop music, particularly the rhyming patterns used by artists such as Eminem: "Country and hip-hop are two of the most honest genres because we just like to sing about our lifestyle ... Pride is something that both country and hip-hop share".[4] Swift also drew inspiration from the catalogues of veteran artists. Tom Petty, she has said, "is on a pedestal for me".[14] She is "obsessed" with Sixties acts like The Shirelles, Doris Troy and The Beach Boys,[196][284] and admires Bon Jovi because "there's just a melodic stickiness to their songs that I've always been drawn to".[196] Influence also came from older female pop rock singers including Pat Benatar,[280][291] Stevie Nicks,[291] Melissa Etheridge,[291] Sarah McLachlan,[288] Sheryl Crow[292] and Shawn Colvin.[293]Swift lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models: "They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers."[294][295][296] McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel "as if I've been let into his heart and his mind": "Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that."[297] She admires Springsteen because he is "so musically relevant after such a long period of time".[298] Swift says of Kristofferson: "He shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out".[299]Neil Young describes Swift as "a great writer": "I like listening to her. I kind of like watching her respond to all the attacks. I like the ways she's defining herself. So I keep my eye on it".[300][301] Kris Kristofferson claims that "she blows me away. It's amazing to me that someone so young is writing such great songs. She's got a great career ahead of her".[302][303] Dolly Parton is "extremely impressed with her, especially with her songwriting .... I'm real impressed with the depth of her sometimes": "She's got the qualities that could last a long time".[304][305] Stevie Nicks believes Swift writes "songs that make the whole world sing, like Neil Diamond or Elton John ... It's women like her who are going to save the music business".[150] Swift has also received songwriting praise from contemporaries including Alicia Keys,[306] Kelly Clarkson[307] and Lady Gaga.[308] Christopher Owens, the songwriter and former frontman of Girls, describes Swift as his "favourite artist out of anybody", and has expressed a desire to work with her.[309][310] The New York Times has noted similarities in the songwriting approach of Owens and Swift.[311] Ryan Adams has said that "every tune of hers is like the one you wait a whole lifetime to write".[312] Lena Dunham, the creator and star of HBO's television series Girls, has described Swift as her "artistic kindred spirit ... the way she uses autobiography in her work and the way she calls out guys who have, you know, fronted on her before. But at the same time there is something sort of affectionate and non-judgmental about her music that I appreciate."[313][314][315]Thematically, The Guardian has noted that Swift was "fantastically good at regarding teenage life with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia" over the course of her first two albums.[316] New York Magazine has remarked that few singer-songwriters have written "great records so explicitly about their teens ... Her nearest antecedent might be sixties-era Brian Wilson, the one true adolescent auteur before she came along".[317] Comparisons have also been drawn with Janis Ian.[294] Fairytale imagery featured on Swift's second album, Fearless. She explored the disconnect "between fairy tales and the reality of love": "We're raised as little girls to think that we're a princess and that Prince Charming is going to sweep us off our feet".[318][319] Her third and fourth albums addressed more adult relationships.[295] In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships ("The Best Day", "Never Grow Up", "Ronan"), friendships ("Fifteen", "Breathe", "22"),[320][321] alienation ("The Outside", "A Place In This World", "Tied Together with a Smile", "Mean") and career ambitions ("Change", "Long Live", "The Lucky One").[322][323] Her defining quality as a songwriter, it has been said, is "a determination to register and hang onto fleeting feelings and impressions, a pre-emptive nostalgia for a present (and sometimes even a future) that she knows will some day be in the past".[324] Swift frequently includes "a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative".[325] The New Yorker has said that her songs, "though they are not subversive, have a certain sophistication ... Sentimental songs are laced with intimations of future disillusionment".[326]Structurally, Slate notes that Swift has "effortless, preternatural mastery of pop conventions: Very few songwriters can build better bridges than she does."[327] Rolling Stone has described her as "a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture".[328] The Village Voice has noted that Swift uses third-verse POV reversals frequently.[325] She has a tendency to use the same images repeatedly. In the words of The Guardian, "she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot".[316] American Songwriter describes Swift as "a great songwriter, who writes with an unmatched and almost unnatural acuity ... Even her earliest material is characterized by thoughtful  perhaps meticulous  word choice and deliberate melodic construction, with nary a lazy rhyme or aimless tune to be found."[329][330] While reviews of Swift's work are "almost uniformly positive", The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary".[294]Swift uses autobiographical detail in her work.[331] Listening to music as a child, she felt confused "when I knew something was going on in someone's personal life and they didn't address it in their music".[332] The New York Times believes that "righting wrongs is Ms. Swift's raison d'tre".[333] In her songs, Swift often addresses the "anonymous crushes of her high school years" and, more recently, fellow celebrities.[333] Entertainment Weekly remarked that Speak Now was sometimes "an exercise in name-that-celebrity Whac-a-Mole".[334] John Mayer, the presumed subject of "Dear John", has said the song "humiliated" him: "I think it's kind of cheap songwriting. I know she's the biggest thing in the world, and I'm not trying to sink anybody's ship, but I think it's abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go, 'Wait till he gets a load of this!'"[335] The Village Voice has downplayed this aspect of Swift's songwriting: "Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic."[336] New York Magazine believes the media scrutiny over her decision to use autobiographical detail "is sexist, inasmuch as its not asked of her male peers": "Its a relief to see Swift, the ur-nice-girl, refuse to give the mea culpa that many journalists she's talked to have sought ... I would hate for her to get shamed into discretion."[337] The singer herself has said that all her songs are not factual[338] and are often based on observations.[339] Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk specifically about song subjects "because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus."[340]Swift's music contains elements of pop, pop rock, country and country-pop.[341][341][342] She self-identifies as a country artist.[343] Rolling Stone asserts that, "she might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days".[344] Swift's own definition of country music "is really pretty simple. It's when someone sings about their life and what they know, from an authentic place ... One guy will write about how he grew up on a farm and fell in love and raised kids on that same farm. Some people sing about how, when they get sad, they go to the bar and drink whiskey. I write songs about how I can't seem to figure out relationships and how I'm fascinated by love".[343] She has said there will be "a huge temptation" to make an alt-country record as her career progresses.[45] The New York Times notes that, "There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country  a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar  but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville."[345] The New Yorker believes she is "considered part of Nashville's country-pop tradition only because she writes narrative songs with melodic clarity and dramatic shapeNashville's stock-in-trade."[346] The Guardian has said that Swift "cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory".[316] Similarly, Rolling Stone has noted that her melodies call to mind "Swedish pop gods Dr. Luke and Max Martin".[328]Swift's voice has been described as "sweet but soft".[347] In studio recordings, the Los Angeles Times identifies Swift's "defining" vocal gesture as "the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy".[163] Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, remarked: "Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough".[348] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously "bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean".[165] Slate, reviewing Speak Now, described Swift as "a technically poor singer": "Though she does vary her phrasing in ways that attempt to mask her limited voice (the way she sneers, "She looks at me like I'm a trend/And she's so over it," on "Better Than Revenge" is especially effective), Swift is still noticeably off-pitch at least once on every song on the album".[349] In a live setting, Swift, according to The Hollywood Reporter, "does her best, but certainly doesn't have the pipes to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Christina Aguilera or Carrie Underwood".[347] Her live vocals have been described as "flat", "thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt".[350][351] However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.[352][353][354] In an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: "I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across".[1][355] Scott Borchetta of Big Machine Records has conceded that Swift is "not the best technical singer" but describes her as the "best communicator that we've got".[356] Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has "put a lot of work" into improving it.[357] It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons.[358][359] She has said that she only feels nervous performing "if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows".[360]Swift has been described as "America's sweetheart" and "a role model".[361][362] She has high Q Score and Davie-Brown Index ratings, reflecting a high level of public awareness (90 percent) and popularity (80 percent) in the United States.[363] The singer considers it her "responsibility" to be conscious of her influence on young fans.[364] A Rolling Stone journalist who profiled Swift in 2009 remarked upon her polite manners: "If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops".[49][365] In 2012, Rolling Stone remarked upon Swift's "ease with glad-handing ... it's not hard to imagine her running for office someday"[366] while The Hollywood Reporter referred to her as "the Best People Person Since Bill Clinton".[367] It has been said that she is "the kind of driven, intensely ambitious person whod thrive regardless of her profession".[368] A 2012 Vogue cover story described Swift as "clever and funny and occasionally downright bawdy" in person.[369] Grantland describes Swift as "dorky" and "openly neurotic in a way you'd never see from a blonde country princess like Faith Hill or Carrie Underwood. She is more like Diane Keaton in Annie Hall: overly gracious and eager to please but full of a nonstop, nervous, fluttering energy".[370]In the early years of her career, Swift's signature look consisted of sundresses and cowboy boots.[371][372] This fashion style is still copied by many of the young fans who attend her concerts.[371][373] At formal events, Swift became known for "sparkly, beaded dresses".[371] Her naturally curly hairstyle is replicated by fans, and Swift has remarked: "I remember straightening my hair because I wanted to be like everybody else, and now the fact that anybody would emulate what I do? It's just funny."[373] She was asked by Vogue to cut bangs for a cover shoot in late 2011, and now straightens her hair.[374] Swift favors retro style and it has been said that she has the look of "a nineteen-thirties movie siren ... red lipstick, thick mascara."[375][376] She was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011.[377] She has named Franoise Hardy, Jane Birkin, Brigitte Bardot, and Audrey Hepburn as her own style inspirations.[378]There has been much media commentary about Swift's reactions when she is recognized at award ceremonies.[379][380] In 2011, The Hollywood Reporter remarked that Swift "seems to be consistently shocked and wonderstruck by each awards win, despite racking up an ever-growing collection of Grammys, CMAs, MTV Moonmen and AMAs".[379] Kristen Wiig parodied Swift's surprised facial expressions during a Saturday Night Live sketch in February 2012.[381] Swift later said she had seen the sketch: "I was laughing the entire time and then I realized that, as I was watching it, I was making the face she was making".[382] At the Academy of Country Music Awards in April 2012, the ceremony's host Blake Shelton joked in his opening monologue that Swift should release a perfume called "I can't believe I smell this good". When Swift later presented Shelton with the Academy's Best Male Vocalist award, "the two faced off, showing each other their ultra-surprised looks".[383][384]The merits of Swift as a feminist have been widely discussed.[385] She has been described by Jezebel as "a feminist's nightmare": "Her image of being good and pure plays right into how much the patriarchy fetishizes virginity, loves purity, and celebrates women who know their place as delicate flowers".[386] A Village Voice music critic, using supporting evidence from Swift's body of work, dismissed such criticisms as "shallow and gross, in that special way that things get gross when you cram shaded and living work through an ideological sieve like you're mechanically separating chicken".[387] It has been said that anti-Swift feminists "criticize Taylor for being repressive and perpetuating a patriarchal virgin/whore dichotomy by being repressive and perpetuating a virgin/whore dichotomy ... When people dismiss the stories that Taylor Swift writes as unrealistic, unfeminist pap or dismiss Taylor Swift herself as a sexist figure  even if we take them at face value, even if we pretend that Taylor Swift is indeed a virgin who thinks having sex is a bad thing and falling in love and having babies is the best experience a girl can have, they're still wrong. They're still wrong to dismiss her. Because by dismissing her, they're saying that those experiences and those beliefs are invalid and girls shouldn't have them  and that if girls do have them, then they're inferior in some way (unfeminist, unintelligent, uncool, whatever) ... It's the opposite of slut-shaming. It's prude-shaming, and it's no better or more enlightened or more feminist than slut-shaming, because it's still shaming."[388]The song "Fifteen" has been the subject of particular scrutiny. It has been said that the song contains a "feminist message" in the lyrics "Back then I swore I was gonna marry him some day, but I realized some bigger dreams of mine" and "In your life, you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team".[389] Feminist critics claim the use of the word "everything" in the lyric "Abigail gave everything she had to a boy, who changed his mind, and we both cried" is a reference to virginity: "Songs like 'Fifteen' dig up the ancient Puritan ideal that girls can only access power by confidently and heterosexually denying access to their pants."[390] However, others interpret "everything" as trust: "Abigail trusted and opened up to a boy for the first time, only to be let down. Maybe that includes sex, maybe it doesn't."[389]When asked by The New York Times in 2010 whether she considered herself a feminist, Swift replied, "I have never really thought about that".[391] In 2012, when again asked her position, she said that she was "raised by parents who brought me up to think if you work as hard as guys, you can go far in life." She added that she hoped her music was empowering to women: "Theres strength when youre baring your emotions."[392] Later that year, Swift told Elle Canada that feminism was something "I have a lot to learn about ... I want to end up really educated about all these really big topics."[393]Swift made her acting debut in a 2009 episode of CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, playing a rebellious teenager.[394] The New York Times noted that the character allowed Swift to be "a little bit naughty, and credibly so".[395] Rolling Stone felt she "held her own" and "does a good job with the script"[396] while the Chicago Tribune said she "acquits herself well".[397] Later that year, Swift both hosted and performed as the musical guest for an episode of Saturday Night Live.[398] Entertainment Weekly described her as "this season's best Saturday Night Live host so far", noting that she "was always up for the challenge, seemed to be having fun, and helped the rest of the cast nail the punchlines". Proving "admirably resilient in a wide variety of sketch roles", "Swift inspired more of a female, girly-in-the-best-sense sensibility in SNL than it's shown since the Tina Fey-Amy Poehler days".[399]Swift made her feature film acting debut in the 2010 ensemble comedy Valentine's Day, playing the ditzy Valley girlfriend of a high school jock.[400] The Los Angeles Times felt the performance suggested "serious comedic potential"[401] while the San Francisco Chronicle found her "very funny".[402] Time remarked that Swift portrayed her character "rather charmingly";[403] The Boston Globe described her as "adorably dorky".[404] Salon asserted that she was "one of the few actors not wasted in "Valentine's Day". Her overgrown-pixie look and odd, widely set eyes lend her a little bit of Marilyn and a little bit of Lucille Ball: She's Taylor-made for comic greatness."[405] However, Variety found her "entirely undirected ... she needs to find a skilled director to tamp her down and channel her obviously abundant energy".[406] The Daily News described her performance as "painfully clunky" while Slant Magazine found her "unwatchable".[407][408] In 2012, Swift voiced the character of Audrey, a tree lover, in the animated film The Lorax.[409]Swift's philanthropic efforts have been recognised by the Do Something Awards,[410] The Giving Back Fund[411] and the Tennessee Disaster Services.[412] In 2012, Michelle Obama presented Swift with The Big Help Award for her "dedication to helping others" and "inspiring others through action".[413] In December 2012, Ethel Kennedy will present Swift with the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights's Ripple of Hope Award because of her "dedication to advocacy at such a young age".[414]Swift is a supporter of arts education. In 2010, she donated $75,000 to Nashville's Hendersonville High School to help refurbish the school auditorium's sound and lighting systems.[415] In 2012, she pledged $4 million to fund the building of a new education center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville.[416] The 7,500-square-foot building is scheduled to open in 2014 and will facilitate new programs and workshops for teenagers and senior citizens.[417][418] The space will include three classrooms and an exhibit space, and will house interactive activities such as a musical petting zoo and a "wet" classroom space to make concert posters and other art projects.[419] Museum officials have decided to name it The Taylor Swift Education Center and the singer will be involved in an advisory capacity.[420] Also in 2012, Swift partnered with textbook rental company Chegg to donate $60,000 to the music departments of six US colleges.[421][422]Swift promotes children's literacy. In 2009, she donated $250,000 to various schools around the country that she had either attended or had other associations with. The money was used to buy books, fund educational programs and help pay teachers' salaries.[423] In 2010, she took part in a live webcast, Read Now! with Taylor Swift, broadcast exclusively in US schools to celebrate Scholastic's Read Every Day campaign.[424][425] In 2011, Swift donated 6,000 Scholastic books to Reading Public Library, Pennsylvania[426] and, in 2012, she donated 14,000 books to Nashville Public Library, Tennessee.[427] Most of the books were placed in circulation; the rest were gifted to children from low-income families, preschools and daycare centers.[427] In 2012, she co-chaired the National Education Association's Read Across America campaign and recorded a PSA encouraging children to read.[428][429] Also in 2012, Swift promoted the "power of reading" in a second live Scholastic webcast, broadcast directly to US classrooms.[430]Throughout her career, Swift has donated money to help victims of natural disasters. In 2008, she donated the proceeds from her merchandise sales at the Country Music Festival to the Red Cross's disaster relief fund.[431] Later that year, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the Iowa flood of 2008.[432] In 2009, Swift supported the Victorian Bushfire Appeal by joining the lineup at Sydney's Sound Relief concert,[433] reportedly making the biggest contribution of any artist to the Australian Red Cross.[434] In 2010, she took part in the Hope for Haiti telethon; she performed and answered phone calls from viewers wishing to donate money.[435] She also recorded a song for the Hope for Haiti Now album.[436] In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, Swift donated $500,000 during a telethon hosted by WSMV.[437] Later that year, she donated $100,000 to help rebuild a playground in Hendersonville, Tennessee which was damaged by floodwater.[438] In 2011, Swift used the final dress rehearsal for the North American leg of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the United States, raising more than $750,000.[439] She also donated $250,000 to Alabama football coach Nick Saban's charity, Nick's Kids, to aid in the tornado relief efforts of West Alabama.[440] In 2012, Swift supported Architecture for Humanity's Restore the Shore MTV telethon in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.[441]Swift opposes LGBT discrimination. Following the 2008 murder of Larry King, she recorded a Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network PSA to combat hate crimes.[442] On the first anniversary of King's death, Swift told Seventeen that her parents taught her "never to judge others based on whom they love, what color their skin is, or their religion".[443] In 2011, the music video for Swift's anti-bullying song "Mean" dealt in part with homophobia in high schools; the video was later nominated for an MTV VMA social activism award.[444][445][446] The New York Times believes she is part of "a new wave of young (and mostly straight) women who are providing the soundtrack for a generation of gay fans coming to terms with their identity in a time of turbulent and confusing cultural messages".[444]The singer is involved with a number of charities which provide services to sick children. In 2008, she donated a pink Chevy pick-up truck to the Victory Junction Gang Camp; the truck is used to transport sick children from the airport to the camp.[447] In 2009, after performing at the BBC Children in Need annual telethon, she donated $20,000 to the cause.[448] In 2011, as the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year, Swift donated $25,000 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Tennessee. This figure was matched by the Academy.[449] In 2012, Swift participated in the Stand Up to Cancer telethon, performing "Ronan", a song she wrote in memory of a four-year-old boy who died of neuroblastoma. The song was made available for digital download, with all proceeds donated to cancer-related charities.[450] Swift has met with many sick fans through the Make-A-Wish Foundation.[451][452][453][454] She has also made private visits to hospitals such as St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Ronald McDonald House.[455][456][457]Swift has encouraged young people to volunteer in their local community as part of Global Youth Service Day[18] and has promoted The @15 Fund, a social change platform underwritten by Best Buy, which gives teenagers the opportunity to direct the company's philanthropy.[458] In 2007, she launched a campaign to protect children from online predators, in partnership with the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police.[459] Also in 2007, she supported an Allstate campaign which promotes safe teenage driving.[460] In 2009, Swift recorded a Sound Matters PSA to make listeners aware of the importance of listening "responsibly".[461] She appeared in a Got Milk? campaign in 2010.[462] Swift has donated auctionable items to a large number of charities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation,[463] the UNICEF Tap Project,[464] Oxfam International,[465] Habitat For Humanity,[466] MusiCares[467] and Feeding America.[468] She has also performed at a number of benefit concerts, including for the Food Bank For New York City,[469] the Reading, Writing & Rhythm Foundation,[470] Christmas for Kids[471] and Shriners Hospitals for Children.[472]Swift's main residence is a duplex penthouse in Midtown Nashville, Tennessee.[1][473] She also maintains a residence in Beverly Hills, California.[474][475] In addition, she owns a house, purchased for her parents' use, in Brentwood, Tennessee.[476][477] According to Forbes's Celebrity 100 list, released annually in the month of May, Swift earned $18million in 2009,[478] $45million in 2010,[479] $45 million in 2011[480] and $57 million in 2012.[481]Swift dated singer Joe Jonas from July to October 2008,[482][483] and actor Taylor Lautner from October to December 2009.[484][485] She was romantically linked to musician John Mayer from late 2009 until early 2010.[486][487][488][489] Swift dated actor Jake Gyllenhaal from October to December 2010.[490][491][492][493][494] On December 9, 2010, Gyllenhaal called the LAPD for assistance, after a large number of photographers followed the couple's car in Los Angeles.[495] Following their break-up, they were seen together in January and February 2011.[496][497] Swift dated Conor Kennedy, the son of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., from July to September 2012.[498][499]On her eighteenth birthday, "the first thing" Swift did was register to vote.[500][501] During the 2008 presidential campaign, she supported the Every Woman Counts campaign, aimed at engaging women in the political process, and was one of many country stars to record a public service announcement for the Vote (For Your) Country campaign.[502] She stated: "I don't think it's my job to try and influence people which way they should vote."[4] Following President Obama's inauguration, she told Rolling Stone that she supported the president: "I've never seen this country so happy about a political decision in my entire time of being alive. I'm so glad this was my first election."[503]In 2010, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush attended the taping of a Swift television special in Kennebunkport, Maine,[504] and later described Swift as "unspoiled" and "very nice".[505] In 2012, Swift was presented with a Kids' Choice Award in recognition of her charitable work by Michelle Obama, who praised her as someone who "has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year old can accomplish".[506] Swift later described the First Lady as "a role model".[507] In a 2012 interview, Swift remarked that, although she tries to keep herself as educated and informed as possible, she doesnt talk about politics because it might influence other people."[508] She has spoken of her interest in American history and has read books about Abraham Lincoln, John Adams, the Founding Fathers and Ellis Island.[509]Swift is a friend of the Kennedy family. "She's a great friend of all of ours," Rory Kennedy has said. "She's awesome and we love her".[510] The singer has spoken of her admiration for Ethel Kennedy[511] and, when asked about her friendship with Swift, Ethel replied, "Oh, she is amazing! Such good company."[512] Rory has said, "There is a mutual admiration society between my mother and Taylor Swift and I just love it! I think it says so much about Taylor she has that ability to connect and cross generations ... She's terrific and such a great role model for young girls, as well as for all women, really... She's just so curious and interested".[512]Swift has been the recipient of six Grammy Awards, eleven American Music Awards, seven Country Music Association Awards, six Academy of Country Music Awards and thirteen BMI Awards. As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association and the Songwriters Hall of Fame.1 Early life2 Music career

Netbooks are a category of small, lightweight, legacy-free, and inexpensive laptop computers.At their inception in late 2007[1] as smaller notebooks optimized for low weight and low cost[2]  netbooks omitted certain features (e.g., the optical drive), featured smaller screens and keyboards, and offered reduced computing power when compared to a full-sized laptop. Over the course of their evolution, netbooks have ranged in size from below 5" screen diagonal[3] to 12".[4] A typical weight is 1 kg (2.2 pounds). Often significantly less expensive than other laptops,[5] by mid-2009, some wireless data carriers began to offer netbooks to users "free of charge", with an extended service contract purchase.[6]In the short period since their appearance, netbooks grew in size and features, and converged with smaller, lighter netbooks and subnotebooks. By August 2009, when comparing a Dell netbook to a Dell notebook, CNET called netbooks "nothing more than smaller, cheaper notebooks," noting, "the specs are so similar that the average shopper would likely be confused as to why one is better than the other," and "the only conclusion is that there really is no distinction between the devices."[7]By 2011, the increasing popularity of tablet computers (particularly the iPad)a different form factor, but with similar computing capabilities and price rangehad led to a decline in netbook sales.[8] At the high end of the performance spectrum, ultra-light portables with a traditional keyboard and display have been revolutionized[citation needed] by the 11.6 MacBook Air, which due to its significantly higher cost, made fewer performance sacrifices.[9][10] Capitalizing on the success of the MacBook Air,[11] Intel promoted ultrabooks as a new high-mobility standard, which has been hailed by some analysts as succeeding where netbooks failed.[12][13][14] As a result of these two developments, netbooks of 2011 have kept price as their only strong point, losing in the design, ease-of-use and portability department to tablets and to ultrabooks in the features and performance field.[15]The origins of the netbook can be traced to the highly popular Toshiba range of Libretto sub-notebooks. The 6" Libretto 20 dates back to early 1996 and weighed only 840g. More recently, Psion's now-discontinued netBook line, the OLPC XO-1 (initially called US$100 laptop) and the Palm Foleo were all small, portable, network-enabled computers.[16][17][18] The generic use of the term "netbook", however, began in 2007 when Asus unveiled the ASUS Eee PC. Originally designed for emerging markets, the 23cm 17cm (9.1in 6.7in) device weighed about 0.9kg (2lb) and featured a 7in (18cm) display, a keyboard approximately 85% the size of a normal keyboard, a solid-state drive and a custom version of Linux with a simplified user interface geared towards netbook use.[17] Following the Eee PC, Everex launched its Linux-based CloudBook; Windows XP and Windows Vista models were also introduced and MSI released the Wind - others soon followed suit.The OLPC project, known for its innovation in producing a durable, cost- and power-efficient netbook for developing countries, is regarded as one of the major factors that led top computer hardware manufacturers to begin creating low-cost netbooks for the consumer market.[19] When the first ASUS Eee PC sold over 300,000 units in four months, companies such as Dell and Acer took note and began producing their own inexpensive netbooks. And while the OLPC XO-1 targets a different audience than do the other manufacturers' netbooks, it appears that OLPC is now facing competition. Developing countries now have a large choice of vendors, from which they can choose which low-cost netbook they prefer.[20]By late 2008, netbooks had begun to take market share away from notebooks.[21] In contrast to earlier, largely failed attempts to establish mini computers as a new class of mainstream personal computing devices built around comparatively expensive platforms requiring proprietary software applications or imposing severe usability limitations, the recent success of netbooks can also be attributed to the fact that PC technology has now matured enough to allow truly cost optimized implementations with enough performance to suit the needs of a majority of PC users. This is illustrated by the fact that typical system performance of a netbook is on the level of a mainstream PC in 2001, at around one quarter of the cost. While this performance level suffices for most of the user needs, it caused an increased interest in resource-efficient applications such as Google's Chrome, and forced Microsoft to extend availability of Windows XP to secure market share. It is estimated that almost thirty times more netbooks were sold in 2008 (11.4 million, 70% of which were in Europe)[22] than in 2007 (400,000).[23] For 2009, sales are expected to jump to 35 million, rising to an estimated 139 million in 2013.[24] This trend is reinforced by the rise of web-based applications as well as mobile networking and, according to Wired Magazine, netbooks are evolving into "super-portable laptops for professionals".[25] The ongoing recession is also helping with the growing sales of netbooks.[26]In Australia, the New South Wales Department of Education and Training, in partnership with Lenovo, are providing Year 9 (high school) students in government high schools with free Lenovo S10e netbooks in 2009, Lenovo Mini 10 netbooks in 2010, Lenovo Edge 11 netbooks in 2011 and a modified Lenovo X130e netbook in 2012, each preloaded with software including Microsoft Office and Adobe Systems' Creative Suite 4. This is provided under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's Digital Education Revolution, or DER. The netbooks run Windows 7 Enterprise. These netbooks are secured with Computrace Lojack for laptops that the police can use to track the device if it is lost or stolen. The NSW DET retains ownership of these netbooks until the student graduates from Year 12, when the student can keep it. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago-Prime Minister Kamla Persad Bisseser - are also providing free HP laptops to form 1 Students (11 year olds) with the same police trackable software as above.Greece is providing all 13 year old students (middle school, or gymnasium, freshmen) and their teachers with free netbooks in 2009[27] through the "Digital Classroom Initiative". Students are given one unique coupon each, with which they redeem the netbook of their choice, up to a 450 price ceiling, in participating shops throughout the country. These netbooks come bundled with localised versions of either Windows XP (or higher) or open source (e.g. Linux) operating systems, wired and wireless networking functionality, antivirus protection, preactivated parental controls, and an educational software package.Microsoft and Intel have tried to "cement" netbooks in the low end of the market to protect mainstream notebook PC sales, because they get lower margins on low-cost models. The companies have limited the specifications of netbooks, but despite this original equipment manufacturers have announced higher-end netbooks models as of March 2009.[28]Ending in 2008 the report was that the typical netbook featured a 1.4kg (3lb) weight, a 9in (23cm) screen, wireless Internet connectivity, Linux or Windows XP, an Intel Atom processor, and a cost of less than $400 US.[29] A mid-2009 newspaper article[30] said that a typical netbook is 1.2kg (2.6lb), $300 US, and has a 10in (25cm) screen, 1 GB of random-access memory, a 160 GB hard disk drive, and a wireless transceiver for both home and a mobile network. Buyers drove the netbook market towards larger screens, which grew from 7in (18cm) in the original Asus Eee PC 700 to 12in (30.5cm) models in the summer of 2009.[31]Having peaked about about 20% of the portable computer market, netbooks started to slightly lose market share (within the category) in early 2010, coinciding with the appearance and success of the iPad.[32] Technology commentator Ross Rubin argued two and a half years later in Engadet that "Netbooks never got any respect. While Steve Jobs rebuked the netbook at the iPad's introduction, the iPad owes a bit of debt to the little laptops. The netbook demonstrated the potential of an inexpensive, portable second computing device, with a screen size of about 10 inches, intended primarily for media consumption and light productivity."[33] Although some manufacturers directly blamed competition from the iPad, some analysts pointed out that larger, fully fledged laptops had entered the price range of netbooks at about the same time.[34]The 11.6-inch MacBook Air, introduced in late 2010, compared favorably to many netbooks in terms of processing power but also ergonomics, at 2.3 pounds being lighter than some 10-inch netbooks, owing in part to the integration of the flash storage chips on the main logic board.[35] It was described as a superlative netbook (or at least as what a netbook should be) by several technology commentators,[36][37][38] even though Apple has never referred to it as such, sometimes describing itin the words of Steve Jobsas "the third kind of notebook."[37] The entry level model had a MSRP of $999,[37] costing significantly more than the average netbook, as much as three or four times more.[33]In 2011 tablet sales overtook netbooks for the first time, and in 2012 netbook sales fell by 25 percent, year-on-year.[39] The sustained decline since 2010 had been most pronounced in the United States and in Western Europe, while Latin America was still showing some modest growth.[40] In December 2011, Dell announced that it was exiting the netbook market.[41] In May 2012, Toshiba announced it was doing the same, at least in the United States.[42] An August 2012 article by John C. Dvorak in PC Magazine claimed that the term "netbook" is "nearly gone from the lexicon already", having been superseded in the market place largely by the more powerful (and MacBook Air inspired) ultrabookdescribed as "a netbook on steroids"and to a lesser extent by tablets.[14] In September 2012 Asus, Acer and MSI announced that they will stop manufacturing 10-inch netbooks.[43] Simultaneously Asus announced they will stop developing all Eee PC products, instead focusing on their mixed tablet-netbook Transformer line.[43]In 1996 Psion started applying for trademarks for a line of netBook products that was later released in 1999.[44] International trademarks were issued (including U.S. Trademark 75,215,401 and Community Trade Mark 000428250) but the models failed to gain popularity[45] and are now discontinued (except for providing accessories, maintenance and support to existing users).[46] Similar marks were recently rejected by the USPTO citing a "likelihood of confusion" under section 2(d).[47][48][49]Despite expert analysis that the mark is "probably generic",[50] Psion Teklogix issued cease and desist letters on 23 December 2008.[51][52][53] This was heavily criticised,[54][55][56] prompting the formation of the "Save the Netbooks" grassroots campaign which worked to reverse the Google AdWords ban, cancel the trademark and encourage continued generic use of the term.[45] While preparing a "Petition for Cancellation" of U.S. Trademark 75,215,401 they revealed[57] that Dell had submitted one day before[58] on the basis of abandonment, genericness and fraud.[59] They later revealed Psion's counter-suit against Intel, filed on 27 February 2009.[60]It was also revealed around the same time that Intel had also sued Psion Teklogix (US & Canada) and Psion (UK) in the Federal Court on similar grounds.[61] In addition to seeking cancellation of the trademark, Intel sought an order enjoining Psion from asserting any trademark rights in the term "netbook", a declarative judgment regarding their use of the term, attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements and "such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper".[62]On June 2, 2009, Psion announced that the suit had been settled out of court. Psion's statement said that the company was withdrawing all of its trademark registrations for the term "Netbook" and that Psion agreed to "waive all its rights against third parties in respect of past, current or future use" of the term.[63]Netbooks typically have less powerful hardware than larger laptop computers and do not include an optical disc drive that larger laptops often have. Some netbooks do not even have a conventional hard drive.[64] Such netbooks use solid-state storage devices instead, as these require less power, are faster, lighter, and generally more shock-resistant, but with much less storage capacity (such as 32, 64, or 128 GB compared to the 100 GB to 2 TB mechanical hard drives typical of many notebooks/laptop computers).All netbooks on the market today support Wi-Fi wireless networking and many can be used on mobile telephone networks with data capability (for example, 3G). Mobile data plans are supplied under contract in the same way as mobile telephones.[65] Some also include ethernet and/or modem ports, for broadband or dial-up Internet access, respectively.Most netbooks, such as those from Asus, BenQ, Dell, Toshiba, Acer use the Intel Atom notebook processor (typically the N270 1.6GHz but also available is the N280 at 1.66GHz, replaced by the N450 series with graphics and memory controller integrated on the chip in early 2010 and running at 1.66GHz), but the x86-compatible VIA Technologies C7 processor is also powering netbooks from many different manufacturers like HP[66] and Samsung.[67] VIA has also designed the Nano, a new x86-64-compatible architecture targeting lower priced, mobile applications like netbooks. Currently, one netbook uses the Nano; the Samsung NC20. Some very low cost netbooks use a System-on-a-chip Vortex86 processor meant for embedded systems, just to be "Windows compatible", but with very low performance. In 2011, AMD launched Fusion netbook processors which are included in Asus Eee PC 1015T and many others.[68][69]Although not officially sanctioned by AMD for this role, a 1.2GHz Athlon 64 model L110 processor, dissipating 13W, was used by at least one companyGatewayto power a 11.6-inch portable (1366x768 screen resolution), described as a netbook by the press.[70] Launched in mid 2009 at $399 in the United States, the LT31 met with reviewers' approval for its performance, being generally recognized as faster than contemporary Atom-based products in the same price range, while having a considerably shorter battery life and still falling short of Intel's Core 2 ULV product line powering more expensive small-factor offerings.[71][72][73][74]The 11.6 inch MacBook Air debuted in late 2010 with a 1.4Ghz Core 2 Duo processor (a 10W part) and a 1366x768 display resolution for its entry level model priced at $999 (with 1.6GHz available as upgrade), which put it "much closer to a fully modern laptop than the small-but-crippled netbooks".[75] One reviewer described it as the "The Mercedes Benz of netbooks".[38]The September 2011 PC Magazine buyer's guide for netbooks observed that other "oversized netbooks" with 11.6 inch screens had appeared on the market, including the HP Pavilion dm1z (MSRP $449) and Lenovo ThinkPad X100e (MSRP $550), both using the AMD Fusion E-350 processor (an 18W part, although this includes the GPU), which was described as "faster than any given Atom processor".[76]By definition netbooks accommodate processors with little processing power. For comparison a common dual-core Core 2 Duo T5600 at 1.83GHz with 2 MB L2 cache used in low-end laptops has a PassMark score of about 1000 points. The following table shows benchmarks for most common netbook CPUs:[77]ARM Holdings designs and licenses microprocessor technology with relatively low power requirements and low cost which would constitute an ideal basis for netbooks. In particular, the recent ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore series of processor cores have been touted by ARM as an alternative platform to x86 for netbooks.[78][79] In June 2009, Nvidia announced a dozen mobile Internet devices running ARM based Tegra SoC's, some of which will be netbooks.[80]Some ARM-based products were advertised as smartbooks, particularly by Qualcomm. Smartbooks promised to deliver features including always on, all-day battery life, 3G connectivity and GPS (all typically found in smartphones) in a laptop-style body with a screen size of 5 to 10inches and a QWERTY keyboard. These systems do not run traditional x86 versions of Microsoft Windows, rather custom Linux operating systems (such as Google's Android or Chrome OS).[81][82] In the end, few such products were ever shipped to market under this branding, like the HP-Compaq Airlife,[83] the Toshiba AC100 (sold as Dynabook AZ in Japan)[84] and the Efika MX.[85] Some of the devices, like the AC100, have been hampered by being sold with a phone-oriented operating system like Android.[86] By the end of 2010, Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs admitted that tablet computers such as the iPad already occupied the niche of the smartbook, so the name was dropped.[83]In 2012, Microsoft announced the Microsoft Surface, a pair of products with a 10.6-inch screen and including a mixture of tablet and netbook features, e.g. a touch screen but also a keyboard.[87][88][89] The thinner "RT" product will use and ARM processor.Some netbooks use MIPS architecture-compatible processors. These include the Skytone Alpha 400,[90] based on an Ingenic system on chip, and the EMTEC Gdium netbook, which uses the 64-bit Loongson processor capable of 400 million instructions per second.[91] While these systems are relatively inexpensive, the processing power of current MIPS implementations usually compares unfavorably with those of x86-implementations as found in current netbooks.[90]As of January 2009, over 90% (96% claimed by Microsoft as of February 2009[92]) of netbooks in the United States were estimated to ship with Windows XP,[93] which Microsoft was later estimated to sell ranging from US$15 to US$35 per netbook.[94][95] Microsoft has extended the availability of Windows XP for ultra-low cost personal computers from June 2008 until June 2010.[96] However, the discounted license costs only applies to reduced size and functionality netbooks, which effectively enables the production of low-cost PCs while preserving the higher margins of mainstream desktops and "value" laptops[97] as well as avoiding increased use of Linux installations on netbooks.[98] Microsoft also has [99] Windows 7 Starter for this class of devices. As of the first quarter of 2009 many netbook models previously announced with Windows XP for the US market were in fact being released with Windows 7 Starter instead, at the same price point previously announced for the Windows XP editions. However, unlike on regular desktops or notebooks that were sold with Vista but included a coupon for 7, users could not get a coupon for 7 Starter if they bought a netbook.[100][101] Windows CE has also been used in netbook applications, due to its reduced feature design, that keeps with the design philosophy of netbooks.[102]Some netbooks have also been sold with Windows Vista (mostly prior to the release of Windows 7).Many netbooks are by default unable to activate Windows in an enterprise environment using a Microsoft Key Management Service (KMS) as they lack System Locked Preinstallation (SLP) capability in their BIOS.[103] The missing feature artificially segments enterprise customers from the lower end Netbook market; some hardware vendors offer an optional SLP-compliant BIOS to enterprise customers at additional cost.As of November 2009[update], customised Linux distributions are estimated to ship on 32% of netbooks worldwide (0.5% claimed Microsoft),[104] making it the second most popular operating system after Windows. As Linux systems normally install software from an Internet software repository, they do not need an optical drive to install software.As of August 2010[update], major netbook manufacturers no longer install or support Linux in the United States. The reason for this change of stance is unclear, although it coincides with the availability of Windows 7 Starter and a strong marketing push for the adoption of this OS in the netbook market. However, companies targeting niche markets, such as System76 and ZaReason, continue to pre-install Linux on the devices they sell.Netbooks have sparked the development of several Linux variants or completely new distributions, which are optimized for small screen use and the limited processing power of the Atom or ARM processors which typically power netbooks. Examples include Ubuntu Netbook Edition, EasyPeasy, Joli OS and MeeGo. Both Joli OS and MeeGo purport to be "social oriented" or social networking operating systems rather than traditional "office work production" operating systems.Google's Android software platform, designed for mobile telephone handsets, has been demonstrated on an ASUS Eee PC and its version of the Linux operating system contains policies for mobile internet devices including the original Asus Eee PC 701.[105] ASUS has allocated engineers to develop an Android-based netbook.[106] Freescale have also announced plans for a low-cost ARM-based netbook design, running Android.[107] In May 2009 a contractor of Dell announced it is porting Adobe Flash Lite to Android for Dell netbooks.[108] Acer announced Android netbooks to be available in Q3/2009.[109]In July 2009, a new project, Android-x86,[110] was created to provide an open source solution for Android on the x86 platform, especially for netbooks.Since the initial work on Android, Google announced a netbook specific operating system, Chrome OS, and future operating system development may be forked into Android for smartphones and similar handhelds, and Chrome OS for traditional keyboard driven machines like netbooks.Google's new Chrome OS is loaded on some netbooks. These are known as Chromebooks.MeeGo is a Linux-based open source operating system project. It was first announced at Mobile World Congress in February 2010 by Intel and Nokia in a joint press conference, with the stated aim being to merge the efforts of Intel's Moblin and Nokia's Maemo former projects into one new common project. It is programmed in C++ and comes from Linux OS Family. It was initially released on 26 May 2010. The latest stable release available is 1.2 released on 19 May 2011. Official website http://www.meego.com/. As of 27 September 2011 development on MeeGo has ceased in favour of the newer project Tizen. Official website http://www.tizen.orgNetbooks have been demonstrated running other operating systems including FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Darwin.[citation needed]The Cloud operating system attempts to capitalize on the minimalist aspect of netbooks. The user interface is limited to a browser application only.Mac OS X has been demonstrated running on various netbooks as a result of the OSx86 project,[111] although this is in violation of the operating system's End User License Agreement.[112] Apple has complained to sites hosting information on how to install OS X onto non-Apple hardware (including Wired and YouTube) who have reacted and removed content in response.[113] One article nicknamed a netbook running OS X a "Hackintosh."A June 2009 NPD study found that 60% of netbook buyers never take their netbooks out of the house.[114]Another NPD study indicated that by September 2009 netbooks accounted for 20% of all portable computer shipments.[115]Special "children's" editions of netbooks have been released under Disney branding; their low cost (less at risk), lack of DVD player (less to break) and smaller keyboards (closer to children's hand sizes) are viewed as significant advantages for that target market. The principal objection to netbooks in this context is the lack of good video performance for streaming online video in current netbooks and a lack of speed with even simple games. Adults browsing for text content are less dependent on video content than small children who cannot read.In addition to education, netbooks have become the tool of choice for the business road warrior. Because of the portability and intermediate size between smartphones and laptops, business travelers are increasingly choosing netbooks. According to Jim Rapoza, Chief Technology Analyst at eWEEK, at least 15% of the crowd at DEMO 09, a show that displays emerging technologies, were using netbooks over laptops, and that number, he says, may well have been higher.[116]Netbooks are a growing trend in education for several reasons. The need to prepare children for 21st century lifestyles, combined with hundreds of new educational tools that can be found online, and a growing emphasis on student centered learning are three of the biggest contributing factors to the rising use of netbook technology in schools.[citation needed] Dell was one of the first to mass produce a ruggedised netbook for the education sector, by having a rubber outlay, touchscreen and network activity light to show the teacher the netbook is online.Netbooks offer several distinct advantages in educational settings. First, their compact size and weight make for an easy fit in student work areas. Similarly, the small size make netbooks easier to transport than heavier, larger sized traditional laptops. In addition, prices ranging from $200$600 dollars mean the affordability of netbooks can be a relief to school budget makers. Despite the small size and price, netbooks are fully capable of accomplishing most school-related tasks, including word processing, presentations, access to the Internet, multimedia playback, and photo management.[117]A smartbook is a concept of a mobile device that falls between smartphones and netbooks, delivering features typically found in smartphones (always on, all-day battery life, 3G connectivity, GPS)[81] in a slightly larger device with a full keyboard. Smartbooks will tend to be designed to work with online applications.[118] Smartbooks are likely to be sold initially through mobile network operators, as mobile phones are today, with a wireless data plan.[119]An Asus Eee PC 1005HA size comparison with a 15.4 inch laptopECS G10IL XP Netbook with a built-in GSM (HSDPA) module (Europe use)ASUS Eee PC 900Acer Aspire OneZelybron Micro NinaLenovo IdeaPad S10Samsung NC20OLPC XO-1Classmate PC1 History2 Trademarks3 Hardware

Autodesk, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that focuses on 3D[2] design software for use in the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media and entertainment industries. The company was founded in 1982 by John Walker, a coauthor of the first versions of the company's flagship CAD software product AutoCAD, and 12 others.[3] Autodesk software has been used in the design of everything from the New York Freedom Tower[4] to Tesla electric cars.[5] Autodesk is headquartered in San Rafael, California and features a gallery of its customers' work[6] in its San Francisco building. In March 2008 Autodesk was named number 25 on Fast Company's list of "The World's 50 Most Innovative Companies."[7] The company is often seen as a bellwether for the broader economy because its software is used in many major global construction projects and the manufacturing of new products.[8]Autodesk became best known for AutoCAD but now develops a broad range of software for design, engineering, and entertainment as well as a line of software for consumers, including Sketchbook, Homestyler, and Pixlr. The company makes educational versions of its software available free to qualified students and faculty through the Autodesk Education Community. Autodesk's digital prototyping software, including Autodesk Inventor and the Autodesk Product Design Suite, are used in the manufacturing industry to visualize, simulate, and analyze real-world performance using a digital model during the design process.[9] The company's Revit line of software for Building Information Modeling is designed to let users explore the planning, construction, and management of a building virtually before it's built.[10]Autodesk also provides digital media creation and management software for film and television visual effects, color grading, and editing as well as animation, game development, and design visualization.[11] Autodesk media and entertainment software has been used to construct scenes in every Academy Award Best Visual Effects winner for the last 16 years.[12]The company has announced plans to transition most of its software into cloud services over the next three years.[13] In 2011, Autodesk was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the fourth consecutive year.[14] The same year, Glassdoor.com listed Autodesk as one of the top 25 companies for work-life balance.[15]The PSEB division develops and manages the product foundation for most Autodesk offerings across multiple markets, including Autodesk's flagship product AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD for Mac, and AutoCAD WS. Autodesk Suites, Subscription and Web Services, which includes Autodesk Cloud, Autodesk Labs, and Global Engineering are also part of PSEB. In what was seen as an unusual step for a maker of high-end business software, Autodesk began offering AutoCAD LT 2012 for Mac through the Apple Mac App Store.[16] Also part of PSEB is the Autodesk Consumer Product Group, which was created in November 2010 to generate interest in 3-D design and foster a new wave of designers who hunger for sophisticated software.[17] The products from the group include 123D, Fluid FX, Homestyler, Pixlr, and SketchBook. Users range from children, students and artists to makers and DIYers.[18]The AEC industry group is headquartered in Waltham, MA in a LEED Platinum building[19] designed and built using Autodesk software.[20] Autodesk's architecture, engineering, and construction solutions include AutoCAD-based design and documentation software such as AutoCAD Architecture (formerly Architectural Desktop), AutoCAD MEP[21] (formerly Autodesk Building Systems), and AutoCAD Civil 3D. Their flagship product for relational Building information modeling is Revit. Revit is available as Revit Architecture, Revit Structure, Revit MEP or an all-in-one product. The AEC division also develops and manages software for the Construction industry, including Buzzsaw, Constructware, and the NavisWorks (acquired 2007) product tools; the Infrastructure industry, including AutoCAD Civil 3D, AutoCAD Map3D, and AutoCAD MapGuide Enterprise; and the Plant industry, including AutoCAD P&ID and AutoCAD Plant 3D. Projects that have used software from the Autodesk AEC division include the NASA Ames building,[22] the San Francisco Bay Bridge,[23] the Shanghai Tower, and New Yorks Freedom Tower.[24]Autodesk's manufacturing industry group is headquartered in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The company's manufacturing software is used in various manufacturing segments, including industrial machinery, electro-mechanical, tool and die, industrial equipment, automotive components, and consumer products. Products include the Autodesk Product Design Suite, Autodesk Factory Design Suite, Autodesk Inventor Suite, Autodesk Inventor Professional Suite, AutoCAD Mechanical, Autodesk Vault, Alias Products and Moldflow.Autodesks media and entertainment solutions are designed for digital media creation, management, and delivery across all disciplines, from film and television visual effects, color grading, and editing to animation, game development, and design visualization. Autodesks Media and Entertainment Division is based in Montreal, Quebec. It was established in 1999 after Autodesk, Inc. acquired Discreet Logic, Inc. and merged its operations with Kinetix. In January 2006, Autodesk acquired Alias, a developer of 3D graphics technology. In October 2008, Autodesk acquired the Softimage brand from Avid. The principal product offerings from the Media and Entertainment Division are the Autodesk Entertainment Creation Suites, which include Maya, Softimage, 3ds Max, Mudbox, Smoke, Flame, and Lustre. These products have won Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects for 16 consecutive years.[25]Much of Avatar's visual effects were created with Autodesk media and entertainment software. Autodesk software enabled Avatar director James Cameron to aim a camera at actors wearing motion-capture suits in a studio and see them as characters in the fictional world of Pandora in the film.[26] Autodesk software also played a role in the visual effects of Alice in Wonderland, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, Inception, Iron Man 2, King Kong, Gladiator, Titanic and other films.[12]In November 2010, Ubisoft announced that Autodesk's 3D gaming technology was used in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.[27]In 2011, Autodesk acquired a cloud-based set of image tools and utilities called Pixlr.[28]From time to time Autodesk discontinues some of the products in their portfolio. Some of Autodesk's "retired" products are listed here:Autodesk's first notable product was AutoCAD, a CAD application designed to run on the systems known as "microcomputers" at the time, including those running the 8-bit CP/M operating system and two of the new 16-bit systems, the Victor 9000 and the IBM Personal Computer (PC). This CAD tool allowed users to create detailed technical drawings, and was affordable to many smaller design, engineering, and architecture companies.Release 2.1 of AutoCAD, released in 1986, included AutoLISP, a built-in Lisp interpreter initially based on XLISP.[29] This opened the door for third party developers to extend AutoCAD's functionality, to address a wide range of vertical markets, strengthening AutoCAD's market penetration.Subsequent to AutoCAD Release 12, the company stopped supporting the Unix environment and the Apple Macintosh platform. After AutoCAD Release 14, first shipped in 1997, Autodesk discontinued development under MS-DOS, and focused exclusively on Microsoft Windows.AutoCAD has grown to become the most widely used CAD program for 2D non-specialized applications.[30] The native file formats written by AutoCAD, DXF and DWG, are also widely used for CAD data interoperability.In the 1990s, with the purchase of Softdesk in 1997, Autodesk started to develop specialty versions of AutoCAD, targeted to broad industry segments, including architecture, civil engineering, and manufacturing. Since the late 1990s, the company has added a number of significant non-AutoCAD-based products, including Revit, a parametric building modeling application (acquired in 2002, from Massachusetts-based Revit Technologies for $133 million), and Inventor, an internally developed parametric mechanical design CAD application.In Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., Autodesk was sued in 2007 by Timothy Vernor, who alleged that he was entitled to sell on eBay "used" copies of AutoCAD software he had obtained at an office liquidation sale from an Autodesk licensee.[31] A federal district judge in Washington State denied Autodesk's initial motion to dismiss in early 2008. In February and March 2009, both sides filed motions for summary judgment addressing the issue whether the First Sale Doctrine applies to previously licensed software.[32] The Court ruled in Vernor's favor, holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a "sale with restrictions on use"[33] giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. The decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the lower court ruling, denying Vernor the right to resale Autodesk software on eBay due to Autodesk's nontransferable licensing restrictions.[34] In October 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling.[35]Autodesk solutions for Digital Prototyping allow designers, manufacturers and engineers to design more sustainably by reducing the amount of physical prototypes required for a project, or eliminating the need for them entirely.The Building Information Modeling (BIM) capabilities of Autodesk software help the architect, engineering and construction (AEC) industry create more sustainable buildings and optimize building performance. Autodesk took Graphisoft's ArchiCAD's earlier Virtual Building concept from 1987 and has continued to develop it as Building Information Modelling since around 2003. Widespread BIM adoption is a more recent phenomenon.[61]Autodesk's Simulation CFD includes a range of CFD modeling and thermal modeling tools for architectural and MEP applications. Common applications for environmental sustainable design include mechanical ventilation, external flow (wind loading), natural ventilation, and occupant comfort. Other energy applications include analysis for building energy, solar load, advanced energy and heating and cooling.[62][63]The Autodesk Clean Tech Partner Program provides design and engineering software to early-stage clean technology companies in North America and Europe, helping to accelerate development of solutions to the worlds most pressing environmental challenges. Each year, Autodesk gives hundreds of clean tech companies $150,000 worth of software to cut start-up costs. Pi Mobility is a clean tech partner of Autodesks. Using digital prototyping software to build the companys bike, it realized one of the frame components could be cut by a half-inch, saving Pi Mobility more than $300,000 in production costs.[64]The Autodesk Sustainability Workshop is a free on-line tutorial that covers sustainable design concepts such as light-weighting and whole systems thinking. These videos instruct viewers how to make sustainable design decisions early in the design process. It is aimed at students, giving them easy access to free digital content that can supplement traditional engineering education.[65]Autodesk introduced C-FACT, an open-source, science-driven approach to setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, which calls for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to be made in proportion to a companys gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike other carbon accounting methods, Autodesks C-FACT measures carbon dioxide emissions that are proportional to a companys global GDP contribution.[66] Autodesk will derive its own targets using this approach through 2020.Through the use of telepresence, Autodesk has reduced its travel by 16 percent in three years as part of its overall carbon emissions reduction strategy.[67]In 2006 Autodesk sponsored a PBS program named e2 Design, which focused on going green in building designs around the world. Narrated by Brad Pitt, viewers learn about the leaders and technologies driving sustainable design.1 Products and solutions

The functionality of this product is largely replaced by Autodesk DWF Composer (versions 1 and 2) later replace by the free Autodesk Design Review. Autodesk has also released a free product called DWG TrueView. This product enables users to view and plot AutoCAD DWG and DXF files, and to publish these same files to the DWF file format.Autodesk Animator Pro (DOS) and Autodesk Animator Studio (Windows) were products designed for cell based animation produced between the early-to-mid 1990s. At the time Autodesk was also advertising an Autodesk Media product similar in description to Macromedia Director but this product was never released to the public.Cyberspace by Autodesk was an early real-time 3D environment capable of producing basic phong shaded walkthroughs of DXF format models in "realtime". No textures were supported, and the system was able to support a maximum DXF model size of around 35 KB.[citation needed] A popular demo model of the Parthenon in Greece was shown around the US in a tour of the portable demo system  complete with virtual reality goggles.On 10 December 1996, Autodesk announced its plan to acquire Softdesk, a developer of architecture, engineering and construction software.[36]On May 6, 1998, Autodesk acquired assets of Genius CAD-Software GmbH related to the mechanical application business for 68 Mio Euro in cash.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (, Fukushima Dai-ichi (pronunciation) genshiryoku hatsudensho jiko?) was a series of equipment failures, nuclear meltdowns, and releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, following the Thoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011.[5][6] It is the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986.[7]The plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At the time of the quake, Reactor 4 had been de-fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance.[8] Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1-3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. However the tsunami following the earthquake quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed. The flooded generators failed, cutting power to the critical pumps that must continuously circulate coolant water through a nuclear reactor for several days in order to keep it from melting down after being shut down. As the pumps stopped, the reactors overheated due to the normal high radioactive decay heat produced in the first few days after nuclear reactor shutdown (smaller amounts of this heat normally continue to be released for years, but are not enough to cause fuel melting).At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown.[9]As the water boiled away and levels in the fuel rod pools dropped, they began to overheat severely, and to melt down. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown.[10][11]In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. As workers struggled to cool and shut down the reactors, several hydrogen-air chemical explosions occurred.[12][13]Concerns about the repeated small explosions, the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the possibility of larger explosions led to a 20km (12mi)-radius evacuation around the plant. During the early days of the accident workers were temporarily evacuated at various times for radiation safety reasons. At the same time, sea water that had been exposed to the melting rods was returned to the sea heated and radioactive in large volumes for several months until recirculating units could be put in place to repeatedly cool and re-use a limited quantity of water for cooling. The earthquake damage and flooding in the wake of the tsunami hindered external assistance. Electrical power was slowly restored for some of the reactors, allowing for automated cooling.[14]Japanese officials initially assessed the accident as Level 4 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) despite the views of other international agencies that it should be higher. The level was later raised to 5 and eventually to 7, the maximum scale value.[15][16] The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts.[17][18][19] On 20 March, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that the plant would be decommissioned once the crisis was over.The Japanese government estimates the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster.[20] Significant amounts of radioactive material have also been released into ground and ocean waters. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 3050km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern,[21] leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. Tokyo officials temporarily recommended that tap water should not be used to prepare food for infants.[22][23] In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released "into the atmosphere in March last year [2011] alone" although it has been said staff may have been told to lie, and give false readings to try and cover up true levels of radiation.[24][25]A few of the plant's workers were severely injured or killed by the disaster conditions resulting from the earthquake. There were no immediate deaths due to direct radiation exposures, but at least six workers have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses. Predicted future cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures in the population living near Fukushima have ranged from none[26] to 100[27] to a non-peer-reviewed "guesstimate"[28] of 1,000.[20] On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether.[29] On July 5, 2012, the parliament appointed The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) submitted its inquiry report to the Japanese parliament,[30] while the government appointed Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company submitted its final report to the Japanese government on July 23, 2012.[31] Tepco admitted for the first time on October 12, 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants.[32][33][34][35]The Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant consists of six light water, boiling water reactors (BWR) designed by General Electric driving electrical generators with a combined power of 4.7 gigawatts, making Fukushima I one of the 25 largest nuclear power stations in the world. Fukushima I was the first GE designed nuclear plant to be constructed and run entirely by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).Unit 1 is a 439 MWe type (BWR3) reactor constructed in July 1967. It commenced commercial electrical production on 26 March 1971.[36] It was designed for a peak ground acceleration of 0.18 g (1.74m/s2) and a response spectrum based on the 1952 Kern County earthquake.[37] Units 2 and 3 are both 784 MWe type BWR-4 reactors, Unit 2 commenced operating in July 1974 and Unit 3 in March 1976. The earthquake design basis for all units ranged from 0.42 g (4.12m/s2) to 0.46 g (4.52m/s2).[38][39] All units were inspected after the 1978 Miyagi earthquake when the ground acceleration was 0.125 g (1.22m/s2) for 30 seconds, but no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was discovered.[37]Units 15 have a Mark 1 type (light bulb torus) containment structure, Unit 6 has Mark 2 type (over/under) containment structure.[37] From September 2010, Unit 3 has been partially fuelled by mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel.[40]At the time of the accident, the units and central storage facility contained the following numbers of fuel assemblies:[41]Power reactors work by splitting atoms, typically uranium, in a chain reaction. The reactor continues to generate heat after the chain reaction is stopped because of the radioactive decay of unstable isotopes, fission products, created by this process. This decay of unstable isotopes, and the decay heat that results, cannot be stopped.[43][44] Immediately after shutdown, this decay heat amounts to approximately 6% of full thermal heat production of the reactor.[43] The decay heat in the reactor core decreases over several days before reaching cold shutdown levels.[45] Nuclear fuel rods that have reached cold shutdown temperatures typically require another several years of water cooling in a spent fuel pool before decay heat production reduces to the point that they can be safely transferred to dry storage casks.[46]To safely remove this decay heat, reactor operators must continue to circulate cooling water over fuel rods in the reactor core and spent fuel pond.[43][47] In the reactor core, circulation is accomplished by use of high pressure systems that pump water through the reactor pressure vessel and into heat exchangers. These systems transfer heat to a secondary heat exchanger via the essential service water system, taking away the heat which is pumped out to the sea or site cooling towers.[48]To circulate cooling water when the reactor is shut down and not producing electricity, cooling pumps can be powered by other units on-site, by other units off-site through the grid, or by diesel generators.[47][49] In addition, boiling water reactors have steam-turbine driven emergency core cooling systems that can be directly operated by steam still being produced after a reactor shutdown, which can inject water directly into the reactor.[50] Steam turbines results in less dependence on emergency generators, but steam turbines only operate so long as the reactor is producing steam. Some electrical power, provided by batteries, is needed to operate the valves and monitoring systems.If the water in the Unit 4 spent fuel pool had been heated to boiling temperature, the decay heat has the capacity to boil off about 70 tonnes of water per day (12 gallons per minute), which puts the requirement for cooling water in context.[51] On 16 April 2011, TEPCO declared that Reactors 14's cooling systems were beyond repair and would have to be replaced.[52]The reason that cooling is so essential for a nuclear reactor, is that many of the internal components and fuel assembly cladding is made from zircaloy. At normal operating temperatures (of approximately 300 degrees Celsius), zircaloy is inert. However, when heated to above 500 degrees celsius in the presence of steam,[53] zircaloy undergoes an exothermic reaction where the zircaloy oxidises, and produces free hydrogen gas. The reaction between the zirconium cladding and the fuel can also lower the melting point of the fuel and thus speed up a core melt.[54]The reactor's emergency diesel generators and DC batteries, crucial components in powering the reactors' cooling systems in the event of a power loss, were located in the basements of the reactor turbine buildings. The reactor design plans provided by General Electric specified placing the generators and batteries in that location, but mid-level engineers working on the construction of the plant were concerned that this made the back-up power systems vulnerable to flooding. TEPCO elected to strictly follow General Electric's design in the construction of the reactors.[55]On 27 February 2012, NISA ordered TEPCO to report by 12 March 2012 regarding its reasoning in changing the layout for the piping for an emergency cooling system. These changes were made from the plans originally registered in 1966, before construction of the reactor began.In the original papers submitted  in July 1966  for government approval of the plans to set up the reactor, the piping systems for two units in the isolation condenser were separated from each other. But in the application for the construction plan of the reactor  submitted in October 1967  the piping layout was changed by TEPCO, and the two piping systems were connected outside the reactor. The changes were not reported in violation of all legal regulations.[56]After the plant was hit by the tsunami, the isolation condenser should have taken over the function of the ordinary cooling pumps, by condensing the steam from the pressure vessel into water to be used for cooling the reactor. But the condenser did not function properly, and TEPCO could not confirm whether a valve was opened.The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex was central to a falsified-records scandal that led to the departure of a number of senior executives of TEPCO. It also led to disclosures of previously unreported problems at the plant,[57] although testimony by Dale Bridenbaugh, a lead GE designer, purports that General Electric was warned of major design flaws in 1976, resulting in the resignations of several designers who protested GE's negligence.[58][59][60]In 2002, TEPCO admitted it had falsified safety records at the No. 1 reactor at Fukushima Daiichi. As a result of the scandal and a fuel leak at Fukushima Daini, the company had to shut down all of its 17 nuclear reactors to take responsibility.[61] A power board distributing electricity to a reactor's temperature control valves was not examined for 11 years. Inspections did not cover devices related to cooling systems, such as water pump motors and diesel generators.[62]On 30 October 1991, one of two backup generators of reactor nr. 1 did fail, after it was flooded in the basement of the reactor buildings. Seawater used for the cooling of the reactor was leaking into the turbine-building from a corroded pipe at a rate of 20 cubic meters per hour. This was told by former TEPCO employees to the Japan Broadcasting Corporation news-service in December 2011. An engineer told, that he informed his superiors about this accident, and that he mentioned the possibility that a tsunami could inflict damage to the generators in the turbine-buildings near the sea. After this, TEPCO did not move the generators to higher grounds, but instead, TEPCO installed doors to prevent water leaking into the generator rooms. The Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission commented that it would revise the safety guidelines for designing nuclear plants and would enforce the installation of additional power sources. On 29 December 2011, TEPCO admitted all these facts: its report mentioned, that the emergency power system room was flooded through a door and some holes for cables, but the power supply to the reactor was not cut off by the flooding, and the reactor was stopped for one day. One of the two power sources was completely submerged, but its drive mechanism had remained unaffected.[63][64][65]In March 2006, the Japanese government opposed a court order to close a nuclear plant in the west part of the country over doubts about its ability to withstand an earthquake. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency believed it was "safe" and that "all safety analyses were appropriately conducted".[66]In 2007, TEPCO did set up a department to supervise all its nuclear facilities, and until June 2011 its chairman was Masao Yoshida, the chief of the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. An in-house study in 2008 pointed out that there was an immediate need to improve the protection of the power station from flooding by seawater. This study mentioned the possibility of tsunami-waves up to 10.2 meters. Officials of the department at the company's headquarters insisted that such a risk was unrealistic and did not take the prediction seriously.[67]In addition to concerns from within Japan, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also expressed concern about the ability of Japan's nuclear plants to withstand seismic activity. At a meeting of the G8's Nuclear Safety and Security Group, held in Tokyo in 2008, an IAEA expert warned that a strong earthquake with a magnitude above 7.0 could pose a "serious problem" for Japan's nuclear power stations.[68]On request of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation, on 2 October 2011, the Japanese Government released a report of TEPCO to NISA. These papers proved that TEPCO was well aware of the possibility that the plant could be hit by a tsunami with waves far higher than the 5.7 meters which the plant was designed to withstand. Simulations done in 2008, based on the destruction caused by the 1896-earthquake in this area, made it clear that waves between 8.4 and 10.2 meters could overflow the plant. Three years later the report was sent to NISA, where it arrived on the 7 March 2011, just 4 days before the plant was hit by the tsunami. Further studies by scientists and an examination of the plant's tsunami resistance measures were not planned by TEPCO before April 2011, and no further actions were planned to deal with this subject before October 2012. TEPCO official Junichi Matsumoto said that the company did not feel the need to take prompt action on the estimates, which were still tentative calculations in the research stage. An official of NISA said that these results should have been made public by TEPCO, and that the firm should have taken measures right away.[69][70]This all was in sharp contrast with the events at the Tkai Nuclear Power Plant where the dike around the plant was raised to 6.1 meters after evaluations showed the possibility of tsunami-waves higher than previously expected. Although the dike was not completely finished at 11 March 2011, the plant was able to ride out the tsunami, even though the external power-sources in Tokai were lost also. With two (of three) functioning sea-water-pumps and the emergency diesel-generator the reactor could be kept safely in cold shutdown.[71]On 26 November, a TEPCO spokesman mentioned that TEPCO would have been better prepared to cope with the tsunami in March 2011, if it had taken the 2008-study more seriously. TEPCO was also willing to use the estimates of renewed study done by a national civil engineering society for its facility management.[67]Nuclear Safety Commission Chairman Haruki Madarame told a parliamentary inquiry in February 2012 that "Japan's atomic safety rules are inferior to global standards and left the country unprepared for the Fukushima nuclear disaster last March". There were flaws in, and lax enforcement of, the safety rules governing Japanese nuclear power companies, and this included insufficient protection against tsunamis.[72]The 9.0 MW Thoku earthquake occurred at 14:46 JST on Friday, 11 March 2011 with epicenter near the island of Honshu.[73] It resulted in maximum ground accelerations of 0.56, 0.52, 0.56 g (5.50, 5.07 and 5.48m/s2) at Units 2, 3 and 5 respectively, above their designed tolerances of 0.45, 0.45 and 0.46 g (4.38, 4.41 and 4.52m/s2), but values within the design tolerances at Units 1, 4 and 6.[39] The Fukushima I facility had not initially been designed for a tsunami of the size that struck the plant,[74][75] nor had the reactors been modified when later concerns were raised in Japan and by the IAEA.[76] When the earthquake occurred, the reactors on Units 1, 2, and 3 were operating, but those on Units 4, 5, and 6 had already been shut down for periodic inspection.[38][77] Units 1, 2 and 3 underwent an automatic shutdown (called SCRAM) when the earthquake struck.[78][79]When the reactors shut down, the plant stopped generating electricity, stopping the normal source of power for the plant.[80] TEPCO reported that one of the two connections to off-site power for Reactors 13 also failed[80] so 13 on-site emergency diesel generators began powering the plant's cooling and control systems.[81] There are two emergency diesel generators for each of the Units 15 and three for Unit 6.[82]The earthquake was followed by a 1315m (4349ft) maximum height tsunami arriving approximately 50 minutes later which topped the plant's 5.7m (19ft) seawall,[83][84][85] flooding the basement of the Turbine Buildings and disabling the emergency diesel generators[86][87] located there[82] at approximately 15:41.[80][88] At this point, TEPCO notified authorities, as required by law, of a "First level emergency".[78] The Fukushima II plant, which was also struck by the tsunami, incorporated design changes which improved its resistance to flooding and it sustained less damage. Generators and related electrical distribution equipment were located in the watertight reactor building, so that power from the grid was being used by midnight.[89] Seawater pumps for cooling were given protection from flooding, and although 3 of 4 failed in the tsunami, they were able to be restored to operation.[90]In the late 1990s, three additional backup generators for reactors Nos. 2 and 4 were placed in new buildings located higher on the hillside, to comply with new regulatory requirements. All six reactors were given access to these generators, but the switching stations that sent power from these backup generators to the reactors' cooling systems for Units 1 through 5 were still in the poorly protected turbine buildings. All three of the generators added in the late 1990s were operational after the tsunami. If the switching stations had been moved to inside the reactor buildings or to other flood-proof locations, power would have been provided by these generators to the reactors' cooling systems.[91]After the diesel generators located in the turbine buildings failed, emergency power for control systems was supplied by batteries that were designed to last about eight hours.[92] Further batteries and mobile generators were dispatched to the site, delayed by poor road conditions with the first not arriving until 21:00 JST 11 March,[81][93] almost six hours after the tsunami struck.Attempts to connect portable generating equipment to power water pumps were eventually discontinued after numerous attempts, as the connection point in the Turbine Hall basement was flooded and because of difficulties finding suitable cables.[86] TEPCO switched its efforts to installing new lines from the grid to the cooling systems.[94] One plant generator at Unit 6 was restored to operation on 17 March, and external power returned to Units 5 and 6, on 20 March, allowing cooling equipment to be restarted.[95]F. Tanabe has estimated that the core contained the following materials:[96]On 11 March at 14:46 JST, Unit 1 scrammed (shut off power-producing nuclear fission chain reactions) successfully in response to the earthquake[80] though evacuated workers reported violent shaking and burst pipes within the reactor building.[97] At 15:37, all generated electrical power was lost following the tsunami leaving only emergency batteries, able to run some of the monitoring and control systems. It was later learned that Unit 1's batteries were damaged and unavailable following the tsunami. At 15:42, TEPCO declared a "Nuclear Emergency Situation" for Units 1 and 2 because "reactor water coolant injection could not be confirmed for the emergency core cooling systems."[80] The alert was temporarily cleared when water level monitoring was restored for Unit 1 but it was reinstated at 17:07 JST.[80] Potentially radioactive steam was released from the primary circuit into the secondary containment area to reduce mounting pressure.[98]After the loss of site power and reactor shutdown, Unit 1 was initially cooled using the isolation condenser system. About 10 minutes after the earthquake, TEPCO operators removed both of Unit 1's isolation condensers from service, and instead chose to activate the HPCI (High Pressure Coolant Injection) systems to cool the reactor and the core spray system was activated at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool. The core spray system was disabled with AC power loss at 15:37 (The tsunami) and the HPCI system failed following DC (i.e., battery back up) power loss.[citation needed]Operators were unable to restart the isolation condensers for an extended period of time after the tsunami (greater than 30 minutes). After that, the isolation condensers were operated intermittently, for unknown reasons. The isolation condensers were designed to successfully cool Unit 1 for at least 8 hours, and it is unknown how effective they were. After that, refill would have been required to the isolation condenser tanks which are under atmospheric pressure (low pumping head requirements). By design, isolation condensers would have removed the heat from the reactor transferring it out of the primary containment and into the atmosphere, but with limited and non-existent operation, core and containment cooling was not successful.For whatever reason, the isolation condensor apparently did not work. On 27 February 2012 NISA ordered TEPCO to reveal  before 12 March 2012  why the layout of the isolation condensor was changed. In the papers of the original application (dated from July 1966) for reactor 1 the tubes were separated from each other. But in the blueprints submitted in October 1967, the two tubes were connected with each other outside the reactor vessel. TEPCO apparently changed the design without notifying NISA, in violation of legal procedure.[56]By midnight, water levels in the reactor were falling and TEPCO gave warnings of the possibility of radioactive releases.[99] In the early hours of 12 March, TEPCO reported that radiation levels were rising in the turbine building for Unit 1[100] and that it was considering venting some of the mounting pressure into the atmosphere, which could result in the release of some radioactivity.[101] Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano stated later in the morning the amount of potential radiation would be small and that the prevailing winds were blowing out to sea.[102] At 02:00 JST, the pressure inside the reactor containment was reported to be 600 kPa (6 bar or 87 psi), 200 kPa higher than under normal conditions.[87] At 05:30 JST, the pressure inside Reactor 1 was reported to be 2.1 times normal levels, 820 kPa.[103] Isolation cooling ceased to operate between midnight and 11:00 JST 12 March, at which point TEPCO started relieving pressure and injecting water.[104] One employee working inside Unit 1 at this time received a radiation dose of 106 mSv and was later sent to a hospital to have his condition assessed.[105]Rising heat within the containment area led to increasing pressure. Electricity was needed for both the cooling water pumps and ventilation fans used to drive gases through heat exchangers within the containment.[106] Releasing gases from the reactor is necessary if pressure becomes too high and has the benefit of cooling the reactor as water boils off, but this also means cooling water is being lost, and must be replaced if the water level is not to fall too low.[86] If there is no damage to the fuel elements, water and water vapor from inside the reactor should be only slightly radioactive.In a press release on 12 March at 07:00 JST, TEPCO stated, "Measurement of radioactive material (iodine-131, etc.) by monitoring car indicates increasing value compared to normal level. One of the monitoring posts is also indicating higher than normal level."[107] Dose rates recorded on the main gate rose from 69 nGy/h (for gamma radiation, equivalent to 69 nSv/h) at 04:00 JST, 12 March, to 866 nGy/h 40 minutes later, before hitting a peak of 0.3855 mSv/h at 10:30 JST.[107][108][109][110] At 13:30 JST, workers detected radioactive caesium-137 and iodine-131 near Reactor 1,[3] which indicated some of the core's fuel had been damaged.[111] Cooling water levels had fallen so much that parts of the nuclear fuel rods were exposed and partial melting might have occurred.[112][113] Radiation levels at the site boundary exceeded the regulatory limits.[114]On 14 March, radiation levels had continued to increase on the premises, measuring at 02:20 an intensity of 0.751 mSv/h on one location and at 02:40 an intensity of 0.650 mSv/h at another location on the premises.[115] On 16 March, the maximum readings peaked at 10.850 mSv/h.[116]At 07:00 JST on 12 March, Prime Minister Naoto Kan asked Daiichi director Masao Yoshida why his workers were not opening the valves to release rising steam pressure within the reactor. Yoshida answered that they could not open the electrical valves because of the power failure and the radiation was too high to send workers to manually open the valves. Nevertheless, with the pressure and temperatures continuing to rise, at 09:15, TEPCO sent workers to begin manually opening the valves. The high radiation slowed the work and the valves were not opened until 14:30.[117]At 15:36 JST on 12 March, there was an explosion in the reactor building at Unit 1. The side walls of the upper level were blown away, leaving in place only the vertical steel framed gridworks. The roof collapsed, covering the floor and some machinery on the south side. The walls were relatively intact compared to later explosions at Units 3 and 4.[118][119] Video of the explosion shows that it was primarily directed sideways.[120]The roof of the building was designed to provide ordinary weather protection for the areas inside, not to withstand the high pressure of an explosion. In the Fukushima I reactors the primary containment consists of "drywell" and "wetwell" concrete structures below the top level, immediately surrounding the reactor pressure vessel. The secondary containment includes the top floor with water-filled pools for storing fresh or irradiated fuel and for storage of irradiated tools and structures.[103][121]Experts soon agreed that the cause was a hydrogen explosion.[122][123][124] Almost certainly the hydrogen was formed inside the reactor vessel[122] because of falling water levels exposing zircaloy structures/fuel assembly cladding, which then reacted with steam and produced hydrogen,[125] with the hydrogen subsequently vented into the containment building.[122] when the hydrogen reached ignition concentration in the air of the secondary containment building, an ignition source such as a spark triggered a hydrogen-oxygen explosion, blowing out the walls of this building from the inside.Officials indicated that reactor primary containment (the reactor pressure vessel) had remained intact and that there had been no large leaks of radioactive material,[103][122] although an increase in radiation levels was confirmed following the explosion.[126][127] The report[128] of the fact-finding commission states that "There is a possibility that the bottom of the RPV [reactor pressure vessel] was damaged and some of the fuel might have dropped and accumulated on the D/W [dry well] floor (lower pedestal)." The Fukushima prefectural government reported radiation dose rates at the plant reaching 1.015 mSv/h.[129] The IAEA stated on 13 March that four workers had been injured by the explosion at the Unit 1 reactor, and that three injuries were reported in other incidents at the site. They also reported one worker was exposed to higher-than-normal radiation levels but the level fell below their guidance for emergency situations.[130]At 20:05 JST on 12 March, the Japanese government ordered seawater to be injected into Unit 1 in a new effort to cool the reactor core.[131] The treatment had been held as a last resort since it ruins the reactor.[132] TEPCO started seawater cooling at 20:20, adding boric acid as a neutron absorber to prevent a criticality accident.[133][134] The water would take five to ten hours to fill the reactor core, after which the reactor would cool down in around ten days.[122] The injection of seawater into the reactor pressure vessel was done by fire department trucks.[135][136][137] At 01:10 JST on 14 March, injection of seawater was halted for two hours because all available water in the plant pools had run out (similarly, feed to Unit 3 was halted).[135] NISA news reports stated 70% of the fuel rods had been damaged when uncovered.[138]On 12 March, a new electrical distribution panel was installed in an office adjacent to Unit 1 to supply power via Unit 2 when it was reconnected to the transmission grid two days later.[136] On 21 March, injection of seawater continued, as did repairs to the control instrumentation.[3] On 23 March, it became possible to inject water into the reactor using the feed water system rather than the fire trucks, raising the flow rate from 2 to 18 m3/h (later reduced to 11m3/h,[139][140] and even further to reduce the build up of contaminated water); on 24 March, electricity was restored to the central operating room.[141]As of 24 March, the spent fuel pool was "thought to be fully or partially exposed", according to CNN.[142] Pressure in the reactor had increased owing to the seawater injection, resulting in steam being vented, later alleviated by reducing the water flow. Temperature increases were also reportedly temporary. TEPCO condensed some of the steam to water in the spent fuel pool.It was estimated[143] that as much as 26 tonnes of sea salt may have accumulated in reactor Unit 1 and twice that amount in Units 2 and 3. As salt clogs cooling pipes and erodes zirconium oxide layer of the fuel rods, switching to the use of freshwater for cooling was a high priority.The use of seawater has the potential to make uranium chemistry more complex; in pure water the hydrogen peroxide formed by the radiolysis of water can react with uranium dioxide to form a solid peroxide mineral known as studtite. According to Navrotsky et al. this mineral has been found in the fuel storage pond at the plutonium production site at Hanford. Navrotsky et al. report that when alkali metal ions are present, uranium can form nanoparticles (U60 clusters) which may be more mobile than the solid studtite.[144] A review of the research done at the University of Notre Dame on the subject of nanoscale actinyl clusters was published in 2010.[145]By 24 March, electrical power (initially from temporary sources, but off-site power used from 3 April) was being restored to parts of the unit, with the Main Control Room lighting being restored.[146]On 25 March, fresh water became available again to be added to the reactor instead of salt water,[147] while work continued to repair the unit's cooling systems.[148] A volume of 1890 m3 (500,000 USgal) of fresh water was brought to the plant by a barge provided by the US Navy.[149] On 29 March, the fire trucks which had been used to inject water into the reactor were replaced by electrical pumps.[141]On 28 March, pumping began to remove water contaminated with radioactive 137Cs and 131I from basement areas, storing it in the condenser system.[141] By 29 March, pumping was halted because condensate reservoirs were almost full and plans were being considered to transfer water to the suppression pool surge tanks.[150]On 7 April, TEPCO began injecting nitrogen into the containment vessel, which was expected to reduce the likelihood of further hydrogen explosions.[151] The injection has been ongoing since then and has been repeated on the other units at Fukushima.[152] On 7 April, before a large aftershock, temperatures in the reactor core unexpectedly "surged in temperature to 260 C"; the cause was unknown, but the temperature dropped to 246 C by 8 April.[153] On 27 April, TEPCO revised its estimate of damaged fuel in Unit 1 from 55% to 70%.[154]On 17 April, remote control robot was used to enter the Reactor Building and performed a series of inspections, which confirmed on 29 April that there was no significant water leakage coming from the containment vessel.[146]On 23 and 26 April, concerns that Unit 1 fuel rods may be exposed to air caused TEPCO to consider filling the "containment vessel with water to cool the reactor" despite concerns for building integrity.[155][156] Efforts were slowed by Unit 1 radiation measurements "as high as 1,120 mSv/hr".[157] On 13 May, TEPCO announced it would proceed with a plan to fill the containment vessel despite the possibility of holes caused by melting fuel elements in the pressure vessel.[157][158] TEPCO had expected to increase the amount of water pumped to Unit 1 to compensate for any leakage from the holes[159] but decided on 15 May to abandon the plan after finding the Unit 1 basement was already half flooded.[160]On 5 May, ventilation systems were installed in the Reactor Building, to clean the highly radioactive air encapsulated in it.[146]On 12 May, the water level gauge for the reactor was calibrated, and it was subsequently identified that the water level was lower than previously thought (as the water level went off the lower side of the gauge).[146]On 13 May, preparatory work started on the installation of the Reactor Building covers. Construction work started on 28 June.[161]On 20 May, staff entered the Reactor Building, confirming reactor water level and radioactivity.[161]Since 2 July, the reactor has been cooled using fresh water from the on-site water treatment plant.[161]On 21 August, TEPCO reported that all of the temperature sensors of Unit 1 were recording temperatures less than 100 degrees Celsius on Friday 19 August. Once other goals are met, Unit 1 will have achieved cold shutdown state.[162]On 28 October, TEPCO reported the completion of cover construction at reactor building of Unit 1 of Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station.[163]On 19 January 2012, the interior of the primary containment vessel of reactor 2 was inspected, by TEPCO for the first time after the accident, with an industrial endoscope. With this device photos were taken and the temperature was measured at this spot and from the cooling-water inside, in an attempt to calibrate the existing temperature-measurements that could have an error margin of 20C (36F). The procedure lasted 70 minutes.[164] The photos showed parts of the walls and pipes inside the containment vessel, but they were unclear and blurred, most likely due to water vapors and the radiation inside. According to TEPCO the photos showed no serious damage. The temperature measured inside was 44.7 C (112.5F) and did not differ much from the 42.6 C (108.7F) measured outside the vessel.[165]Reports of 13 observations of neutron beams 1.5km "southwest of the plant's No. 1 and 2 reactors" from 13 to 16 March raised the possibility that nuclear chain reactions could have occurred after the initial SCRAMing of the reactors at Fukushima Daiichi.[166] 16 March reports that fuel rods in the spent fuel pool at Unit 4 could have been exposed to air appeared to indicate that uncontrolled fission may have occurred in that fuel pool.[167] Later reports of exceptionally high iodine-134 levels appeared to confirm this theory because very high levels of iodine-134 would be indicative of criticality.[168] The same report also showed high measurements of chlorine-38,[169] which some nuclear experts used to calculate that self-propagating fission must be occurring in Unit 1.[170][171] Despite TEPCO suggesting the iodine-134 report was inaccurate, the IAEA appeared to accept the chlorine-based analysis as a valid theory suggesting criticality when it stated at a press conference that "melted fuel in the No. 1 reactor building may be causing isolated, uncontrolled nuclear chain reactions".[172] TEPCO confirmed its concern about the accuracy of the high iodine and chlorine report by formally retracting the report on 21 April,[173] which eliminated both the exceptionally high iodine-134 and chlorine-38 levels as proof of criticality. TEPCO did not appear to comment on the criticality concern when withdrawing its report,[174][175] but the IAEA has not withdrawn its comments, and some off-site experts find the currently measured iodine-134 levels higher than expected.[176][177]On 12 May, TEPCO engineers confirmed that a meltdown occurred, with molten fuel having fallen to the bottom of the reactor's pressure vessel, or RPV.[178] The utility said that fuel rods of the No. 1 reactor are fully exposed, with the water level 1 meter (3.3feet) below the base of the fuel assembly. According to a Japanese press report, there are holes in the base of the pressure vessel  these holes were meant for the control-rods. After the fuel had melted, it produced holes in the bottom of the RPV, and then escaped into the containment vessel. In November 2011 TEPCO did not know the shape or porosity of the fuel mass, which is at the bottom of the containment vessel.[179] As a result it is impossible to know exactly how far the fuel mass would have eroded the concrete floor, but TEPCO estimate that no more than 70cm of a 7.6 meter concrete slab was eroded away by the hot fuel. The production of heat and steam in unit 1 has decreased, as suggested by both radioactive decay calculations and photographic evidence (same source from TEPCO).TEPCO estimates the nuclear fuel was exposed to the air less than five hours after the earthquake struck. Fuel rods melted away rapidly as the temperature inside the core reached 2,800C within six hours. In less than 16 hours, the reactor core melted and dropped to the bottom of the pressure vessel, burning a hole through the vessel. By that time, water was pumped into the reactor in an effort to prevent the worst-case scenario  overheating fuel melting its way through the containment and discharging large amounts of radionuclides in the environment.[180] In June the Japanese government confirmed that Unit 1 reactor vessel containment was breached, and pumped cooling water continues to leak months after the disaster.[181]On 11/10/2012, TEPCO released results of the first direct inspections (by remotely operated camera) of conditions in the interior of the Reactor 1 PCV.[182] These suggest that the initial assumptions concerning the behaviour of the fuel mass during the accident may have been incorrect. In particular, the distribution of radiation levels within the PCV, with peak levels being around the bottom head of the RPV, suggest that the majority of the fuel has in fact been retained within the RPV. Radiation levels are also notably lower around the lower parts of the "Drywell", suggesting that fuel had not reached the bottom of the containment vessel, or damaged the concrete floor slab. There is a further issue in that radiation levels within the water inside the containment are markedly higher than those in the reactor basements, suggesting that either there is limited flow from the PCV to the basement, or that substantial dilution is taking place - raising the issue of what is the flow path for the water.From 31 March, additional sea water was added to the spent fuel pool, initially by using a concrete pump. Fresh water was used from 14 May. By 29 May water was able to be injected using a temporary pump and the Spent Fuel Pool Cooling (FPC) line.[146][161]On 10 August, the spent fuel pool was switched from the water-injection system  that functioned some 5 months  to a circulatory cooling system. For the first time since the 11 March disaster, all four damaged reactors at the plant were using circulatory cooling systems with heat-exchangers.[183]Unit 2 was operating at the time of the earthquake and experienced the same controlled initial shutdown as the other units.[103] As with unit 1, the reactor scrammed following the earthquake. The two diesel generators came online and initially all cooling systems were available. Initially the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system was primary cooling the core and at 15:00 operators activated the residual heat removal system main pump and the containment vessel spray pump at 15:07 to cool the suppression pool; all these systems failed following both AC power and DC power loss after the tsunami as the diesel generators and other systems failed when the tsunami overran the plant. The reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system was manually activated by operators at 15:39 following power loss, but by midnight the status of the reactor was unclear; some monitoring equipment was still operating on temporary power.[99] The coolant level was stable and preparations were underway to reduce pressure in the reactor containment vessel should it become necessary, though TEPCO did not state in press releases what these preparations were, and the government had been advised that this might happen.[184] The RCIC was reported by TEPCO to have shut down around 19:00 JST on 12 March, but reported to be operating again as of 09:00 JST 13 March.[185] The pressure reduction of the reactor containment vessel commenced before midnight on 12 March[186] although the IAEA reported that as of 13:15 JST 14 March, that according to information supplied to them, no venting had taken place at the plant.[3] A report in The New York Times suggested that plant officials initially concentrated efforts on a damaged fuel storage pool at Unit 2, diverting attention from problems arising at the other reactors, but that incident was not reported in official press releases.[187] The IAEA reported that on 14 March at 09:30, the RCIC was still operating and that power was being provided by a mobile generator.[3] By midday on 19 March grid power had been connected to the existing transformer at Unit 2 and work continued to connect the transformer to the new distribution panel installed in a nearby building.[188] Outside electricity became available at 15:46 JST on 20 March, but equipment still had to be repaired and reconnected.[136]On 14 March, TEPCO reported the shutdown of the RCIC system presumably due to low reactor pressure. Operators had for days taken measures to prevent the reactor pressure from dropping below the level at which the RCIC can operate to keep it running as long as possible. The system was never designed to be used for an extended period.[189] Fuel rods had been fully exposed for 140 minutes and there was a risk of a core meltdown.[190] Reactor water level indicators were reported to be showing minimum-possible values at 19:30 JST on 14 March.[191]At 22:29 JST, workers had succeeded in refilling half the reactor with water but parts of the rods were still exposed, and technicians could not rule out the possibility that some had melted. It was hoped that holes blown in the walls of reactor building 2 by the earlier blast from Unit 3 would allow the escape of hydrogen vented from the reactor and prevent a similar explosion.[190] At 21:37 JST, the measured dose rates at the gate of the plant reached a maximum of 3.13 mSv/h, which was enough to reach the annual limit for non-nuclear workers in twenty minutes,[190] but had fallen back to 0.326 mSv/h by 22:35.[192]It was believed that around 23:00 JST, the 4 m long fuel rods in the reactor were fully exposed for the second time.[190][193] At 00:30 JST on 15 March, NHK ran a live press conference with TEPCO stating that the water level had sunk under the rods once again and pressure in the vessel was raised. The utility said that the hydrogen explosion at Unit 3 might have caused a glitch in the cooling system of Unit 2: Four out of five water pumps being used to cool the Unit 2 reactor had failed after the explosion at Unit 3. In addition, the last pump had briefly stopped working when its fuel ran out.[194][195] To replenish the water, the contained pressure would have to be lowered first by opening a valve of the vessel. The unit's air flow gauge was accidentally turned off and, with the gauge turned off, flow of water into the reactor was blocked leading to full exposure of the rods. As of 04:11 JST on 15 March, water was being pumped into the reactor of Unit 2 again.[196]At Thursday 23 June Tepco-workers entered the building of reactor 2, to install a provisional gauge for measuring the water level inside the reactor. The original device was damaged in March. Next Saturday 25 June Tepco reported, that it was still not possible to obtain accurate data on the water level and pressure of this reactor. The temperature near the containment vessel is very high, because of this the gauge did not function properly: the water inside the tubes of the gauge was evaporated.[197]It was later revealed that workers were minutes from restoring power to the standby liquid control (SLC) system pumps in unit 2 as a way to inject borated water once the RCIC shut down and had spent hours laying cable from a generator truck to the unit 2 power center when the unit 1 explosion occurred. This damaged the cable preventing this method from being used. It is possible this system could have prevented a complete meltdown as it took hours after the explosion until injection using fire trucks could be started.[198]An explosion was heard after 06:14 JST[199] on 15 March in Unit 2, possibly damaging the pressure-suppression system, which is at the bottom part of the containment vessel.[200][201] The radiation level was reported to exceed the legal limit and the plant's operator started to evacuate all non-essential workers from the plant.[202] Only a minimum crew of 50 men, also referred to as the Fukushima 50, was left at the site.[203] Soon after, radiation equivalent dose rates had risen to 8.2 mSv/h[204] around two hours after the explosion and again down to 2.4 mSv/h, shortly after.[205] Three hours after the explosion, the rates had risen to 11.9 mSv/h.[206]While admitting that the suppression pool at the bottom of the containment vessel had been damaged in the explosion, causing a drop of pressure there, Japanese nuclear authorities emphasized that the containment had not been breached as a result of the explosion and contained no obvious holes.[207] In a news conference on 15 March the director general of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, said that there was a "possibility of core damage" at Unit 2 of less than 5%.[208] Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) stated 33% of the fuel rods were damaged, in news reports the morning of 16 March.[138] On 30 March, NISA reiterated concerns about a possible Unit 2 breach at either the suppression pool, or the reactor vessel.[209] NHK World reported the NISA's concerns as "air may be leaking", very probably through "weakened valves, pipes and openings under the reactors where the control rods are inserted", but that "there is no indication of large cracks or holes in the reactor vessels".[209]On 8 November workers did enter reactor-building no. 4, and inspected the place to determine the cause of the hydrogen-blast on 15 March 2011. They found the 5th floor more severely damaged compared with the 4th floor, where the spent fuel pool was located. The fuel itself was found undamaged. The workers also found a severely damaged air conditioning duct on floor 5. These findings did not support earlier assumptions that the hydrogen in the blast originated from the spent fuel pool of reactor 4, but instead proved that the explosion was caused by hydrogen from the number 3 reactor, after the valves were opened. The hydrogen reached the fifth floor of reactor building 4 through the aforementioned damaged air conditioning duct.[210][211]From 20 March, seawater was added to the spent fuel pool[136] via the Fuel Pool Cooling (FPC) line.[161] Fresh water was used from 29 March.[161]On 31 May, the spent fuel pool was switched from the water-injection system, to a circulatory cooling system.[161]Unit 2 was considered the most likely unit to have a damaged reactor containment vessel, as of 24 March.[142] On 27 March, TEPCO reported measurements of very high radiation levels, over 1000 mSv/h, in the basement of the Unit 2 turbine building, which officials reported was 10 million times higher than what would be found in the water of a normally functioning reactor. Hours into the media frenzy, the company retracted its report and stated that the figures were not credible.[212] "because the level was so high the worker taking the reading had to evacuate before confirming it with a second reading."[213] Shortly following the ensuing wave of media retractions that discredited the report worldwide, TEPCO clarified its initial retraction; the radiation from the pool surface in the basement of the Unit 2 turbine building was found to be "more than 1,000 millisieverts per hour", as originally reported, but the concentration of radioactive substances was 100,000 times higher than usual, not 10 million.[214]At 20:05 JST on 14 March, the Japanese government ordered seawater to be injected into Unit 2 in a new effort to cool the reactor core. The treatment had been held as a last resort since it ruins the reactor. TEPCO started seawater cooling at 16:34.[146] From 26 March, freshwater was used to cool the core.[161]By 26 March 2011, electrical power (initially from temporary sources, off-site power starting 3 April) was restored to parts of the Unit, with the Main Control Room lighting being restored.[161]On 28 March, the Nuclear Safety Commission announced its suspicion that radioactive materials had leaked from Unit 2 into water in trenches connecting Unit 2's buildings, leading TEPCO to reduce the amount of water pumped into the reactor because of fears that the water could leak into the sea.[215] The reduction in water pumping could have raised reactor temperatures.[216]On 27 March, the IAEA reported temperatures at the bottom of the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) at Unit 2 fell to 97 C (206.6 F) from 100 C (212 F) on Saturday. Operators attempted to pump water from the turbine hall basement to the condenser,[217][218] but "both condensers turned out to be full."[219] Therefore, condenser water was first attempted to be pumped to storage tanks, freeing condenser storage for water currently in the basement of Unit 2.[219] The pumps now being used can move 10 to 25 tons of water per hour.[219] On 19 April 2011, TEPCO began transferring excess, radioactive cooling water from the reactor's basement and maintenance tunnels to a waste processing facility.[220]On 18 April, remote control robot was used to enter the Reactor Building and performed a series of inspections.[146]On 18 May, staff entered the Reactor Building for the first time since 15 March.[161]On 11 June, ventilation systems were installed in the Reactor Building, to clean the highly radioactive air encapsulated within the Reactor Building.[161]On 28 June, TEPCO began injecting nitrogen into the containment vessel, which was expected to reduce the likelihood of further hydrogen explosions.[161]Since 2 July, the Reactor has been cooled using fresh water treated by the on site water treatment plant.[161]On 14 September at 11AM (JST) TEPCO began injecting water into the No. 2 reactor using the core spray system piping in addition to the feed water piping already being used as this method seemed to be effective in reducing the temperature in the No. 3 reactor. At that time the temperature at the bottom of the No. 2 reactor was still 114.4 degrees Celsius (237.92 F), compared to the 84.9 C degrees(184.82 F) in the No.1 reactor and the 101.3 C (214.34 F) in the No. 3 reactor. The new method has led to some temperature decrease, but not as significant as the decrease that occurred in the No.3 reactor.[221]After some positive effect was noticed using both the core spray system and feed water piping, TEPCO decided on 16 September to increase the amount of water pumped into the No. 2 reactor by one ton, in an attempt to further lower the temperature in the core, to a total of 7 tons per hour. The same was done for reactor No. 3, where 5 tons were added, bring the total to 12 tons per hour. TEPCO also added that the volume of cooling water into the No. 1 reactor would be increased as necessary.[222]On 21 September 2011, Masanori Naitoh, director in charge of nuclear safety analysis at the Institute of Applied Energy, an expert commenting on the plan to contain the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, mentioned that the interior temperatures of the damaged reactors had to be checked to confirm cold-shutdown. Naitoh said that TEPCO was only measuring temperatures outside the reactors, and that the temperatures inside should be confirmed through simulation to confirm that they had fallen below 100 degrees, and that there were no risks of nuclear reactions recurring.[223]In the first week of February 2012, temperatures inside reactor No. 2 became unstable. On 7 February, the amount of cooling water was increased from 10.5 tons to 13.5 tons per hour. After a slight initial decrease in temperature, sensor readings again showed the temperature rising at some locations in the bottom of the reactor. On 11 February, temperatures rose once again.[224][225][226][227] On 12 February, the temperature rose to 78.3C (172.94F). TEPCO denied the possibility of the core going critical again, because that would produce xenon, which was still below detectable levels. To prevent any possible nuclear criticality, TEPCO planned to dump boric acid into the reactor and to increase the volume of cooling water by 3 tons per hour.[228]Since only one of the temperature-sensors showed fluctuating readings between 70C and 90C, TEPCO and NISA thought this sensor was malfunctioning. The sensor works on the principle of changing resistance between the surface of two different metals as the temperature changes. TEPCO planned measurements on this sensor.[vague] Since the radiation around reactor 2 could make it impossible to place new sensors inside the reactor vessel, the situation would become very serious if the other two sensors inside the reactor were to also fail. After that, it would be impossible to monitor the reactor. Kazuhiko Kudo, a professor of nuclear engineering at the university of Kyushu, Japan commented: "Because we haven't been able to grasp how the nuclear fuel in the cores has been distributed, it's impossible to rule out localized high temperature spots. As the high radiation rules out installing new temperature sensors, if the last two sensors fail, the situation will be much more serious indeed."[229][230][231] On 26 February, TEPCO sent a report to the Japanese government about the malfunctioning temperature-sensors and has since ceased monitoring that sensor. The other two temperature-sensors and the radiation levels inside the containment vessel would be used to monitor the state of the cold shutdown. The amount of cooling water would be lowered, after NISA's approval.[232]On 15 April 2012, one of the two remaining temperature-sensors at the bottom of the No.2 reactor gave false readings, and because the electric resistance was found greatly increased, TEPCO concluded that it was broken, leaving only 18 of 36 temperature sensors still functioning. At 11 a.m., the remaining thermometer at this place measured 46.7 degrees Celsius.[233]On 1 June 2012 TEPCO reported that another thermometer had malfunctioned, resulting in more than half of the temperature sensors, 23 out of 41, now being out of use in reactor No. 2., thus making it more problematic to monitor the state of "cold-shutdown". According to TEPCO, the high humidity in the reactor may be a contributing factor in the failure of the sensors. TEPCO stated that it is currently decontaminating the site and training workers to install new thermometers. The plan is to install new thermometers through pipes that are connected to the reactor. TEPCO stated that it plans to decontaminate the site and install the new thermometers by late July 2012.[234]On 15 June 2012 TEPCO reported that a robot that was sent into the No. 2 reactor building on 13 June 2012 to take video images and radiation measurements, detected a reading of 880mSv (millisieverts) per hour of radiation on the fifth floor, which one floor (4.5 meters) directly above the reactor containment vessel. TEPCO suspects that during initial accident in March 2011, that radioactive substances leaked from the No. 2 reactor moved through the building, but after analyzing the images taken by the robot it could not find the exact route the radioactive substances traveled, and images taken by the robot found no major damage on the fifth floor. During the March 2011 nuclear accident the No. 2 reactor is believed to have released the largest amount of radioactive substances. But the overall route the radioactive material traveled has yet to be determined. TEPCO needs to find and repair the damaged parts of the reactor to recover melted nuclear fuel before TEPCO can begin the process of decommissioning the reactor. However high radiation often stops workers from entering the building. This scenario means it will take a long time to find the problems in the containment vessel.[235]On 3 October 2012 TEPCO installed a new temperature-sensor inside reactor nr.2. The thermometer showed 42.6 degrees Celsius, another nearby the RPV bottom monitoring instrument (TE-2-3-69H3) indicated 46.1 degrees. At that moment only 1 out of the existing 5 sensors was functioning properly.[236] [237]On 15 May, TEPCO revealed that the pressure vessel that holds nuclear fuel "is likely to be damaged and leaking water at Units2 and 3", which means most of the thousands of tons of water pumped into the reactors had leaked.[180]On 29 March, Richard Lahey, former head of safety research for boiling-water reactors at General Electric, speculated that the reactor core may have melted through the reactor containment vessel onto a concrete floor, raising concerns of a major release of radioactive material, while failing to divulge the report by Dale G. Bridenbaugh which condemned the design as "unsafe".[238] On 27 April, TEPCO revised its estimate of damaged fuel in Unit 2 from 30% to 35%.[154] TEPCO reported on 23 May that Reactor 2 suffered a meltdown about 100 hours after the earthquake.[239]On 1 November 2011 TEPCO said that xenon-133 and xenon-135 was detected in gas-samples taken from the containment vessel of reactor 2, in a concentration of 6 to 10 (or more) parts per million becquerels per cubic centimeter. Xenon-135 was also detected in gas samples collected on 2 November. These isotopes are the result of nuclear fission-reaction of uranium. Because the short half-lifes of these gases: (Xe-133: 5 days Xe-135: 9 hours), the presence could only mean that nuclear fissions were occurring at some places in the reactor. Boric-acid was poured into the reactor in an attempt to stop the fission-reactions. No significant change in temperature or pressure was found by TEPCO, so there was no sign of large-scale criticality. The reactor-cooling was continued, but TEPCO would examine the situation at reactor 1 and 3 also.[240][241][242][243] Professor Koji Okamoto of the University of Tokyo Graduate School made the comment that localized and temporary fission might still happen, and that the melted fuel could undergo fission, but the fuel was probably scattered around. Neutrons from radioactive materials could react with the uranium fuel and other substances. Self-sustaining chain reactions were unlikely, thanks to the huge amounts of boric acid that were poured into the reactor. According to Okamoto, these neutrons should be closely monitored to make sure fission did not happen, because when the fission-reactions were not controlled, it would be impossible to reach a state of "cold-shutdown". Therefore it was needed to locate all molten fuel in and outside the reactor-vessel.[241][244]On 3 November 2011 TEPCO said that the tiny amounts of xenon-135 detected in the reactor's containment vessel atmosphere came from spontaneous nuclear fission with curium-242 and curium-244, substances that were present in the nuclear fuel. A critical fission would have caused much higher concentrations of xenon isotopes. These reactions would occur constantly, and did not lead to criticality in the melted fuel of reactor 2. All assessments would be sent to NISA for reevaluation.[245][246][247]The detection of xenon on the afternoon of 1 November by TEPCO was reported to NISA in the night. The next day, 2 November just past 7 a.m., NISA informed the Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda's secretary about the possibility of critical reactions in reactor 2. Two hours later at 9 a.m. prime minister Edano learned the news. At a press-conference, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura revealed that Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yukio Edano sent a strong reprimand to Hiroyuki Fukano, the chief of NISA, because NISA failed to report the incident immediately to both himself and the Prime Minister's Office, and that NISA waited almost a day after the find was done. Fujimura said, "I have been told that NISA decided not to report the incident until the following morning because the agency didn't believe it was a dangerous situation."[248]Unlike the other five reactor units, reactor 3 ran on mixed core, containing both uranium fuel and mixed uranium and plutonium oxide, or MOX fuel (with the core comprising ~6% MOX fuel[250]), during a loss of cooling accident in a subcritical reactor MOX fuel will not behave differently to UOX fuel. The key difference between plutonium-239 and uranium-235 is that plutonium emits fewer delayed neutrons than uranium when it undergoes fission.[251]While water-insoluble forms of plutonium such as plutonium dioxide are very harmful to the lungs, this toxicity is not relevant during a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) because plutonium is very involatile and unlikely to leave the reactor in large amounts. Plutonium dioxide has a very high boiling point. The toxic effect of the plutonium to the public under these conditions is much less than that of iodine-131 and caesium. A key difference between the Fukushima accident and the Chernobyl accident was that the Chernobyl explosion shattered the fuel and flung it out of the reactor building, while at Fukushima there was no steam explosion driven by the release of fission energy. During a loss of cooling accident, the fuel is not subject to such intense mechanical stresses, so the release of radioactivity is controlled by the boiling-point of the different elements present.[252]Following the reactor SCRAM, operators activated the reactor core isolation cooling system (RCIC) and the residual heat removal system and core spray systems were made available to cool the suppression pool; whether they were activated prior to the tsunami has not been made clear. The RHRS and CS pumps were knocked out of commission by the tsunami. With DC battery power remaining, the RCIC continued to keep the water level stable, and the operators switched to the high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system when water level began to drop. On 13 March, the HPCI system failed, the reason for which is not completely clear due to instrumentation not being available. It is believed to be either due to loss of DC power due to depletion of batteries or to reactor pressure dropping below the level at which it can operate. Operators were unable to restart it as batteries were exhausted. After this the operators were unable to start the RCIC system and began injecting seawater. Although it was not clear at the time, some of the fuel in Reactor 3 apparently melted around sixty hours after the earthquake (the night of the 12th to 13th).[239]Early on 13 March an official of the Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) told at a news conference that the emergency cooling system of Unit 3 had failed, spurring an urgent search for a means to supply cooling water to the reactor vessel to prevent a meltdown of its reactor core.[253] At 05:38 there was no means of adding coolant to the reactor, owing to loss of power. Work to restore power and to vent excessive pressure continued.[254] At one point, the top three meters of the uranium/mixed oxide (MOX) fuel rods were not covered by coolant.[255]At 07:30 JST, TEPCO prepared to release radioactive steam, indicating that "the amount of radiation to be released would be small and not of a level that would affect human health"[256] and manual venting took place at 08:41 and 09:20.[257] At 09:25 JST on 13 March, operators began injecting water containing boric acid into the primary containment vessel (PCV) via the pump of a fire truck.[258][259] When water levels continued to fall and pressure to rise, the injected water was switched to seawater at 13:12.[254] By 15:00 it was noted that despite adding water the level in the reactor did not rise and radiation had increased.[260] A rise was eventually recorded but the level stuck at 2 m below the top of reactor core. Other readings suggested that this could not be the case and the gauge was malfunctioning.[257]Injection of seawater into the primary containment vessel (PCV) was discontinued at 01:10 on 14 March because all the water in the reserve pool had been used up. Supplies were restored by 03:20 and injection of water resumed.[259] On the morning of 15 March, Secretary Edano announced that according to TEPCO, at one location near reactor Units 3 and 4, radiation at an equivalent dose rate of 400 mSv/h was detected.[3][261][262] This might have been due to debris from the explosion in Unit 4.[263]At 12:33 JST on 13 March, the chief spokesman of the Japanese government, Yukio Edano said hydrogen gas was building up inside the outer building of Unit 3 just as had occurred in Unit 1, threatening the same kind of explosion.[264] At 11:15 JST on 14 March, the envisaged explosion of the building surrounding Reactor 3 of Fukushima 1 occurred, owing to the ignition of built up hydrogen gas.[265][266] The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency of Japan (NISA) reported, as with Unit 1, the top section of the reactor building was blown apart, but the inner containment vessel was not breached. The explosion was larger than that in Unit 1 and felt 40 kilometers away. Pressure readings within the reactor remained steady at around 380 kPa at 11:13 and 360 kPa at 11:55 compared to nominal levels of 400 kPa and a maximum recorded of 840 kPa. Water injection continued. Dose rates of 0.05 mSv/h were recorded in the service hall and of 0.02 mSv/h at the plant entrance.[267]Eleven people were reported injured in the blast.[268] TEPCO and NISA announced that four TEPCO employees, three subcontractor employees, and four Self-Defence-Force soldiers were injured.[269][270][271] Six military personnel from the Ground Self Defense Force's Central Nuclear Biological Chemical Weapon Defense Unit, led by Colonel Shinji Iwakuma, had just arrived outside the reactor to spray it with water and were exiting their vehicles when the explosion occurred. Iwakuma later said that TEPCO had not informed them that there was a danger of a hydrogen explosion in the reactor, adding, "Tokyo Electric was desperate to stabilize (the plant), so I am not angry at them. If there is a possibility of an explosion, I would be reluctant to send my men there."[272]TEPCO claimed that there was a small but non-zero probability that the exposed fuel assemblies could reach criticality.[273][274] The BBC commented that criticality would never mean a nuclear explosion, but could cause a sustained release of radioactive materials.[273] Criticality is usually considered highly unlikely, owing to the low enrichment level used in light water reactors.[275][276][277] American nuclear engineer Arnold Gundersen, noting the much greater power and vertical debris ejection compared to the Unit 1 hydrogen blast, has theorized that the Unit 3 explosion involved a prompt criticality in the spent fuel pool material, triggered by the mechanical disruption of an initial, smaller hydrogen gas explosion in the building.[278]On 11 May, TEPCO released underwater robotic video from the spent fuel pool. The video appears to show large amounts of debris contaminating the pool. Based on water samples analysed, unnamed experts and TEPCO reported that the fuel rods were left "largely undamaged",[279][280] and that it appears that the Unit 3 explosion was entirely related to hydrogen buildup within the building from venting of the reactor.Around 10:00 JST on 16 March, NHK helicopters flying 30km away videotaped white fumes rising from the Fukushima I facility. Officials suggested that the Reactor 3 building was the most likely source, and said that its containment systems may have been breached.[281] The control room for Reactors 3 and 4 was evacuated at 10:45 JST but staff were cleared to return and resume water injection into the reactor at 11:30 JST.[282] At 16:12 JST, Self Defence Force (SDF) Chinook helicopters were preparing to pour water on Unit 3, where white fumes rising from the building was believed to be water boiling away from the fuel rod cooling pond on the top floor of the reactor building, and on Unit 4 where the cooling pool was also short of water. The mission was cancelled when helicopter measurements reported radiation levels of 50 mSv.[283][284] At 21:06 pm JST, the government reported that major damage to Reactor 3 was unlikely but that it nonetheless remained their highest priority.[285]Early on 17 March, TEPCO requested another attempt by the military to put water on the reactor using a helicopter[286] and four helicopter drops of seawater took place around 10:00 JST.[287] The riot police used a water cannon to spray water onto the top of the reactor building and then were replaced by members of the SDF with spray vehicles. On 18 March, a crew of firemen took over the task with six fire engines each spraying 6 tons of water in 40 minutes. 30 further hyper rescue vehicles were involved in spraying operations.[288] Spraying continued each day to 23 March because of concerns the explosion in Unit 3 may have damaged the pool (total 3,742 tonnes of water sprayed up to 22 March) with changing crews to minimise radiation exposure.[3] Lighting in the control room was restored on 22 March after a connection was made to a new grid power supply and by 24 March it was possible to add 35 tonnes of seawater to the spent fuel pool using the cooling and purification system.[140] On 21 March grey smoke was reported to be rising from the southeast corner of Unit 3  where the spent fuel pool is located. Workers were evacuated from the area. TEPCO claimed no significant change in radiation levels and the smoke subsided later the same day.[289]On 23 March, black smoke billowed from Unit 3, prompting another evacuation of workers from the plant, though Tokyo Electric Power Co. officials said there had been no corresponding spike in radiation at the plant. "We don't know the reason for the smoke", Hidehiko Nishiyama of the Nuclear Safety Agency said.[290]On 24 March, three workers entered the basement of the turbine building and were exposed to radiation when they stepped into contaminated water. Two of them were not wearing high boots and received beta ray burns. They were hospitalized but their injuries were not life-threatening.[291]From 25 March, the source of water being injected into the core was switched from seawater to freshwater.[161]In August, TEPCO began considering changing the core injection method for the no. 3 reactor as it was requiring a much larger quantity of water to cool and the temperatures remained relatively high compared to the nos. 1 and 2 reactors which required far less water. TEPCO has hypothesized that this may be because some fuel is still present above the core support plate inside the pressure vessel of the no. 3 reactor in addition to the fuel that has fallen to the bottom of the pressure vessel. The fuel on the bottom would be easily cooled by the existing method, but as the pressure vessel is leaking, any fuel located on the support plate was likely only being cooled due to the steam generated by the cooling of the melted fuel at the bottom. TEPCO began considering utilizing the reactor's core spray system pipes as an additional path of water injection and then reduce the amount of water through the existing feedwater piping system. A team of workers were sent inside the reactor building to inspect the core spray system pipes and it was found that the piping was undamaged. Hoses were then run from the temporary injection pumps located outside the building and connected to the core spray system piping. On 1 September, TEPCO began injecting water using the new route. The new injection method has been considerably effective in lowering the temperature of the reactor to below 100 degrees celsius. As of 27 September, most of the no. 3 reactor's temperature readings are between 7080 degrees celsius. Later, TEPCO began utilizing the same method in the no. 2 reactor; it has not had as significant effect on the no. 2 reactor as it did on the no. 3.[292]On 25 March 2011, officials announced the reactor vessel might be breached and leaking radioactive material. High radiation levels from contaminated water prevented work.[293] Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) reiterated concerns about a Unit 3 breach on 30 March.[209] NHK World reported the NISA's concerns as "air may be leaking", very probably through "weakened valves, pipes and openings under the reactors where the control rods are inserted", but that "there is no indication of large cracks or holes in the reactor vessels".[209] As with the other reactors, water was transferred from condenser reservoirs to the suppression pool surge tanks so that condensers could be used to hold radioactive water pumped from the basement.[150]On 17 April, remote control robots were used to enter the Reactor Building and performed a series of inspections.[161]On 27 April, TEPCO revised its estimate of damaged fuel in Unit 3 from 25% to 30%.[154] Radiation measurements of the water in the Unit 3 spent fuel pool were reported at 140 kBq of radioactive caesium-134 per cubic centimeter, 150 kBq of caesium-137 per cubic centimeter, and 11 kBq per cubic centimeter of iodine-131 on 10 May.[280]On 15 May, TEPCO revealed that the pressure vessel that holds nuclear fuel "is likely to be damaged and leaking water at Units2 and 3", which means most of the thousands of tons of water pumped into the reactors had leaked.[180]On 23 May, TEPCO reported that Reactor 3 had suffered a meltdown some sixty hours after the earthquake.[239]On 9 June, staff entered the Reactor Building to conduct radiation surveying.[161]On 25 June and the following day boric acid dissolved in 90 tons of water was pumped into the spent fuel pool of Reactor 3. Concrete debris from the March hydrogen explosion of the reactor building have been detected in the spent fuel pool. In June TEPCO discovered that the water in the pool was strongly alkaline: the pH had reached a value of 11.2. Leaching of calcium hydroxide (portlandite) or calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) from the concrete could have caused this. The alkaline water could accelerate the corrosion of the aluminium racks holding the spent fuel rods. If the fuel assemblies would fall, this could lead to re-criticality. In the mean time preparative works began to install a recirculation cooling system at the fuel pool, that should be operational in the first weeks of July.[294]On 14 July, TEPCO began injecting nitrogen into the containment vessel, which was expected to reduce the likelihood of further hydrogen explosions.[161]On 1 July, the spent fuel pool was switched from the water-injection cooling system, to a circulatory cooling system.[161]Since 2 July, the Reactor has been cooled using fresh water treated by the on site water treatment plant.[161]On 11 January 2012, radioactive contaminated water was found in two underground tunnels. On 12 January, TEPCO admitted that around 300 cubic meter water had accummulated in an underground tunnel near reactor No.3, with electric cables. Radioactive caesium was measured in concentrations varying from 49 to 69 becquerels per cubic centimeter. Smaller amounts of contaminated water with lower concentrations caesium was found in a tunnel near reactor no.1. How the water could accumulate at these places was under examination.[295]In a study that began two months after an earthquake and tsunami, scientists say they've found mutant butterflies as a possible reaction to the Fukushima nuclear disaster and that it may be changing life around the area. Some of the butterflies had abnormalities in their legs, antennae, and abdomens, and dents in their eyes, according to the study published in Scientific Reports, an online journal from the team behind Nature Publishing Group.[296]When the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster began on 11 March 2011, reactor unit 4 was shut down and all fuel rods had been transferred to the spent fuel pool on an upper floor of the reactor building. On 15 March, an explosion damaged the fourth floor rooftop area of the unit 4 reactor. Japan's nuclear safety agency NISA reported two large holes in a wall of the outer building of unit 4 after the explosion. It was reported that water in the spent fuel pool might be boiling. Radiation inside the unit 4 control room prevented workers from staying there permanently. Visual inspection of the spent fuel pool of reactor 4 on 30 April showed that there was no significant visible damage to the fuel rods in the pool. A radiochemical examination of the water from the pond confirms that little of the fuel in the pond has been damaged.[297]Reactors 5 and 6 were also not operating when the earthquake struck although, unlike reactor 4, they were still fueled. The reactors have been closely monitored, as cooling processes were not functioning well.[citation needed]In October 2012, the former Japanese Ambassador to both Switzerland and Senegal Mitsuhei Murata said that ground under Fukushima Unit 4 is sinking, and the structure is on the verge of complete collapse.[298][299] Akio Matsumura also believes that the plant is incredibly dangerous to the world.[300]Used fuel assemblies taken from reactors are initially stored for at least 18 months in the pools adjacent to their reactors. They can then be transferred to the central fuel storage pond.[3] This contains 6375 fuel assemblies and was reported "secured" with a temperature of 55 C. After further cooling, fuel can be transferred to dry cask storage, which has shown no signs of abnormalities.[301] On 21 March, temperatures in the fuel pond had risen slightly, to 61 C and water was sprayed over the pool.[3] Power was restored to cooling systems on 24 March and by 28 March temperatures were reported down to 35 C.[141]Government agencies and Tepco were thoroughly unprepared for the "cascading nuclear disaster"[citation needed]. The tsunami that "began the nuclear disaster could and should have been anticipated and that ambiguity about the roles of public and private institutions in such a crisis was a factor in the poor response at Fukushima".[302] In March 2012, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said that the government shared the blame for the Fukushima disaster, saying that officials had been blinded by a false belief in the country's "technological infallibility", and were taken in by a "safety myth". Noda said "Everybody must share the pain of responsibility".[303]According to Naoto Kan, Japan's former prime minister, the country was totally unprepared for the Fukushima disaster, and the crippled Fukushima plant should not have been built so close to the ocean on a tsunami-prone coast.[304] Kan has acknowledged flaws in authorities' handling of the crisis, including poor communication and coordination between nuclear regulators, utility officials and the government. He said the disaster "laid bare a host of an even bigger man-made vulnerabilities in Japan's nuclear industry and regulation, from inadequate safety guidelines to crisis management, all of which he said need to be overhauled".[304]A national program to develop robots for use in nuclear emergencies was terminated in midstream because it "smacked too much of underlying danger". Japan, supposedly a leader in robotics, had none to send in to Fukushima when the crisis began. Similarly, Japans Nuclear Safety Commission said in its safety guidelines for light-water nuclear facilities that "the potential for extended loss of power need not be considered." But just such an extended loss of power contributed to the Fukushima meltdowns.[305]Physicist and environmentalist Amory Lovins has said: Japans "rigid bureaucratic structures, reluctance to send bad news upwards, need to save face, weak development of policy alternatives, eagerness to preserve nuclear powers public acceptance, and politically fragile government, along with TEPCOs very hierarchical management culture, also contributed to the way the accident unfolded. Moreover, the information Japanese people receive about nuclear energy and its alternatives has long been tightly controlled by both TEPCO and the government".[306]At a rally promoting the abandonment of Japan's nuclear program, led by Nobel-winning novelist Kenzburo Oe, pop star Ryuichi Sakamoto, and visual artist Yoshitomo Nara, protesters express their anger over a report that blames the disaster on Japan's culture of "reflexive obedience" leaving no individual responsible.[307]The Japanese government has admitted it did not keep records of key meetings during the Fukushima nuclear crisis, even though such detailed notes are considered a key component of disaster management.[308] Data from SPEEDI (System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information) were sent by email to the Fukushima prefecture government, but not shared with others. Data from five crucial days, from 12 March 2011 11:54 p.m. to 16 March 9 a.m  holding vital information for evacuation and health advisories  were in emails from NISA to Fukushima that stayed unread and were deleted afterwards. All was revealed more than a year later, on 21 March 2012. The data were not used, because the disaster countermeasure office regarded the data as "useless because the predicted amount of released radiation is unrealistic." [309]Japan's response to the crisis at Fukushima Daiichi was flawed by "poor communication and delays in releasing data on dangerous radiation leaks at the facility", a government-appointed investigative panel has found. The Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company was led by University of Tokyo Professor Yotaro Hatamura. The panel's report attaches blame to Japan's central government as well as Tokyo Electric Power Co., "depicting a scene of harried officials incapable of making decisions to stem radiation leaks as the situation at the coastal plant worsened in the days and weeks following the disaster".[310] The 507-page interim report, which resulted from hundreds of interviews with utility workers and government officials, said poor planning also worsened the disaster response, noting that authorities had "grossly underestimated tsunami risks" that followed the magnitude 9.0 earthquake. The 40-foot-high tsunami that struck the plant was twice as tall as the highest wave predicted by officials, and the erroneous assumption that the plant's cooling system continued to work after the tsunami struck worsened the disaster. "Plant workers had no clear instructions on how to respond to such a disaster, causing miscommunication, especially when the disaster destroyed backup generators. Ultimately, the series of failures led to the worst nuclear catastrophe since Chernobyl".[310]In February 2012, an independent investigation into the accident by the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation described how Japan's response was hindered at times by a loss of trust between the major actors: Prime Minister Naoto Kan, the Tokyo headquarters of TEPCO, and the manager at the stricken plant. The report said that these conflicts "produced confused flows of sometimes contradictory information in the early days of the crisis".[311][312] According to the report, Kan delayed the cooling of the reactors by questioning the use of seawater instead of fresh water. Kan further hindered the response to the crisis by micromanaging disaster management efforts and appointing his own nominees to a small, closed, decision-making staff. The report stated that the Japanese government was also slow to accept assistance from U.S. nuclear experts.[313]A 2012 report in The Economist said: "The reactors at Fukushima were of an old design. The risks they faced had not been well analysed. The operating company was poorly regulated and did not know what was going on. The operators made mistakes. The representatives of the safety inspectorate fled. Some of the equipment failed. The establishment repeatedly played down the risks and suppressed information about the movement of the radioactive plume, so some people were evacuated from more lightly to more heavily contaminated places".[314]From 17 to 19 March 2011, US military aircraft, on behalf of the US Department of Energy, measured the radiation within a 45-km radius of the reactors. The data recorded 125 microsieverts per hour of radiation as far as 25km (15.5mi) northwest of the plant. The US provided the data, illustrated on detailed maps, to the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) on 18 March and to the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) two days later. Japanese government officials did not act on the information provided by the maps.[315]The data were not forwarded to the prime minister's office or the Nuclear Safety Commission, and subsequently not used to direct the evacuation of the people living around the plant. Because a substantial portion of radioactive materials released from the plant went northwest and fell to the ground, and some residents were "evacuated" into this direction, these people could have avoided unnecessary exposure to radiation if the data had been published directly. According to Tetsuya Yamamoto, chief nuclear safety officer of the Nuclear Safety Agency, "It was very regrettable that we didn't share and utilize the information." But an official of the Science and Technology Policy Bureau of the technology ministry, Itaru Watanabe, said it was not Japan, but more appropriate for the United States to release the data.[316]After the Americans published their map on 23 March, Japan felt itself forced to publish, and the fallout maps  compiled from ground measurements and SPEEDI computer simulation/predictions  were released the same day. On 19 June 2012 science minister Hirofumi Hirano defended the decision not to publish, with the remark, that his "job was only to measure radiation levels on land", and that the government would study whether disclosure of the maps could have helped in the evacuation efforts.[317]Regulatory capture may have contributed to the cascade of failures which were revealed after the tsunami receded. Regulatory capture may have also contributed to the current situation. Critics argue that the government shares blame with regulatory agency for not heeding warnings, for not ensuring the independence of the nuclear industry's oversight while encouraging the expansion of nuclear energy domestically and internationally.[318] World media have argued that the Japanese nuclear regulatory system tends to side with and promote the nuclear industry because of amakudari (roughly translated as descent from heaven), in which senior regulators accept high paying jobs at the companies they once oversaw. To protect their potential future position in the industry, regulators seek to avoid taking positions that upset or embarrass the utilities they regulate. TEPCO's position as the largest electrical utility in Japan led it to be the most desirable position for retiring regulators, typically the "most senior officials went to work at Tepco, while those of lower ranks ended up at smaller utilities" according to the New York Times.[319]In August 2011, several top energy officials were fired by the Japanese government; affected positions included the Vice-minister for Economy, Trade and Industry; the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, and the head of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy.[320]The severity of the nuclear accident is provisionally[321] rated 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES). This scale runs from 0, indicating an abnormal situation with no safety consequences, to 7, indicating an accident causing widespread contamination with serious health and environmental effects. Prior to Fukushima, the Chernobyl disaster was the only level 7 accident on record, while the Three Mile Island accident was a level 5 accident. Arnold Gundersen, a former nuclear power industry executive who served as an expert witness in the investigation of the Three Mile Island accident, said that "Fukushima is the biggest industrial catastrophe in the history of mankind,"[322][323][neutrality is disputed] although current estimates of the total amount of radioactivity released from the 3 Fukushima Daiichi reactors is only 10% that from Chernobyl.[324]The Japan Atomic Energy Agency initially rated the Unit 1 situation as below both of these previous accidents; on 13 March it announced it was classifying the event as Level 4, an "accident with local consequences".[325] On 18 March it raised its rating on Units 1, 2 and 3 to Level 5, an "accident with wider consequences". It classified the situation at Unit 4 as a Level 3 "serious incident".[326]Several parties disputed the Japanese classifications, arguing that the situation was more severe than they were admitting at the time. On 14 March, three Russian experts stated that the nuclear accident should be classified at Level 5, perhaps even Level 6.[327] One day later, the French nuclear safety authority and the Finnish nuclear safety authority said that the Fukushima plant could be classified as a Level 6.[328][329] On 24 March, a scientific consultant for noted anti-nuclear environmental group Greenpeace, working with data from the Austrian ZAMG[330] and French IRSN, prepared an analysis in which he rated the total Fukushima accident at INES level 7.[331]The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported on 26 March that the accident might warrant Level 6, based on its calculations.[332] The Wall Street Journal stated that Japan's NISA would make any decision on raising the level.[333] INES Level 6, or "serious accident", had only been applied to the Kyshtym disaster (Soviet Union, 1957), while the only level 7 was Chernobyl (Soviet Union, 1986). Previous Level 5 accidents included the Windscale fire (United Kingdom, 1957), the Lucens reactor (Switzerland, 1969), Three Mile Island (United States, 1979), and the Goinia accident (Brazil, 1987).Assessing "seriousness" as partial or full meltdown at a civilian plant, The New York Times reported on 3 April that based on remote sensing, computer "simulations suggest that the number of serious accidents has suddenly doubled, with three of the reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi complex in some stage of meltdown." The Times counted three previous civilian meltdowns, from World Nuclear Association information: Three Mile Island, Saint-Laurent Nuclear Power Plant (France, 1980, INES level 4), and Chernobyl.[334]On 11 April, the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) temporarily raised the disaster at Fukushima Daiichi to Level 7 on the INES scale, by considering the whole event and not considering each reactor as an individual event (each rated between 3 and 5). This would make Fukushima the second Level 7 "major accident" in the history of the nuclear industry; having said that, radiation released as a result of the events at Fukushima was, as of 12 April, only approximately 10% of that released as a result of the accident at Chernobyl (1986), also rated as INES Level 7.[321][324] As of 21 October 2011, the largest study on Fukushima fallout concludes that Fukushima was "the largest radioactive noble gas release in history not related to nuclear bomb testing. The release is a factor of 2.5 higher than the Chernobyl 133Xe source term", although the "Xenon-133 [main noble gas] does not pose serious health risks because it is not absorbed by the body or the environment."[335][336] Arnold Gundersen said Fukushima has 20 times the potential to be released than Chernobyl. Hot spots are being found 60 to 70 kilometres away from the reactor (further away than they were found from Chernobyl), and the amount of radiation in many of them is the amount that caused areas to be declared no-man's-land for Chernobyl.[337]In off-the-record-interviews with Japanese newspapers like the Tokyo Shimbun, former Japanese prime minister Naoto Kan revealed that there were moments he believed the disaster could have surpassed Chernobyl, many times. At first TEPCO denied that fuel-cores were melted, after all cooling functions were lost. Trade minister Banri Kaieda mentioned that TEPCO seriously considered pulling away all staff-members from the plant and leaving it abandoned. Kan could not accept this: "Withdrawing from the plant is out of the question."[338] He claimed that "If that had happened, Tokyo would be deserted by now. It was a critical moment for Japan's survival. It could have been a led to leaks of dozens of times more radiation than Chernobyl."[339] That might have "compromised the very existence of the Japanese nation".[340]TEPCO's president at that time, Masataka Shimizu, was never clear in his answers, and TEPCO failed to obey the orders to vent one of the overheating reactors. In an interview to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, Kan revealed that he went to the plant itself and visually inspected the plant from above in a helicopter because: "I felt I had to go there in person and speak to the people in charge or I would never have known what was going on."[citation needed] Kan said that the American government was seriously concerned about the Japanese response to the accident: "We were not told straight out, but it was obvious that they questioned whether we were really taking this seriously."[citation needed]Kan did defend his changed attitude to a non-nuclear energy policy with the following remarks: "If there is a risk of accidents that could make half the land mass of our country uninhabitable, then we cannot afford to take that risk."[341]Major news source reporting at least 2 TEPCO employees confirmed dead from "disaster conditions" following the earthquake.[342] "The two workers, aged 21 and 24, sustained multiple external injuries and were believed to have died from blood loss, TEPCO said. Their bodies were decontaminated as radiation has been spewing from the plant for three weeks."[343]A Japanese Research Company was assigned to find out the health effects and casualties caused by the disaster. They found that some deaths were early, during evacuation processes, while other deaths gradually happened after the disaster. The agency found out that the cause of these early deaths were due to the disruption of hospital operations, exacerbation of pre-existing health problems and the stress of dramatic changes in life. It is stated that the vast majority of people who died during their evacuation were elderly.[344] 45 patients were reported dead after the evacuation of a hospital in Futaba due to lack of food, water and medical care as evacuation was delayed by three days.[345]The Associated Press reported that fourteen senior citizens died after being moved from their hospital which was in the Fukushima plant evacuation zone.[346]On 14 April 2011, it was reported that the oldest resident of Iitate, a 102-year-old, committed suicide rather than to leave following the announcement of his village's evacuation.[347]In a nuclear accident situation it is essential for authorities to understand and communicate the direction that contamination is spreading and where it may be deposited on land. Given this information, as well as basic knowledge of the risks of radiation, residents would not feel unnecessary anxiety.[348]The wind increased the radiation to cancer-causing levels up to 100 miles away from the disaster site. Radioactive iodine was released in to the air, if come in contact with, will eventually lead to thyroid cancer. To counteract the radioactive iodine the distribution of potassium iodine is needed. Since Chernobyl, distributing potassium iodide to children has been a standard response when risk of radiation release is high.[349]According to the Japanese Government, over 160,000 people in the general population were screened in March 2011 for radiation exposure and no case was found which affects health.[350] Thirty workers conducting operations at the plant had exposure levels greater than 100 mSv.[351]In April 2011, the United States Department of Energy published projections of the radiation risks over the next year for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50 kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the USA, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. Natural radiation levels are higher in some part of the world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation.[352][353] Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the accident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.[354]As of September 2011, six workers at the Fukushima Daiichi site have exceeded lifetime legal limits for radiation and more than 300 have received significant radiation doses.[355]Workers on-site now wear full-body radiation protection gear, including masks and helmets covering their entire heads, but it means they have another enemy: heat.[356] As of 19 July 2011(2011 -07-19)[update], 33 cases of heat stroke had been recorded.[357] In these harsh working conditions, two workers in their 60s have died from heart failure.[358][359]As of September 2012, there were no deaths or serious injuries due to direct radiation exposures. Cancer deaths due to accumulated radiation exposures cannot be ruled out, and according to one expert, might be in the order of 100 cases.[27] A May 2012 United Nations committee report stated that none of the six Fukushima workers who had died since the tsunami had died from radiation exposure.[360]Frank N. von Hippel, a U.S. scientist, has estimated that "on the order of 1,000" people will die from cancer as a result of their exposure to radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster, that is, an increase of 0.1% in the incidence of cancer, and much less than the approximately 20,000 people killed directly by the earthquake and tsunami. Because contaminated milk was "interdicted in Japan" the number of (mostly non-fatal) thyroid cancer cases will probably be less than 1% of similar cases at Chernobyl. Von Hippel added that "fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas".[20]According to a 2012 Yomiuri Shimbun survey, 573 deaths have been certified as "disaster-related" by 13 municipalities affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. These municipalities are in the no-entry, emergency evacuation preparation or expanded evacuation zones around the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant. A disaster-related death certificate is issued when a death is not directly caused by a tragedy, but by "fatigue or the aggravation of a chronic disease due to the disaster".[361]According to a June 2012 Stanford University study by John Ten Hoeve and Mark Jacobson, the radiation released could cause 130 deaths from cancer (the lower bound for the estimater being 15 and the upper bound 1100) and 180 cancer cases (the lower bound being 24 and the upper bound 1800), mostly in Japan. Radiation exposure to workers at the plant was projected to result in 2 to 12 deaths. The radiation released was an order of magnitude lower than that released from Chernobyl, and some 80% of the radioactivity from Fukushima was deposited over the Pacific Ocean; preventive actions taken by the Japanese government may have substantially reduced the health impact of the radiation release. An additional approximately 600 deaths have been reported due to non-radiological causes such as mandatory evacuations. Evacuation procedures after the accident may have potentially reduced deaths from radiation by 3 to 245 cases, the best estimate being 28; even the upper bound projection of the lives saved from the evacuation is lower than the number of deaths already caused by the evacuation itself.[362]However, that estimate has been challenged, with some scientists arguing that accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life.[363]A survey by the Iitate, Fukushima local government obtained responses from approximately 1,743 people who have evacuated from the village, which lies within the emergency evacuation zone around the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Plant. It shows that many residents are experiencing growing frustration and instability due to the nuclear crisis and an inability to return to the lives they were living before the disaster. Sixty percent of respondents stated that their health and the health of their families had deteriorated after evacuating, while 39.9% reported feeling more irritated compared to before the disaster.[364]Summarizing all responses to questions related to evacuees' current family status, one-third of all surveyed families live apart from their children, while 50.1% live away from other family members (including elderly parents) with whom they lived before the disaster. The survey also showed that 34.7% of the evacuees have suffered salary cuts of 50% or more since the outbreak of the nuclear disaster. A total of 36.8% reported a lack of sleep, while 17.9% reported smoking or drinking more than before they evacuated.[364]Experts on the ground in Japan agree that Mental health challenges are the most significant issue. Stress, such as that caused by dislocation, uncertainty and concern about unseen toxicants, often manifests in physical ailments, such as heart disease. So even if radiation risks are low, people are still concerned and worried. Behavioral changes can follow, including poor dietary choices, lack of exercise and sleep deprivation, all of which can have long-term negative health consequences. People who lost their homes, villages and family members, and even just those who survived the quake, will likely continue to face mental health challenges and the physical ailments that come with stress. Much of the damage was really the psychological stress of not knowing and of being relocated, according to U.C. Berkeley's McKone.[365]On 7 June 2011 a government-appointed committee of 10 people convened to investigate the accident. The panel was headed by Yotaro Hatamura, professor emeritus of the University of Tokyo, and included Yukio Takasu, Michio Furukawa, the mayor of Kawamata, Fukushima, and author Kunio Yanagida, considered an expert on crisis management.[366][367]As part of the government inquiry, the House of Representatives of Japan's special science committee directed TEPCO to submit to them its manuals and procedures for dealing with reactor accidents. TEPCO responded by submitting manuals with most of the text blotted out. In response, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency ordered TEPCO to resubmit the manuals by 28 September 2011 without hiding any of the content. TEPCO replied that it would comply with the order.[368]On 24 October NISA published a large portion of Tokyo Electric Power Company's procedural manuals for nuclear accidents. These were the manuals that the operator of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant earlier did send to the Lower House with most of the contents blacked out, saying that this information should be kept secret to protect its intellectual property rights, and that disclosure would offer information to possible terrorists. NISA ordered TEPCO to send the manuals without any redaction, as the law orders. 200 pages were released from the accident procedural manuals used for Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. All their contents were published, only the names of individuals were left out.From these documents could be concluded:The agency said, the decision to publish the manuals was taken, for transparency in the search what caused the nuclear accident in Fukushima and also to establish better safety measures for the future.[369]On 24 October 2011 the first meeting was held by a group of 6 nuclear energy specialists invited by NISA to discuss the lessons to be learned from the accidents in Fukushima. Their first remarks were:According to professor Tadashi Narabayashi of the Hokkaido University Graduate School, plant operators should arrange emergency power supplies with other utilities. These discussion should be completed in March 2012, to be able to implement their conclusions into the new safety-regulations by the new nuclear safety agency to be launched in April 2012.[370]The Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company was formed 7 June 2011 by the Japanese government as an independent body to investigate the Fukushima Daiichi disaster.[371] The Investigation Committee issued an interim report in December 2011, and is expected to issue its final report summer, 2012. The interim report was "a scathing assessment of the response to the Fukushima disaster", in which the investigative panel "blamed the central government and the Tokyo Electric Power Co., saying both seemed incapable of making decisions to stem radiation leaks as the situation at the coastal plant worsened in the days and weeks after the disaster".[372]In February 2012, an independent investigation into the accident by the Rebuild Japan Initiative Foundation said that "In the darkest moments of last year's nuclear accident, Japanese leaders did not know the actual extent of damage at the plant and secretly considered the possibility of evacuating Tokyo, even as they tried to play down the risks in public". The government was preparing for the possibility of having to evacuate Tokyo while assuring its millions of residents that everything was under control.[311]Officials revealed in interviews that they were grappling the possibility of a "demonic chain reaction": If Fukushima collapsed and released enough radiation, it was possible that other nearby nuclear power plants would have to be abandoned and could also collapse, thereby necessitating the evacuation of one of the world's largest cities.[340]A 2012 report in The Economist said that the response to Fukushima has, so far, been inadequate, as many questions remain. One of the more worrying is how much damage the earthquake did to the reactors:[373]It is claimed that they weathered the quake, but some experts, such as Masashi Goto, a retired nuclear engineer, argue that there is evidence of significant damage that speeded up the subsequent meltdown. Analysis of the spread of fallout suggests that the first releases came very soon after the tsunami hit, if not before. With quakes a more constant threat than monster tsunamis, these are the sort of lessons that Japans "nuclear village" needs to learn.[373]Oregon's United States Senator Ron Wyden toured the plant and issued a statement that the situation was "worse than reported." He sent a letter to Japanese Ambassador Ichiro Fujisaki urging Japan to seek international help to relocate spent fuel rods stored in unsound structures and prevent leakage of dangerous nuclear material.[374][375]TEPCO released its final internal investigation report on 20 June 2012. In the report, TEPCO complained that top politicians, including the prime minister, interfered with recovery efforts during the initial stages of the disaster by making specific requests that were out of touch with what was actually taking place at the plant. TEPCO concluded that the direct cause of the accident was the tsunami which knocked out the reactors' cooling system. TEPCO also admitted that it was at fault in not being prepared for the situation, but said that its workers did the best they could "amid unprecedented circumstances."[376]On July 5, 2012, the National Diet of Japan Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission released an executive summary report[377] of The Fukushima Nuclear Accident. The report "blames Japanese culture for the fundamental causes of the disaster."[378][379][380][381] The panel is due to deliver its final report at the end of July.[378]According to Munich Re, a major reinsurer, the private insurance industry will not be significantly affected by the accidents at the Fukushima nuclear power plant.[382] Swiss Re similarly states "Coverage for nuclear facilities in Japan excludes earthquake shock, fire following earthquake and tsunami, for both physical damage and liability. Swiss Re believes that the incident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant is unlikely to result in a significant direct loss for the property & casualty insurance industry."[383]Radioactive material has been released from the Fukushima containment vessels as the result of deliberate venting to reduce gaseous pressure, deliberate discharge of coolant water into the sea, and accidental or uncontrolled events. Concerns about the possibility of a large scale radiation leak resulted in 20km exclusion zone being set up around the power plant and people within the 2030km zone being advised to stay indoors. Later, the UK, France and some other countries told their nationals to consider leaving Tokyo, in response to fears of spreading radioactive contamination.[384] The Fukushima accident has led to trace amounts of radiation, including iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137, being observed around the world (New York State, Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon, California, Montreal, and Austria).[385][386][387] Large amounts of radioactive isotopes have also been released into the Pacific Ocean.A monitoring system designed to detect nuclear explosions, operated by the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), tracked the dispersion of radioactivity from the crippled nuclear reactor on a global scale. Radioactive isotopes originating from Fukushima were picked up by over 40 CTBTO radionuclide monitoring stations. The CTBTO makes its monitoring data and analysis results available to all its 183 Member States. Around 1,200 scientific and academic institutions in 120 countries currently make use of this offer.[388]On 12 March, radioactive releases first reached a CTBTO monitoring station in Takasaki, Japan, around 200km away from the troubled power plant. The dispersion of the radioactive isotopes could then be followed to eastern Russia on 14 March and to the west coast of the United States two days later. By day 15, traces of radioactivity were detectable all across the northern hemisphere. Within one month, radioactive particles were also picked up by CTBTO stations in the southern hemisphere, located for example in Australia, Fiji, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea.[389][390]According to one expert, the release of radioactivity is about one-tenth that from the Chernobyl disaster and the contaminated area is also about one-tenth that of Chernobyl.[20] A March 2012 report by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology agreed that radioactive debris from the damaged reactors had dispersed about one-eighth to one-tenth of the distance as those in the Chernobyl disaster.[391][392] But according to a study conducted by Norwegian Institute for Air Research, the release of caesium-137 was about 40percent of the total from Chernobyl.[393][394][395]In March 2011, Japanese officials announced that "radioactive iodine-131 exceeding safety limits for infants had been detected at 18 water-purification plants in Tokyo and five other prefectures".[396] As of July 2011[update], the Japanese government has been unable to control the spread of radioactive material into the nation's food. Radioactive material has been detected in a range of produce, including spinach, tea leaves, milk, fish and beef, up to 200 miles from the nuclear plant. Inside the 12-mile evacuation zone around the plant, all farming has been abandoned.[397][398]As of August 2011[update], the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant is still leaking low levels of radiation and areas surrounding it could remain uninhabitable for decades due to high radiation. It could take "more than 20years before residents could safely return to areas with current radiation readings of 200millisieverts per year, and a decade for areas at 100millisieverts per year".[399]On 24 August 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission (NSC) of Japan published the results of the recalculation of the total amount of radioactive materials released into the air during the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. The total amounts released between 11March and 5April were revised downwards to 1.31017Bq for iodine-131 and 1.11016Bq for caesium-137, which is about 11% of Chernobyl emissions. Earlier estimations were 1.51017Bq and 1.21016Bq.[400][401]On 8 September 2011 a group of Japanese scientists working for the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, the Kyoto University and other institutes, published the results of a recalculation of the total amount of radioactive material released into the ocean: between late March through April they found a total of 15,000TBq for the combined amount of iodine-131 and caesium-137. This was more than triple the figure of 4,720TBq estimated by the plant-owner. TEPCO made only a calculation about the releases from the plant in April and May into the sea. The new calculations were needed because a large portion of the airborne radioactive substances would enter the seawater when it came down as rain.[402]In the first half of September 2011 the amount of radioactive substances released from the plant was about 200million becquerels per hour, according to TEPCO, this was approximately one four-millionth of the level of the initial stages of the accident in March.[403] Traces of iodine-131 are still detected in several Japanese prefectures in the months of November[404] and December 2011.[405]According to a report published in October 2011 by the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, between 21March and mid-July around 2.71016Bq of caesium-137 entered the ocean, about 82percent having flowed into the sea before 8April. This emission of radioactivity into the sea represents the most important individual emissions of artificial radioactivity into the sea ever observed. The Fukushima coast has one of the world's strongest currents and this transported the contaminated waters far into the Pacific Ocean, causing a high dispersion of the radioactive elements. The results of measurements of both the seawater and the coastal sediments lead to suppose that the consequences of the accident, for what concerns radioactivity, will be minor for marine life as of late 2011 (weak concentration of radioactivity in the water and limited accumulation in sediments). On the other hand, significant pollution of sea water along the coast near the nuclear plant might persist, because of the continuing arrival of radioactive material transported towards the sea by surface water running over contaminated soil. Further, some coastal areas might have less favorable dilution or sedimentation characteristics than those observed so far. Finally, the possible presence of other persistent radioactive substances, such as strontium-90 or plutonium, has not been sufficiently studied. Recent measurements show persistent contamination of some marine species (mostly fish) caught along the coast of Fukushima district. Organisms that filter water and fish at the top of the food chain are, over time, the most sensitive to caesium pollution. It is thus justified to maintain surveillance of marine life that is fished in the coastal waters off Fukushima.[406]As of March 2012, there had been no reported cases of Fukushima residents suffering ailments related to radiation exposure. Experts cautioned that insufficient data was available so far to make conclusions on the impact on residents' health. Nevertheless, Michiaki Kai, professor of radiation protection at Oita University of Nursing and Health Sciences, stated, "If the current radiation dose estimates are correct, (cancer-related deaths) likely won't increase."[407]On 24 May 2012, TEPCO released their estimate of radiation releases due to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster. An estimated 538,100 terabecquerels (TBq) of iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137 was released. 520,000 TBq was released into the atmosphere between March 12 to March 31, 2011 and 18,100 TBq into the ocean from March 26 to September 30, 2011. A total of 511,000 TBq of iodine-131 was released into both the atmosphere and the ocean, 13,500 TBq of caesium-134 and 13,600 TBq of caesium-137.[408]In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released "into the atmosphere in March last year [2011] alone".[24][25] In August 2012, researchers found that 10,000 people living near the plant at the time of the accident had been exposed to well less than 1 millisievert of radiation, far less than Chernobyl residents.[409]In October 2012 an article in Science-magazine concluded, that at that time radiation was still leaking from the reactor-site into the ocean. Fishing in the waters around the site was still prohibited, and the levels of radioactive 134Cs and 137Cs in the fish caught were not lower compared with the levels found after the disaster. [410] On 26 October 2012 TEPCO admitted that it could not exclude radiation emissions into the ocean, although the radiation levels were stabilised. Undetected leaks into the ocean from the reactors, could not be ruled out, because their basements remain flooded with cooling water, and the 2,400-foot-long steel and concrete wall between the sites reactors and the ocean, that should reach 100 feet underground, was still under construction, and would not be finished before mid-2014. Around August 2012 two greenling were caught close to the Fukushima shore, they contained more than 25,000 becquerels a kilogram of cesium, the highest cesium levels found in fish since the disaster and 250 times the governments safety limit.[411][412]The people of Japan have endured and forever will be affected with heavy amount of radiation. Unfortunately the government has not come out to help the people with there homes and problems. Even rain fall still strikes fear into the peoples hearts due to an under preparation for the new decontamination equipment, back in June of 2011. Occurrence of natural events cause a fight to the people of Japan, even rain can have the ability to carry toxic waste and radiation throughout Japan. "Rain raises fear of more contamination at Fukushima". 3 November 2012. http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/06/03/japan.nuclear.water/index.html?iref=allsearch.A rough translation of the word Fukushima, in English, is happy-land. After the earthquake and tsunami struck this translation has fallen from its meaning. The people of Japan are far from feeling safe in these dire times. The massive amounts of radiation that are infiltrating the lands of Japan, equivalent to the event in Chernobyl, have stricken fear into the hearts of the people of Japan. To counteract this fear, the government has enacted an order to decontaminate over a hundred areas with a level contamination greater than or equivalent to one millisievert of radiation, which is the recommended level of radiation in which decontamination is needed. Majority of the public of japan lives in steady fear of being exposed to radiation. This is caused due to the lack education on the extent of which they are being exposed, causing the people of Japan to be afraid to walk down the streets for fear that the nearby puddles are emitting radiation levels. [413]A nuclear emergency was declared by the government of Japan on 11 March 2011. The Japanese government initially set in place a 4 step evacuation process; a prohibited access area out to 3 km from the plant, an on alert area 3-20 km from the plant, and a evacuation prepared area 20-30 km from the plant. These evacuation areas were based on radioactivity levels above 20 mSv. On day one of the disaster nearly 134,000 people who lived between 3-20 km from the plant were evacuated. 4 days later an additional 354,000 who lived between 20-30 km from the plant were evacuated. Later Prime Minister Naoto Kan issued instructions that people within a 20km (12mi) zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant must leave, and urged that those living between 20km and 30km from the site to stay indoors.[414][415] The latter groups were also urged to evacuate on 25 March.[416] The US Nuclear Regulatory Commisson suggested that US citizens living within or visting within 50 miles or 80 km of the plant to evacuate. [417][418]Japanese authorities have admitted that lax standards and poor oversight contributed to the nuclear disaster.[419] They have come under fire for their handling of the emergency, and have engaged in a pattern of withholding damaging information and denying facts of the accident.[419][420][421][422] Authorities apparently wanted to "limit the size of costly and disruptive evacuations in land-scarce Japan and to avoid public questioning of the politically powerful nuclear industry". There has been public anger about an "official campaign to play down the scope of the accident and the potential health risks".[421][422] The accident is the second biggest nuclear accident after the Chernobyl disaster, but more complex as all reactors are involved.[423]Once a proponent of building more reactors, Prime Minister Naoto Kan took an increasingly anti-nuclear stance in the months following the Fukushima disaster. In May, he ordered the aging Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant be closed over earthquake and tsunami fears, and said he would freeze plans to build new reactors. In July 2011, Mr. Kan said that "Japan should reduce and eventually eliminate its dependence on nuclear energy ... saying that the Fukushima accident had demonstrated the dangers of the technology".[424]On 22 August 2011 a spokesman of the Japanese Government mentioned the possibility, that some areas of the evacuation zone around the nuclear plant for "could stay for some decades a forbidden zone". According to the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun the Japanese government was planning to buy some properties from civilians to store radioactive waste and materials that had become radioactive after the accidents.[425][426] Chiaki Takahashi, Japan's foreign minister, criticized foreign medias reports over accidents in Fukushima Daichii as overdone and excessive. But Takahashi added that "he can understand the concerns of foreign countries over recent developments at the nuclear plant, including the radioactive contamination of seawater".[427]Due to frustration with Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and the Japanese government "providing differing, confusing, and at times contradictory, information on critical health issues"[428] a citizen's group called "Safecast" has been recording detailed radiation level data in Japan.[429] The Japanese government "does not consider non-government readings to be authentic". The group uses off-the-shelf Geiger counter equipment. It is important to note that a simple Geiger counter is a contamination meter and not a dose rate meter, as the response differs so much between different radioisotopes it is not possible to use a simple GM tube for dose rate measurements when more than one radioisotope is present. A thin metal shield is needed around a GM tube to provide energy compensation to enable it to be used for dose rate measurements. For measurements of dose rates due to gamma emitters either an ionization chamber, a gamma spectrometer or an energy compensated GM tube should be used. Members of the Air Monitoring station facility at the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of Berkeley, California have been doing extensive tests of environmental samples in Northern California.[430]The international reaction to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster has been diverse and widespread. Many inter-governmental agencies are responding to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, often on an ad hoc basis. Responders include International Atomic Energy Agency, World Meteorological Organization and the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization, which has radiation detection equipment deployed around the world.[431]Many countries have advised their nationals to leave Tokyo, citing the risk associated with the nuclear plants' ongoing accident. International experts have said that a workforce in the hundreds or even thousands would take years or decades to clean up the area.[432] Stock prices of many energy companies reliant on nuclear sources have dropped.There has been a significant re-evaluation of existing nuclear power programs in many countries. One poll found that what had been growing acceptance of nuclear power in the United States was eroded sharply following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, with 43% approving and 50% disapproving of building new plants.[433] Worldwide, a study by UBS, reported on 12 April 2011, suggests that around 30 nuclear plants may be closed as a result of Fukushima, with those located in seismic zones or close to national boundaries being the most likely to shut. Events at Fukushima "cast doubt on the idea that even an advanced economy can master nuclear safety".[434] Increased anti-nuclear sentiment has been evident in India, Italy, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States.Much of the help and decontamination work could be done by AREVA France with boron acid, shutting down one reactor, protection suits, measurement equipment, generators, filters; by more than 1000 men with own first-hand help and information offered.[435]The multiple nuclear reactor units involved in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster were close to one another and this proximity triggered the parallel, chain-reaction accidents that led to hydrogen explosions blowing the roofs off reactor buildings and water draining from open-air spent fuel pools. This situation was potentially more dangerous than the loss of reactor cooling itself. Because of the proximity of the reactors, plant workers were put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with core meltdowns at three reactors and exposed fuel pools at three units.On 21 December 2011, the Japanese government released a roadmap for the cleanup activities, which predicted that the full cleanup will take 40 years.[437] On 10 April 2011, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) began using remote-controlled, unmanned heavy equipment to remove debris from around nuclear reactors 14. TEPCO announced on 17 April that it expected to have the automated cooling systems restored in the damaged reactors in about three months and have the reactors put into cold shutdown status in six months. TEPCO planned to largely empty the basements of the turbine and reactor buildings of units 13 of contaminated water by the end of 2011 to allow workers access to the crucial basement areas of both the turbine and reactor buildings.[438]When the monsoon season began in June 2011, a light fabric cover was used to protect the damaged reactor buildings from storms and heavy rainfall. On 1 August 2011, TEPCO said that very high radiation levels were found outside the building of reactor 1 and 2 from an exhaust-pipe. On 16 August, TEPCO announced the installation of devices in the spent fuel pools of reactor 2, 3 and 4, which used special membranes and electricity to desalinate the water. These pools were cooled with seawater for some time, and TEPCO feared the salt would corrode stainless steel pipes and the pool walls. Burying the reactors in sand and concrete is considered to be a last resort.In October 2011, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said the government will spend at least 1 trillion yen ($13 billion) to clean up vast areas contaminated by radiation from the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Japan "faces the prospect of removing and disposing 29 million cubic meters of soil from a sprawling area in Fukushima, located 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of Tokyo, and four nearby prefectures".[439]By March 2012, one year after the disaster, all but two of Japan's nuclear reactors had been shut down; some were damaged by the quake and tsunami. Authority to restart the others after scheduled maintenance throughout the year was given to local governments, and in all cases local opposition prevented restarting. The loss of 30% of the country's generating capacity has led to much greater reliance on liquified natural gas and coal.[440] Unusual conservation measures have also been necessary. In the immediate aftermath, nine prefectures served by TEPCO suffered power rationing.[441] The government asked major companies to reduce power consumption by 15%, and some shifted their weekends to weekdays to even out power demand.[442]If Japan was to convert to a gas and oil entergy economy, going completely nuclear-free, the repercussions of this event would cost the people and government tens of billions of dollars in annual fees. Oil and gas could only suffice for a temporary fix to help with the summer months, but is not the long term answer. At this time the cost of oil and gas had increased to exponetial levels with the war in Iraq still in it's peak moments and the US Government asking to stop trade with the Middle East, would thrusted Japan into an economic bind, if this enregy decision was made. [443]According to The Japan Times, the Fukushima nuclear disaster changed the national debate over energy policy almost overnight. "By shattering the government's long-pitched safety myth about nuclear power, the crisis dramatically raised public awareness about energy use and sparked strong anti-nuclear sentiment". A June 2011 Asahi Shimbun poll of 1,980 respondents found that 74% answered "yes" to whether Japan should gradually decommission all 54 reactors and become nuclear free.[444]An energy white paper, approved by the Japanese Cabinet in October 2011, says "public confidence in safety of nuclear power was greatly damaged" by the Fukushima disaster, and calls for a reduction in the nation's reliance on nuclear power. It also omits a section on nuclear power expansion that was in last year's policy review.[445]Environmental activists at a 2011 United Nations meeting in Bangkok used the Fukushima disaster as an example to promote accelerated use of renewable energy.[446]Physicist Amory Lovins has said: "Japan is poor in fuels, but is the richest of all major industrial countries in renewable energy that can meet the entire long-term energy needs of an energy-efficient Japan, at lower cost and risk than current plans. Japanese industry can do it faster than anyone  if Japanese policymakers acknowledge and allow it".[306] Benjamin K. Sovacool has said that, with the benefit of hindsight, the Fukushima disaster was entirely avoidable in that Japan could have chosen to exploit the country's extensive renewable energy base. Japan has a total of "324GW of achievable potential in the form of onshore and offshore wind turbines (222GW), geothermal power plants (70 GW), additional hydroelectric capacity (26.5GW), solar energy (4.8GW) and agricultural residue (1.1GW)."[447]One result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster could be renewed public support for the commercialization of renewable energy technologies.[448] In August 2011, the Japanese Government passed a bill to subsidize electricity from renewable energy sources. The legislation will become effective on 1 July 2012, and require utilities to buy electricity generated by renewable sources including solar power, wind power and geothermal energy at above-market rates.[449]In September 2011, Mycle Schneider said that the Fukushima disaster can be understood as a unique chance "to get it right" on energy policy. "Germany  with its nuclear phase-out decision based on a highly successful renewable energy program  and Japan  having suffered a painful shock but possessing unique technical capacities and societal discipline  can be at the forefront of an authentic paradigm shift toward a truly sustainable, low-carbon and nuclear-free energy policy".[450]As of September 2011[update], Japan plans to build a pilot floating wind farm, with six 2-megawatt turbines, off the Fukushima coast.[451] After the evaluation phase is complete in 2016, "Japan plans to build as many as 80 floating wind turbines off Fukushima by 2020."[451]In 2012, Naoto Kan said the Fukushima disaster made it clear to him that "Japan needs to dramatically reduce its dependence on nuclear power, which supplied 30% of its electricity before the crisis, and has turned him into a believer of renewable energy".[304]Sales of solar cells in Japan rose 30.7% to 1,296 megawatts in 2011, helped by a government scheme to promote renewable energy. Canadian Solar plans to build a factory in Japan and is currently in negotiations with local governments in Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures. The facility is expected to have a capacity of 150 megawatts of solar panels a year, could go online as soon as 2013.[452]As of September 2012, most Japanese people support the zero option on nuclear power, and Prime Minister Noda and the Japanese government announced a dramatic change of direction in energy policy, promising to make the country nuclear-free by the 2030s. There will be no new construction of nuclear power plants, a 40-year lifetime limit on existing nuclear plants, and any further nuclear plant restarts will need to meet tough safety standards of the new independent regulatory authority. The new approach to meeting energy needs will also involve investing $500 billion over 20 years to commercialize the use of renewable energy sources such as wind power and solar power.[453]The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission (NAIIC) is the first independent investigation commission by the National Diet in the 66-year history of Japans constitutional government. NAICC was established on December 8, 2011 with the mission to investigate the direct and indirect causes of the Fukushima nuclear incident. NAICC submitted its report to both houses on July 5, 2012.[a][30] The 10-member commission compiled its report based on more than 1,167 interviews and 900 hours of hearings.[454][455]It was a six-month independent investigation, the first of its kind with wide-ranging subpoena powers in Japan's constitutional history, which held public hearings with former Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Tokyo Electric Power Co's former president Masataka Shimizu, who gave conflicting accounts of the disaster response.[456] The commission chairman, Kiyoshi Kurokawa, declared with respect to the Fukushima nuclear incident: It was a profoundly man-made disaster  that could and should have been foreseen and prevented.[457][458] Across the board, the commission found ignorance and arrogance unforgivable for anyone or any organization that deals with nuclear power, the NAIIC report said.[459] The report outlines errors and willful negligence at the plant before the 2011 Thoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011 and a flawed response in the hours, days and weeks that followed. It also offers recommendations and encourages Japan's parliament to "thoroughly debate and deliberate" the suggestions.[460]The determination of the causes of the accident that occurred at Fukushima Daiichi and Daini Nuclear Power Stations of Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), and those of the damages generated by the accident, and thereby making policy proposals designed to prevent the expansion of the damages and the recurrence of similar accidents in the future was the purpose of the Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations (ICANPS).[461] The 10 member,[462] government-appointed panel included scholars, journalists, lawyers and engineers,[463] was supported by public prosecutors and government experts[464] and released its final, 448-pages[465] investigation report on July 23, 2012.[31][466]The panel interviewed 772 people,[465] including plant workers, government officials and evacuees,[467] for a total of nearly 1,479 hearing hours.[465] Its report was the fourth investigation into the crisis after the earlier release of a parliamentary study, a private report by journalists and academics as well as an investigation by TEPCO.[468] The panel said the government and TEPCO failed to prevent the disaster not because a large tsunami was unanticipated, but because they were reluctant to invest time, effort and money in protecting against a natural disaster considered unlikely.[467] "The utility and regulatory bodies were overly confident that events beyond the scope of their assumptions would not occur . . . and were not aware that measures to avoid the worst situation were actually full of holes," the government panel said in its final report.[469] The panel's report faulted an inadequate legal system for nuclear crisis management, a crisis-command disarray caused by the government and Tepco, and possible excess meddling on the part of the prime minister's office in the early stage of the crisis.[470] The panel concluded that a culture of complacency about nuclear safety and poor crisis management led to the nuclear disaster.[462]Japanese prosecutors as a sequel to criminal complaints, including accusations that TEPCO executives and government officials committed 'acts of professional negligence have reportedly begun a criminal investigation into last years Fukushima nuclear plant accident.[471]1 Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant

Hawaii Five-0 is an American police procedural drama television series and a re-imagining of the original 196880 television series. The series is produced by K/O Paper Products and 101st Street Television in association with CBS Productions. The title of the new show uses a zero in place of the letter "O" in the original title.[1]Hawaii Five-0 debuted on CBS, the same network that aired the original version. Like the original version, it follows an elite state police unit/task force set up to fight crime in the state of Hawaii. It premiered on Monday, September 20, 2010, 42 years to the day from the premiere of the original show, September 20, 1968. On October 21, 2010, CBS announced that Hawaii Five-0 had been given a full season order of 24 episodes.[2]On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed Hawaii Five-0 for a third season,[3] which premiered on September 24, 2012.[4]The series covers the actions of a small special state task force created by the Governor of Hawaii, Gov. Pat Jameson, to investigate serious crimes throughout the Islands, as Hawaii does not have a conventional state police force. The team is headed by Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett, USNR as it investigates crimes ranging from terrorism to kidnapping. McGarrett chooses as his partner Honolulu PD Detective Danny "Danno" Williams. He fills out the team by selecting Chin Ho Kelly, and Chin's cousin, a rookie HPD cop named Kono Kalakaua. The task force does not follow the normal chain of command and instead reports directly to the Governor's office. One unexplained part of the story concerns the name Five-0. Taken from a shirt worn by the young Steve McGarrett in a video that the team watches, Kono decides that Five-0 would be a good name for their task force. However, it is not explained how everyone (including tourists) seems to know what Five-0 is despite it being an unofficial name coined in a private meeting,[5][6] although the name appears to have been made official in later episodes. Five-0's headquarters are apparently located in Aliiolani Hale, site of a famous Kamehameha Statue, which features prominently in the series; in real life Aliiolani Hale serves as the central headquarters of the Hawai'i State Judiciary and where the Supreme Court of Hawaii regularly convenes.Each episode typically begins with a crime being committed or a body being discovered (although in one episode the team was assigned to provide protection for a foreign dignitary), and assignment of the subsequent criminal investigation to the unit by either the governor herself or her representative. The task force uses the authority of the governor's office to gain access to crime scenes and investigations involving the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) when they cross paths. To assist them in their investigations, the team is granted immunity from prosecution for actions committed in the line of duty, although this immunity is revoked by the lieutenant governor following the governor's assassination.A major character arc set up in the pilot episode revolves around the murder of McGarrett's father, who was working on a corruption case even after retiring from the HPD. After the terrorist responsible for his father's murder is apprehended, a mysterious figure interrogates him about Steve's investigation into his father's old cases. This figure is later revealed to be Wo Fat, a criminal with ties to the Japanese Yakuza, and is possibly connected to the suspected car-bomb murder of Steve's mother (a death originally ruled an accident). When his father investigated this as the head of the HPD Organized Crime Task Force, he began to dig too far into the corruption, forcing him to lay off the investigation. He nonetheless saved all his evidence in a toolbox, all of which was left to his son in the hope that he would someday conclude his father's work.Another character arc involves the reasons behind Chin Ho's departure from the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) after being accused of stealing cash from the HPD asset forfeiture locker. McGarrett accepts Chin Ho onto the task force, as he was his father's protg. As the series progresses, it is revealed that a mole within HPD framed Chin Ho for the theft, and that this mole was also possibly connected to McGarrett Sr.'s old corruption probe.In the season one finale, the Five-0 task force is disbanded after McGarrett is arrested for Governor Jameson's murder. However, in the second season, the new governor, Sam Denning, reinstates the task force after McGarrett is proven innocent; but the team no longer has absolute immunity and must follow the Governor's rules. Governor Denning appoints Lori Weston from the Department of Homeland Security to the Five-0 task force in episode 2 to monitor the team; she resigns after the task force is involved in a diplomatic incident at the Russian consulate.In season two, Masi Oka's Dr. Max Bergman, M.E., discovers his biological mother was the victim of a serial murderer who has started killing again. There was a cooling of relations between Rachel and Danny to the point, by the end of the season, where Danny was about to fight Rachel and her current husband Stan's plan to take Danny's daughter Grace with them on their move to the mainland. Kono is involved in an undercover assignment, for five episodes, where she appeared to have lost her badge, but was actually working HPD Internal Affairs Capt. Vincent Fryer, who was investigating a group of former cops engaged in illegal activities. Chin Ho and his former fiance reunite and marry, with the Five-0 task force and Kamekona as members of their wedding party.McGarrett continues to try to learn more about the death of his father and the mysterious Shelburne. His former SEAL Commander, Joe White (who was also a friend of McGarrett's father), arrives in the islands and appears to be helping McGarrett at times and getting in his way at others. Wo Fat returns and is involved in a series of murders, including the leader of the Yakuza, Hiro Noshimuri, and is being hunted down by them. At the end of the season, Joe takes McGarrett to see Shelburne in Japan; Shelburne turns out to be his mother, who was presumed dead for 20 years.[7]The idea to bring Hawaii Five-O back to television had been under consideration well before the 2010 version was announced. The first attempt was a one-hour pilot for a new series that was made in 1996 but never aired, although a few clips were found years later and are available online. Produced and written by Stephen J. Cannell, it was intended to star Gary Busey and Russell Wong as the new Five-0 team. Original cast member James MacArthur briefly returned as Dan Williams, this time as governor of Hawaii, with cameos made by other former Five-O regulars. Another attempt was made to turn the project into a film by Warner Bros. but that also was scrapped.[10]On August 12, 2008, CBS announced that it would bring Hawaii Five-O back to the network schedule for the 20092010 television season. The new version would be an updated present-day sequel, this time centering around Steve McGarrett, who succeeds his late father Steve (Jack Lord's character in the original series) as the head of the unit. Ed Bernero, executive producer and showrunner of Criminal Minds, was to helm the new take, which he described as "Hawaii Five-O, version 2.0". It was also to incorporate most of the iconic elements from the original, including the "Book 'em, Danno" catchphrase, into the remake. Bernero, who was a fan of the original, and had a ring tone of the series' theme song on his cell phone, had always wanted to bring the series back to TV.[11] This version did not go beyond the script stage.In October 2009, it was announced that Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci had signed on to script a pilot episode, and that Peter M. Lenkov would serve as the series showrunner.[12] Kurtzman and Orci decided to reboot the original concept similar to their work on the 2009 Star Trek film, rather than a sequel to the original series. Production on the pilot was shot in and around Honolulu from February to April 2010.On May 17, 2010, the Hawaii Five-O remake was picked up by CBS, which scheduled it for Monday nights in the 1011 pm timeslot.[13][14] The news was good for the state of Hawaii, which hopes that the remake will pump new life into the economy. Production of the remainder of the first season started in June 2010.[15][16] On June 24, 2010, the producers announced that it will use the warehouse at the former Honolulu Advertiser building as the official soundstage studio for the series starting in July 2010.[17] Exteriors representing Five-0 headquarters in the series are located at the Judiciary History Center of the Supreme Court Building in Honolulu, directly across the street from Iolani Palace, which represented Five-O headquarters in the original series.This revival series uses a zero as the last character in its title instead of the letter "O" that is used in the title of the original series. According to The Los Angeles Times, a CBS insider said that the disambiguation was necessary because of search engine results.[18] When Variety conducted its own search engine test on Google, it found that "Hawaii Five-0" (with the zero) had 263,000 results while "Hawaii Five-O" (with the letter O) had over 1.7 million.[19]On August 18, 2011, CBS announced that Hawaii Five-0 would cross over with NCIS: Los Angeles by having Daniela Ruah guest star as Kensi Blye from the latter series.[20] The crossover aired on October 24, 2011, in episode 6 of season 2. A two-part crossover was aired on the April 30, 2012 episode of Hawaii Five-0 and the May 1, 2012 episode of NCIS: Los Angeles, with two characters from each show visiting the other (Callen and Hanna from NCIS: Los Angeles and Danny and Chin Ho from Five-0).In February 2010, it was announced that Daniel Dae Kim had been cast to play Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-cop trained by Steve McGarrett's father. He was the first actor cast for the remake.[21] Several days later, Alex O'Loughlin was cast as Steve McGarrett,[22] the son of ex-cop John McGarrett (portrayed by William Sadler). The producers pay homage to the original series by making one of Steve's hobbies restoring his father's 1974 Mercury Marquis, which is in fact the actual car driven by Jack Lord in the latter half of the original series' run.[23] Actress Grace Park was later cast as rookie detective Kona "Kono" Kalakaua,[24] and Scott Caan was cast as Danny "Danno" Williams. In the recurring cast are Jean Smart as Governor Pat Jameson and Masi Oka as the medical examiner Max Bergman. Oka was upgraded to series regular for the second season.[25]Of note, several recurring roles have been filled by surviving members of the original cast. Al Harrington, who played Det. Ben Kokua in the original series, now plays a friend of McGarrett's, Mamo Kahike.[26] Dennis Chun, who had various guest roles in the original series and is the son of Kam Fong Chun (the actor that portrayed the original Chin Ho), has a recurring role as HPD Sgt. Duke Lukela in the remake.[27] James MacArthur, the last surviving main cast member from the original series, agreed to guest star in a first season episode; however, he died on October 28, 2010, before filming his appearance.[28]Larisa Oleynik was cast as Jessica Kaye[29] (changed to Jenna Kaye in the episode broadcast),[30] scheduled to join the Five-0 task force in the show's 19th episode.[31] Oleynik appeared on a recurring basis for the remainder of the 201011 season, with an option to become a regular in season 2;[32] however, her character was killed off in season 2, episode 10. It was also announced that Terry O'Quinn would be joining the cast of the show in season two,[33] along with Lauren German, who would play Lori Weston, a former Homeland Security (and FBI agent) official assigned by the new governor to keep an eye on the team.[34]For season three, Christine Lahti has been cast in a recurring role as Doris McGarrett, the thought-to-be-deceased mother of Steve McGarrett.[35] Also, Michelle Borth who plays Lt. Catherine Rollins will become main cast for season 3.Hawaii Five-0 uses the original show theme song composed by Morton Stevens. Critics received an early copy of the pilot with a synthesizer and guitar-based version of the theme. After negative reaction to the reworked song spread quickly online, Kurtzman said he and others realized that changing the music was a mistake, and arranged for studio musicians,[36] including three who had worked on the original from 1968,[37] to rerecord the theme "exactly as it was", except shortened to 30 seconds[36] from its original length of about 60 seconds.[38] Original instrumental music is composed by Brian Tyler and Keith Power.[39]Hawaii Five-0: Original Songs from the Television Series is a soundtrack album featuring music used in the CBS television series Hawaii Five-0. The first volume in the series received attention for how show producers integrated these new and previously unreleased tracks from major-name artists into the second season episodes. This method contrasted with the norm for TV soundtracks, which tend to be compilations of previously released music that is already available individually or on other albums. Hawaii Five-0: Original Songs from the Television Series was released on October 4, 2011, according to [1] Amazon.com.| "What Makes You Beautiful" || One Direction ||The series premiered in the U.S. on CBS on September 20, 2010. Canada's Global TV and NTV premiered the show at the same time as the United States premiere.[40] Hawaii Five-0 has been syndicated for broadcast in several countries worldwide, including Australia,[41] the United Kingdom,[42] France,[43] Germany,[44] Italy,[45][46] Japan,[47] Spain,[48] the Middle East,[49] the Netherlands,[50] and South Africa.[51]The show has received mostly positive reviews, scoring a 65 out of 100 aggregate score on Metacritic as of October 12, 2010.[2] On May 19, 2010, The Honolulu Advertiser offered an opinion about the new version: "A smart script, slick production values and maybe a splash of nostalgia got the remake of Hawaii Five-O placed on the CBS prime-time lineup this fall, but it will take more than beefcake and a remixed theme song to keep the show on the air." The piece also pointed out that times have changed since the original left the air, citing other shows that were set in Hawaii which have come and gone. It expressed a hope that the producers will succeed in bringing a new life to the title with this remake.[52] The show also has a large, hugely devoted fanbase, often called an "ohana". Hawaii Five-0 was also in the Guinness World Records 2012 for Highest-Rated New Show in the U.S. with a record 19.34 million viewers for its January 23, 2011 episode (Kai ee).[53]Series star Scott Caan was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Series, Miniseries or Television Film for his role as Danny on Hawaii Five-0. Hawaii Five-0 also won the "Favorite New TV Drama" at the 37th People's Choice Awards on January 5, 2011.Hawaii Five-0 made several positive effects on the state's economy since it began airing. Known as the "Five-0 Effect" by Hawaii News Now reporter Steve Uyehara, various Hawaii-based businesses saw an increase in sales after they were featured in episodes of the show. Visitor numbers to the USS Missouri Memorial Association, after being featured in some of the episodes, increased 25 percent, helping the site achieve a record year in 2010. Waiola Shave Ice, the business run by Kamekona on the show, saw a 20 percent increase in shave ice sales, along with a 30 percent rise in t-shirt sales. Kona Brewing Company also saw a 60 percent increase in sales after their beers were featured as McGarrett's favored alcoholic beverage in several episodes. In addition, residents from other states visit Hawaii based on viewing the series.[61]TNT has acquired the off network rights to air the series. Episodes will begin on the cable channel in 2014.[62]Hawaii Five-0 at TV.comPeter M.

"Steve" McGarrett, USNR, a former Navy SEAL with time spent in Office of Naval Intelligence. He is named after his grandfather, a USS Arizona casualty. McGarrett's father John is murdered in the pilot episode, and this forms the basis for the series' first story arc. (In Season 1 episode 4, "Lanakila", it was revealed that John McGarrett was born on March 15, 1942, and died September 20, 2010.) Steve McGarrett is both physically and intellectually capable, being able to speak Hawaiian and Chinese fluently while also being able to engage a person in hand to hand combat as well as utilizing fieldcraft when needed. McGarrett utilizes close quarters combat as his primary means of taking down suspects, something he was taught during SEAL training. He is an experienced Navy SEAL, as the governor once outlined his resume "Annapolis, five years Naval Intelligence, six years with the SEALs. Your superiors say that you are the best they have ever seen."Scott Caan as Detective Sergeant Daniel "Danny" (or "Danno") Williams, a Honolulu Police Department (HPD) detective, who transferred from the Newark Police Department when his ex-wife, Rachel, moved to Hawaii with their daughter Grace. Williams' "by-the-book" style contrasts with McGarrett's more impulsive "the ends justify the means" approach, and is a source of friction (and banter) between the two. Regarded as a haole for wearing a tie on the island during the first season, Williams is a loyal cop who is married to his job first and life second. As a consequence, he is often at odds with his ex-wife Rachel for sometimes not being on time. He is a loyal cop and friend, once refusing to believe that his former police partner was corrupt even when pitted against overwhelming evidence after the partner was found dead (season 1, episode 8).Daniel Dae Kim as Detective Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly, a former member of the HPD (reinstated in finale of season 1) and protg of McGarrett's father, who left the force after being falsely accused of corruption. It is later revealed that his uncle, a retired cop, took the money to pay for medical bills for his aunt. Despite insistence that he come clean, Kelly is willing to take the blame to prevent his uncle from going to jail. He is eventually cleared of the corruption charges and is reinstated to the HPD as a Lieutenant, but returns to the task force.Grace Park as Officer Kono Kalakaua, a recent HPD academy graduate and former professional surfer, who is also Chin Ho Kelly's cousin. She is detained and questioned by the HPD, having been accused of stealing $10 million from an HPD asset forfeiture locker.

He is later arrested by McGarrett in 2x22 - Ua Hopu.Larisa Oleynik as ex-CIA analyst Jenna Kaye, assistant to Five-0. She is later revealed to have an association with Wo Fat. At the end of an episode, she is seen driving Wo Fat away after he murdered Victor Hesse. She leaves to follow-up on a lead that her fianc, Josh whom she claimed had been killed by Wo Fat, might in fact be alive and asks Steve to go with her to North Korea to get him. It turns out to be a trap for McGarrett, from Wo Fat telling Jenna he'd release Josh if she brought him McGarrett, explaining her association with him. Jenna later discovers that Josh had been dead the entire time and that it was also a trap for her. She is able to tell McGarrett she's sorry for setting him up and gives him a pin to help him escape moments before Wo Fat shoots and kills her (season 2, episode 10).Taylor Wily as Kamekona, proprietor of Waiola Shave Ice and Kamekona's shrimp truck.

Modern Family is an American comedy which debuted on ABC on September 23, 2009. Presented in mockumentary style, the fictional characters frequently talk directly into the camera. It tells of Jay Pritchett, his second wife and step son, and his two children and their families. Lloyd and Levitan conceived the series while sharing stories of their own "modern families."The series premiered to critical acclaim and was watched by 12.6 million viewers.[1][2] Early on, it was named as a key contender for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[3] Soon after, on October 8, 2009, the series was picked up for a full season.[4][5] The series has received positive reviews from critics and received several award nominations. The series has won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in each of the past three years and the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series three times so far as well, twice for Eric Stonestreet and once for Ty Burrell, as well as the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series twice for Julie Bowen.[6][7] It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series Musical or Comedy.[8]The syndication rights to the show have also been sold to USA Network and 10 Fox affiliates for a fall 2013 premiere.[9][10][11] The success of the show has also led it to being the sixteenth-highest revenue-generating show for 2010, earning $1.6 million an episode.[12] Brian Lowry, of Variety, sums up the show in regards to the airing of the pilot episode: "Flitting among three storylines, it's smart, nimble and best of all, funny, while actually making a point about the evolving nature of what constitutes 'family'".[13]As Lloyd and Levitan retold stories about their families, it occurred to them that that could be the basis for a show. They started working on the idea of a family being observed in a mockumentary style show. They later decided it could be a show about three families and their experiences,[14] and originally called My American Family.[15] The creators pitched it to three of the four major networks. (They did not pitch it to Fox because of issues Lloyd had with the network over Back to You.)[16] CBS, not ready to use the single-camera style of filming nor ready to make another large commitment, rejected the series (Welcome to The Captain and Worst Week were single-camera sitcoms that recently aired on CBS but both lasted one season). NBC, already having two shows with a mockumentary format  The Office and Parks and Recreation  decided against accepting the show before the success of the other two series decreased. ABC accepted the series and picked it up for a full season.[16] Modern Family is an adaptation of a French TV show Fais pas ci, fais pas a of which ABC bought the rights in 2008.[17]The series quickly became a priority for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) after the pilot episode tested high with focus groups, resulting in the network ordering 16 episodes and adding it to the 20092010 fall lineup days ahead of ABC's official schedule announcement.[18][19][20] The series was given a full season pickup on October 8, 2009.[4][5] On January 12, 2010, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson announced that Modern Family had been renewed for a second season.[21] A third season was ordered by ABC on January 10, 2011.[22] The series was also picked up for syndication by USA during the first season for 1.5 million dollars and to 10 Fox affiliates during the second season.[9][10][11][23] The series airs in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland on Sky1.[24]Principal photography takes place in Los Angeles.[13] Creators Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan, whose credits both include Frasier, Wings, and Just Shoot Me,[15] are executive producers of the series, serving as showrunner and head writer under their Lloyd-Levitan Productions label in affiliation with Twentieth Century Fox Television.[13] The other producers on the writing team are Paul Corrigan, Sameer Gardezi, Joe Lawson, Dan O'Shannon, Brad Walsh, Caroline Williams, Bill Wrubel, Danny Zuker, and Jeff Morton.[13][25] The first team of directors included Jason Winer, Michael Spiller, Randall Einhorn, and Chris Koch. Winer has directed nineteen episodes of the series, making him the most prolific director of the series.[13][26]As a result of the show's success, the cast attempted in the summer of 2012 to renegotiate their existing contracts to obtain higher per-episode fees. However, talks broke down to the point where the first table read for the fourth season had to be postponed. Five of the cast members (Burrell, Bowen, Ferguson, Stonestreet and Vergara) retained the Quinn Emanuel law firm and sued 20th Century Fox Television in Los Angeles County Superior Court on July 24, 2012. While not part of the lawsuit, Ed O'Neill (who had been earning more per episode than the other five) joined his fellow castmates in seeking raises for each to about $200,000 per episode. Their complaint invoked the "seven-year rule" in California Labor Code Section 2855 (the De Havilland Law), and requested a declaration that their contracts were void because as drafted, the contracts were in violation of that rule.[27] Although the lawsuit is still pending, the performers returned for their first table read on July 26, 2012, with the understanding that the producers would resume contract negotiations in good faith.[28]Modern Family employs an ensemble cast. The show revolves around three families that are interrelated through Jay Prichett and his children, Claire and Mitchell. Jay Prichett (Ed O'Neill), the patriarch, is married to a much younger woman, Gloria (Sofa Vergara), a passionate[29] mother, who raises her son, Manny (Rico Rodriguez). Claire (Julie Bowen) is a homemaker mom married to Phil (Ty Burrell), a real estate agent and self-professed "cool dad". They have three children: Haley (Sarah Hyland) the stereotypical teenager,[30] Alex (Ariel Winter), the smart middle child[31] and Luke (Nolan Gould), the offbeat only son.[32] Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a lawyer, and his partner Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) have adopted a Vietnamese baby, Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons). In the first season, the adult cast was paid from a range of $30,000 per episode to about $90,000.[33]The series has also had several recurring characters. Reid Ewing appeared in several episodes as Haley's boyfriend, Dylan.[34] Fred Willard has guest starred as Phil's father, Frank Dunphy, and later went on to be nominated at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, but lost to Neil Patrick Harris's performance on Glee.[35] Shelley Long has appeared in both seasons as Claire and Mitchell's biological mother and Jay's ex-wife, DeDe Pritchett.[36][37] Nathan Lane appeared twice during the second season as Cameron and Mitchell's flamboyant friend, Pepper Saltzman.[38][39][40]Appearing in a few episodes is Jay and Gloria's dog Stella. Stella was played by Brigitte, but is now being played by Beatrice.[41]The characters in green have regular roles on the show. Dotted lines indicate a parental relationship through adoption or marriage, and dashed lines indicate a divorce between characters.The series premiered Wednesday, September 23, 2009 in the 9:00pm ET timeslot. Soon after, the series was picked up for a full season of 24 episodes on October 8, 2009.[4][5] On January 12, 2010, Modern Family was renewed for a second season by ABC.[42] The second season premiered September 22, 2010, airing in the same timeslot as the previous season.[43] Midway through the second season, the network renewed the series for a third season on January 10, 2011.[22] The third season premiered on September 21, 2011 with two back-to-back episodes,[44] beginning with a one-hour special. On May 10, 2012, Modern Family was renewed for a fourth season by the channel,[45][46] premiering on September 26, 2012.The first season was met with universal critical acclaim. It received a Metacritic score of 86 out of 100.[47] Entertainment Weekly gave it an A-, calling it "immediately recognizable as the best new sitcom of the fall".[48] In Time's review, the show was named "the funniest new family comedy of the year".[49] It has also been compared to the 1970s series Soap, in regards to the multiple family aspect. Some have made comparisons to The Office and Parks and Recreation, due to their mockumentary formats.[50] BuddyTV named the show the second best show in 2009, saying, "Every actor is fantastic, every family is interesting, and unlike many shows, there isn't a weak link".[51] Robert Canning of IGN gave the season a 8.9 saying it was "Great" and called it "Simply put, Modern Family was one of the best new comedies of the season." He also praised the ensemble cast and the characters calling them lovable.[52] According to Metacritic, the first season was the best reviewed new broadcast television series.[53]Modern Family's outstanding cast continues to impress, and even wobbly episodes reliably supply sharp observations and goofball charm.The second season received positive reviews much like the first season, despite being given criticism for a sophomore slump. Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the new season four stars out of four, saying, "Not since Frasier has a sitcom offered such an ideal blend of heart and smarts, or proven itself so effortlessly adept at so many comic variations, from subtle wordplay to big-laugh slapstick to everything in between."[55] Robert Bianco in a later review stated "as good as it was in its first year, is even better in its second" positively comparing the characters to the characters from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Cosby Show and Friends.[56] During the second season, Adweek named the show one of the 100 Most Influential TV Shows (98th chronologically).[57][58] Despite this, the season received criticism from some critics for a sophomore slump.[59][60] Eric Stonestreet, who received praise during the first season,[61] was criticized during the second season for being too over the top.[62][63] Alan Sepinwall called Cameron Tucker a "whiny, overly-sensitive diva".[62] On the other hand, Ty Burrell has received praise for his performance as Phil Dunphy through both seasons.[61][64][65]The third season received an overall mixed reception. Slant Magazine reviewer Peter Swanson wrote that while the first episode was "the type of wacky-location stunt that's usually reserved for the fifth or sixth season of a dying sitcom", the following episodes "have been better [...] but they're still uneven".[66] He also criticized the writers for relying too much on "stunt episodes and celebrity cameos, like David Cross".[66] He ultimately gave the season 3 out of 4 stars.[66] James Parker of The Atlantic said, at the beginning of the third season that "Modern Family is very, very funny, almost ruthlessly so ... [It's] a bit of a master class in pace and brevity ... The writing is Vorsprung durch Technik: hectically compressed but dramatically elegant, prodigal in its zingers and snorters but austere in its construction." He found it an exception to his dislike for sitcoms that eschew a laugh track.[67]In The New York Times, Bruce Feiler called attention to how the show depicts the increasing way communications technology shapes the way people perceive others, even family members. "[It] is surely the first family comedy that incorporates its own hashtag of simultaneous self-analysis directly into the storyline," he writes. "Mark Zuckerberg may be a greater influence on Modern Family than Norman Lear."[68]The show's writers and actors agree. "We used to talk about how cellphones killed the sitcom because no one ever goes to anyone's house anymore" for routine information, Abraham Higginbotham told Feiler. "We embrace technology so it's part of the story." Ty Burrell draws on Fran Lebowitz's observation that there is no institution other than media. "I had this little flash of Philand methat we are parsing our personality together externally from how people perceive us."[68]James Parker said that "The American family circa 2011 is, after all, an acutely self-conscious and self-interrogating unit: How does one 'parent'? Who does what, which 'role'? Is Dad sufficiently dad-like and Mom enough of a mom?" he writes. "Modern Family taps right into all this, the cameras that lurch through its three households producing the sensation of a wild and shaky experiment, recorded for purposes educational or scientific."[67]Modern Family drew criticism from the LGBT community for its portrayal of Cameron and Mitchell as not being physically affectionate with each other. The criticism spawned a Facebook campaign to demand Mitchell and Cameron be allowed to kiss. In response to the controversy, producers released a statement that a season two episode would address Mitchell's discomfort with public displays of affection. Executive producer Levitan has said that it was unfortunate that the issue had arisen, since the show's writers had always planned on such a scene "as part of the natural development of the show."[69] The episode "The Kiss" eventually aired with the kiss scene in the background which drew praise from multiple critics.[70][71]During the third season, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni argued that gay criticism of Cameron and Mitchell actually showed the progress gays have made toward social acceptance. "A decade ago," he writes, "[gays] would have balkedand balked loudlyat how frequently Cameron in particular tips into limp-wristed, high-voiced caricature." But now, "most gay people trust that the television audience knows we're a diverse tribe, not easily pigeonholed ... Modern Family endows us with a sort of comic banality. It's an odd kind of progress. But it's progress nonetheless."[72]Another notable criticism of Modern Family from various online news sources is that the show reinforces gender roles and sexist stereotypes. Michelle Haimoff of the Christian Science Monitor criticized the show for only casting the women as stay-at-home moms while the husbands on the show have very successful careers: "There is a difference between quirky, flawed characters and ones who are incapable of professional success. And when the latter is reliably female, it makes for sexist television. It also makes for unrealistic television."[73] Other authors reinforce this criticism by pointing out that stay-at-home mothers are no longer the norm in today's society.[74] According to the Department of Labor, 68.9% of married moms are working or looking for work. Thus, it's no surprise that the lack of representation for working moms sparked conversation on Twitter: "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon writer Ali Waller asked her Twitter followers, If Modern Family is so modern then why dont any of the women have jobs?[75]According to a CNET staffer, commenting on an episode: "The wife and daughter are unable to learn how to use the remote and must be taught by the father, while the son is 'good with electronics,' even though he is thought of as the stupidest member of the family."[76] In the episode "Game Changer," one of the wives on the show, Gloria, hides her skill at chess so that her husband will not be upset at losing: "On its own, this moment is at best a sappy quip about compromise in an often heavy-handed series, and at worst, it's a moment in a show with 9.3 million viewers, on a network owned by Disney, which explicitly validates girls and women subduing their intellect."[77]By contrast, Hanna Rosin has praised the show as one of several that have begun subverting the longtime American sitcom stereotype of bumbling fathers incapable of managing anything at home despite being the only one employed. "Phil Dunphy should be the house boob, with his embarrassing philosophy of 'peerenting,'" she wrote in Slate. "But Dunphy is not just comic relief; he's a successful salesman and the center of joy and fun in his household, especially compared to his uptight wife. No one really disdains him, and the domestic space belongs as much to him as to her."[78]In 2010, Modern Family was nominated with five Television Critics Association Awards. The show gained nominations for best new series, best comedy series and best program of the year, while Ty Burrell and Eric Stonestreet were nominated individually.[79] Like Friends, to reinforce the idea of an ensemble cast, the cast all submitted themselves in the Supporting Actor and Actress categories instead of Lead Actor and Actress for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[80] On August 29, 2010, Modern Family won Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series (for the pilot episode), and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (Eric Stonestreet). The show also later received a GLSEN Respect Award for its portrayal of "positive images and storylines that reflect a diverse America, including the depiction of a family headed by a gay couple."[81] In 2010, the cast won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy, beating the previous year's winner, Glee.[82] On July 14, 2011, the series received 17 Emmy nominations, the third most nominations for the year after Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire.[83] The awards the series was nominated for include Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actor for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.[83] The series has also been put on multiple critics' lists. In 2010, the series was listed on BuddyTV's Top Ten Best Comedy Shows of 20092010,[84] 2nd on Time's Top Ten Best shows of 2009,[85] 2nd on BuddyTV's Top Ten Best Shows of 2009,[86] Jason Hughes Best TV of 2009,[87] 10th on BuddyTV's Top 10 Returning Shows We're Most Excited to Come Back,[88] and on TV Guide's Our Favorite Families[89] Modern Family was awarded a Peabody Award in 2009.[90] In 2012, the show won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series  Musical or Comedy[8] and was nominated for a British Academy Television Award. In 2012, the show received a total of fourteen Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series, and nominations for all six of its adult actors in the Supporting Actor and Actress Comedy categories.Both Ann Romney (wife of US presidential candidate Mitt Romney) in an interview with The Insider and First Lady Michelle Obama in an interview with Kal Penn at the 2012 Democratic National Convention have cited Modern Family as their favorite TV show.Since its premiere, the series has remained popular. In its first season, the show became the sixth highest-rated scripted show in America among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, and the third-highest rated new show.[91] Aided by winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the show's second season became the highest rated show on Wednesday on premiere week[92] and also rose 34% from the previous season among adults between the ages of 18 and 49.[93] The show frequently ranked as television's top scripted series in adults 1849 as well.[94][95][96] The success of the show has been positively compared to The Cosby Show.[97] During the 20102011 season, Modern Family was the highest rated scripted show in the 1849 demographic, and the third highest rated overall sitcom behind CBS's The Big Bang Theory and Two and a Half Men.[98][99] The season also ranked first among DVR viewers.[100] The third season premiere became ABC's top-rated season premiere in six years.[101] The series success in ratings has also led to the series being credited for reviving sitcoms.[102]Modern Family at TV.com1 Production

Peter "Pete" Seeger (born May 3, 1919) is an iconic American folk singer. A fixture on nationwide radio in the 1940s, he also had a string of hit records during the early 1950s as a member of The Weavers, most notably their recording of Lead Belly's "Goodnight, Irene", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950.[1] Members of The Weavers were blacklisted during the McCarthy Era. In the 1960s, he re-emerged on the public scene as a prominent singer of protest music in support of international disarmament, civil rights, and environmental causes.As a song writer, he is best known as the author or co-author of "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" (with Joe Hickerson), "If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)", (composed with Lee Hays of The Weavers), and "Turn, Turn, Turn!", which have been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement and are still sung throughout the world. "Flowers" was a hit recording for The Kingston Trio (1962); Marlene Dietrich, who recorded it in English, German and French (1962); and Johnny Rivers (1965). "If I Had a Hammer" was a hit for Peter, Paul & Mary (1962) and Trini Lopez (1963), while The Byrds popularized "Turn, Turn, Turn!" in the mid-1960s, as did Judy Collins in 1964, and The Seekers in 1966. Seeger was one of the folksingers most responsible for popularizing the spiritual "We Shall Overcome" (also recorded by Joan Baez and many other singer-activists) that became the acknowledged anthem of the 1960s American Civil Rights Movement, soon after folk singer and activist Guy Carawan introduced it at the founding meeting of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960. In the PBS "American Masters" episode Pete Seeger: The Power of Song, Seeger states it was he who changed the lyric from the traditional "We will overcome" to the more singable "We shall overcome".Seeger was born in French Hospital, Midtown Manhattan.[citation needed] His Yankee-Protestant family, which Seeger called "enormously Christian, in the Puritan, Calvinist New England tradition",[2] traced its genealogy back over 200 years. A paternal ancestor, Karl Ludwig Seeger, a physician from Wurtemberg, Germany, had emigrated to America in revolutionary times and married into an old New England family in the 1780s.[3] His namesake, Pete's father, Harvard-trained composer and musicologist Charles Louis Seeger, Jr., established the first musicology curriculum in the U.S. at the University of California in 1913; helped found the American Musicological Society; and was a key founder of the academic discipline of ethnomusicology. Pete's mother, Constance de Clyver Edson, raised in Tunisia and trained at the Paris Conservatory of Music, was a concert violinist and later a teacher at the Juilliard School.[4]In 1912 Charles Seeger was hired to establish the music department at the University of California, Berkeley, but was forced to resign in 1918 because of his outspoken Pacifism during World War I.[5] Charles and Constance moved back east, making Charles' parents' estate in Patterson, New York, northeast of New York City, their base of operations. When baby Pete was eighteen months old, they set out with him and his two older brothers in a home-made trailer, on a quixotic mission to bring musical uplift to the working people in the American South.[6] On their return, Constance taught violin and Charles composition at the New York Institute of Musical Art (later Juilliard), whose president, family friend Frank Damrosch, was Constance's adoptive "uncle". Charles also taught part-time at the New School for Social Research. Career and money tensions led to quarrels and reconciliations, but when Charles discovered Constance had opened a secret bank account in her own name, they separated, and Charles took custody of their three sons.[7] Beginning in 1936, Charles held various administrative positions in the federal government's Farm Resettlement program, the WPA's Federal Music Project (19381940), and the wartime Pan American Union. After World War II, he taught ethnomusicology at the University of California and Yale University.[8][9]Charles and Constance Seeger divorced when Pete Seeger was seven, and in 1932 Charles married his composition student and assistant, Ruth Crawford Seeger, now considered by many one of the most important modernist composers of the 20th century.[10] Deeply interested in folk music, Ruth had contributed musical arrangements to Carl Sandburg's extremely influential folk song anthology the American Songbag (1927) and later created significant original settings to eight of Sandburg's poems.[11] Pete's eldest brother, Charles Seeger III, was a radio astronomer, and his next older brother, John Seeger, taught in the 1950s at the Dalton School in Manhattan and was the principal from 1960 to 1976 at Fieldston Lower School in the Bronx.[12] Pete's uncle, Alan Seeger, a noted poet ("I Have a Rendezvous with Death"), had been one of the first American soldiers to be killed in the First World War. All four of Pete's half siblings from his father's second marriage  Margaret (Peggy), Mike, Barbara, and Penelope (Penny)  became folk singers. Peggy Seeger, a well-known performer in her own right, was married for many years to British folk singer and activist Ewan MacColl. Mike Seeger was a founder of the New Lost City Ramblers, one of whose members, John Cohen, married Pete's half-sister Penny (herself a talented singer who died young); Barbara Seeger joined her siblings in recording folks songs for children.In 1943, Pete married Toshi-Aline ta, whom he credits with being the support that helped make the rest of his life possible. Their first child, Peter ta Seeger, was born in 1944 and died at six months while Pete was deployed overseas. Pete never saw him.[13] They went on to have three more children: Daniel (an accomplished photographer and filmmaker); Mika (a potter and muralist); and Tinya Seeger (a potter)  and grandchildren Tao (a musician); Cassie Seeger (an artist); Kitama Cahill-Jackson (a filmmaker); Moraya (graduate student married to NFL player Chris DeGeare); Penny; and Isabelle. Tao is a folk musician in his own right, singing and playing guitar, banjo and harmonica with the Mammals. Kitama Jackson is a documentary filmmaker who was associate producer of the PBS documentary Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.Seeger lives in Beacon, New York. He remains very engaged politically and maintains an active lifestyle in the Hudson Valley Region of New York, especially in the nearby City of Beacon, New York. He and Toshi purchased their land in 1949 and lived there first in a trailer, then in a log cabin they built themselves.[14]At four, Seeger was sent away to boarding school, but came home two years later, when his parents learned the school had failed to inform them he had contracted scarlet fever.[15] He attended first and second grades in Nyack, New York, where his mother lived, before entering boarding school in Ridgefield, Connecticut.[16] Despite being classical musicians, his parents did not press him to play an instrument. On his own, the otherwise bookish and withdrawn boy gravitated to the ukulele, becoming adept at entertaining his classmates with it, while laying the basis for his subsequent remarkable audience rapport. At thirteen, Seeger enrolled in the Avon Old Farms prep school in Avon, Connecticut where he graduated in 1936. He was selected to attend Camp Rising Sun, the George E. Jonas Foundation's international summer leadership program. During the summer of 1936, while traveling with his father and stepmother, Pete heard the five-string banjo for the first time at the Mountain Dance and Folk Festival in western North Carolina near Asheville, organized by local folklorist, lecturer, and traditional music performer Bascom Lamar Lunsford, whom Charles Seeger had hired for Farm Resettlement music projects.[17] The festival took place in a covered baseball field. There the Seegerswatched square-dance teams from Bear Wallow, Happy Hollow, Cane Creek, Spooks Branch, Cheoah Valley, Bull Creek, and Soco Gap; heard the five-string banjo player Samantha Bumgarner; and family string bands, including a group of Indians from the Cherokee reservation who played string instruments and sang ballads. They wandered among the crowds who camped out at the edge of the field, hearing music being make there as well. As Lunsfords daughter would later recall, those country people "held the riches that Dad had discovered. They could sing, fiddle, pick the banjos, and guitars with traditional grace and style found nowhere else but deep in the mountains. I can still hear those haunting melodies drift over the ball park."[18]For the Seegers, experiencing the beauty of this music firsthand was a "conversion experience". Pete was deeply affected and, after learning basic strokes from Lunsford, spent much of the next four years trying to master the five-string banjo.[18] The teenage Seeger also sometimes accompanied his parents to regular Saturday evening gatherings in at the Greenwich Village loft of painter and art teacher Thomas Hart Benton and his wife Rita. Benton, a lover of Americana, played "Cindy" and "Old Joe Clark" with his students Charlie and Jackson Pollock; friends from the "hillbilly" recording industry; as well as avant-garde composers Carl Ruggles and Henry Cowell. It was at one of Benton's parties that Pete heard "John Henry" for the first time.[19] Seeger enrolled at Harvard College on a partial scholarship, but as he became increasingly involved with politics and folk music, his grades suffered and he lost his scholarship. He dropped out of college in 1938.[20] He dreamed of a career in journalism and also took courses in art. His first musical gig was leading students in folk singing at the Dalton School, where his aunt was principal. He polished his performance skills during a summer stint of touring New York State with The Vagabond Puppeteers (Jerry Oberwager, 22; Mary Wallace, 22; and Harriet Holtzman, 23), a traveling puppet theater "inspired by rural education campaigns of post-revolutionary Mexico".[21] One of their shows coincided with a strike by dairy farmers. The group reprised its act in October in New York City. An article in the October 2, 1939, Daily Worker reported on the Puppeteers' six-week tour this way:During the entire trip the group never ate once in a restaurant. They slept out at night under the stars and cooked their own meals in the open, very often they were the guests of farmers. At rural affairs and union meetings, the farm women would bring "suppers" and would vie with each other to see who could feed the troupe most, and after the affair the farmers would have earnest discussions about who would have the honor of taking them home for the night."They fed us too well," the girls reported. "And we could live the entire winter just by taking advantage of all the offers to spend a week on the farm."In the farmers' homes they talked about politics and the farmers problems, about antisemitism and Unionism, about war and peace and social security"and always," the puppeteers report, "the farmers wanted to know what can be done to create a stronger unity between themselves and city workers. They felt the need of this more strongly than ever before, and the support of the CIO in their milk strike has given them a new understanding and a new respect for the power that lies in solidarity. One summer has convinced us that a minimum of organized effort on the part of city organizationsunions, consumers bodies, the American Labor Party and similar groupscan not only reach the farmers but weld them into a pretty solid front with city folks that will be one of the best guarantees for progress.[22]That fall Seeger took a job in Washington, D.C., assisting Alan Lomax, a friend of his father's, at the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress. Seeger's job was to help Lomax sift through commercial "race" and "hillbilly" music and select recordings that best represented American folk music, a project funded by the music division of the Pan American Union (later the Organization of American States), of whose music division his father, Charles Seeger, was head (193853).[23] Lomax also encouraged Seeger's folk singing vocation, and Seeger was soon appearing as a regular performer on Alan Lomax and Nicholas Ray's weekly Columbia Broadcasting show Back Where I Come From (194041) alongside of Josh White, Burl Ives, Leadbelly, and Woody Guthrie (whom he had first met at Will Geer's Grapes of Wrath benefit concert for migrant workers on March 3, 1940). Back Where I Come From was unique in having a racially integrated cast, which made news when it performed in March 1941 at a command performance at the White House organized by Eleanor Roosevelt called "An Evening of Songs for American Soldiers,"[24] before an audience that included the Secretaries of War, Treasury, and the Navy, among other notables. The show was a success but was not picked up by commercial sponsors for nationwide broadcasting because of its integrated cast. During the war, Seeger also performed on nationwide radio broadcasts by Norman Corwin.As a self-described "split tenor" (between an alto and a tenor),[26] Pete Seeger was a founding member of two highly influential folk groups: The Almanac Singers and The Weavers. The Almanac Singers, which Seeger co-founded in 1941 with Millard Lampell and Arkansas singer and activist Lee Hays, was a topical group, designed to function as a singing newspaper promoting the industrial unionization movement,[27] racial and religious inclusion, and other progressive causes. Its personnel included, at various times: Woody Guthrie, Bess Lomax Hawes, Baldwin "Butch" Hawes, Sis Cunningham, Josh White, and Sam Gary. As a controversial Almanac singer, the 21-year-old Seeger performed under the stage name "Pete Bowers" to avoid compromising his father's government career.In 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as The Weavers, named after the title of a 1892 play by Gerhart Hauptmann about a workers' strike (which contained the lines, "We'll stand it no more, come what may!"). Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman (later, Frank Hamilton, Erik Darling and Bernie Krause serially took the place of Seeger). In the atmosphere of the 1950s red scare, the Weavers' repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect languagearguably rendering it even more powerful. The Weavers even on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who had dressed informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues. Because of this, the somewhat hokey string orchestra and chorus arrangements on their hit records with Decca Records, and, no doubt also because of their considerable, if temporary, financial success, the Weavers incurred criticism from some progressives for supposedly compromising their political integrity. It was a tricky dilemma, but Seeger and the other Weavers felt that the imperative of getting their music and their message out to the widest possible audience amply justified these measures. The Weavers' string of major hits began with "On Top of Old Smokey" and an arrangement of Leadbelly's signature waltz, "Goodnight, Irene," which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950 and was covered by many other pop singers. On the flip side of "Irene" was the Israeli song "Tzena, Tzena, Tzena." Other Weaver hits included Dusty Old Dust" ("So Long It's Been Good to Know You") (by Woody Guthrie), "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine" (by Hays, Seeger, and Lead Belly), the South African Zulu song, "Wimoweh" (about "the lion," warrior chief Shaka Zulu), to name a few.The Weavers' performing career was abruptly derailed in 1953 at the peak of their popularity when blacklisting prompted radio stations to refuse to play their records and all their bookings were canceled. They briefly returned to the stage, however, at a sold-out reunion at Carnegie Hall in 1955 and in a subsequent reunion tour, which produced a hit version of Merle Travis's "Sixteen Tons" as well as LPs of their concert performances. "Kumbaya," a Gullah black spiritual dating from slavery days, was also introduced to wide audiences by Pete Seeger and the Weavers (in 1959), becoming a staple of Boy and Girl Scout campfires.In the late 1950s, the Kingston Trio was formed in direct imitation of (and homage to) the Weavers, covering much of the latter's repertoire, though with a more buttoned-down, uncontroversial, and mainstream collegiate persona. The Kingston Trio produced another phenomenal succession of Billboard chart hits and in its turn spawned a legion of imitators, laying the groundwork for the 1960s commercial folk revival.In the documentary film Pete Seeger: The Power of Song (2007), Seeger states that he resigned from the Weavers when the three other band members agreed to perform a jingle for a cigarette commercial.In 1948, Seeger wrote the first version of his now-classic How to Play the Five-String Banjo, a book that many banjo players credit with starting them off on the instrument. He went on to invent the Long Neck or Seeger banjo. This instrument is three frets longer than a typical banjo, is slightly longer than a bass guitar at 25 frets, and is tuned a minor third lower than the normal 5-string banjo. Hitherto strictly limited to the Appalachian region, the five-string banjo became known nationwide as the American folk instrument par excellence, largely thanks to Seeger's championing of and improvements to it. According to an unnamed musician quoted in David King Dunaway's biography, "by nesting a resonant chord between two precise notes, a melody note and a chiming note on the fifth string", Pete Seeger "gentrified" the more percussive traditional Appalachian "frailing" style, "with its vigorous hammering of the forearm and its percussive rapping of the fingernail on the banjo head."[28] Although what Dunaway's informant describes is the age-old droned frailing style, the implication is that Seeger made this more acceptable to mass audiences by omitting some of its percussive complexities, while presumably still preserving the characteristic driving rhythmic quality associated with the style.From the late 1950s on, Seeger also accompanied himself on the 12-string guitar, an instrument of Mexican origin that had been associated with Lead Belly, who had styled himself "the King of the 12-String Guitar". Seeger's distinctive custom-made guitars had a triangular soundhole. He combined the long scale length (approximately 28") and capo-to-key techniques that he favored on the banjo with a variant of drop-D (DADGBE) tuning, tuned two whole steps down with very heavy strings, which he played with thumb and finger picks.[29]In 1956, then "Peter" Seeger (see film credits) and his wife, Toshi, traveled to Port of Spain, Trinidad, to seek out information on the steelpan, steel drum or "Ping-Pong" as it was sometimes called. The two searched out a local panyard and proceeded to film the construction, tuning and playing of the then new, national instrument of Trinidad-Tobago.On January 18, 2009, Seeger joined Bruce Springsteen, grandson Tao Rodrguez-Seeger, and the crowd in singing the Woody Guthrie song "This Land Is Your Land" in the finale of Barack Obama's Inaugural concert in Washington, D.C.[30][31] The performance was noteworthy for the inclusion of two verses not often included in the song, one about a "private property" sign the narrator cheerfully ignores, and the other making a passing reference to a Depression-era relief office.[30][32]On May 3, 2009, at The Clearwater Concert, dozens of musicians gathered in New York at Madison Square Garden to celebrate Seeger's 90th birthday (which was later televised on PBS during the summer),[33] ranging from Dave Matthews, John Mellencamp, Billy Bragg, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Morello, Ani DiFranco and Roger McGuinn to Joan Baez, Richie Havens, Tom Paxton, Ramblin' Jack Elliott and Arlo Guthrie. Cuban singer-songwriter Silvio Rodrguez was also invited to appear but his visa was not approved in time by the US government. Consistent with Seeger's long-time advocacy for environmental concerns, the proceeds from the event benefited the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater,[34] a non-profit organization founded by Seeger in 1966, to defend and restore the Hudson River. Seeger's 90th Birthday was also celebrated at The College of Staten Island on May 4.[35]On March 16, 2007, Pete Seeger, his sister Peggy, his brothers Mike and John, his wife Toshi, and other family members spoke and performed at a symposium and concert sponsored by the American Folklife Center in honor of the Seeger family, held at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.,[36] where Pete Seeger had been employed by the Archive of American Folk Song 67 years earlier.On September 29, 2008, the 89-year-old singer-activist, once banned from commercial TV, made a rare national TV appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, singing "Take It From Dr. King". In September 2008, Appleseed Recordings released At 89, Seeger's first studio album in 12 years. On September 19, Pete Seeger made his first appearance at the 52nd Monterey Jazz Festival, particularly notable because the Festival does not normally feature folk artists.On April 18, 2009, Pete Seeger performed in front of a small group of Earth Day celebrants at Teachers College in New York City. Among the songs he performed were "This Land is Your Land", "Take it From Dr. King", and "She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain".In 2010, still active at the age of 91, Seeger co-wrote and performed the song God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You with Lorre Wyatt, commenting on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[37]On October 21, 2011, at age 92, Pete Seeger was part of a solidarity march with Occupy Wall Street to Columbus Circle in New York City.[38] The march began with Seeger and fellow musicians exiting Symphony Space (95th and Broadway), where they had performed as part of a benefit for Seeger's Clearwater organization. Thousands of people crowded Pete Seeger by the time they reached Columbus Circle. Pete Seeger performed with his grandson, Tao Rodriguez-Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, David Amram, and other celebrated musicians.[39] The event, promoted under the name #OccupyTheCircle, was LiveStreamed, and dubbed by some as "The Pete Seeger March".He contributed a spoken version of Forever Young to the 2012 album Chimes of Freedom: Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International.On April 26, 2012, tens of thousands of Norwegians gathered in a show of unity at a rally in Oslo to sing Pete Seeger's song "My Rainbow Race" which a mass murderer had ridiculed as an example of "Marxist" brainwashing. The gunman was on trial for killing 77 people on July 22, 2011, insisting that his victims, who included 69 children, were traitors.[41] The song, which Seeger wrote in 1971 to protest the war in Vietnam, has long been a popular children's song in Norway. Its lyrics include the lines: "Some want to take the easy way / Poisons, bombs! They think we need 'em. / Don't they know you can't kill all the unbelievers. / There's no shortcut to freedom." Folksinger Lillebjrn Nilsen, author of the Norwegian version, led a crowd of over 40,000 in singing in both Norwegian and English. "I grew up with this song and have sung it to my child," said Lill Hjnnevg, one of the organizers of the demonstration." Another organizer, blogger Bagnhild Holms, said that although song might be Utopian, "the message is far from cheesy. [The killer] thinks we're brainwashed anyway, but it's important to show our distance. . . ." Culture ministers from Sweden, Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Iceland joined in the singing.[42] From the U.S. Pete Seeger voiced his support of the event.On July 18, 2012, Pete Seeger appeared at Bryant Park in New York City to sign copies of his new (2012) biography, "Pete Seeger: His Life in His Own Words," written with Rob Rosenthal and Sam Rosenthal. He also spoke about his life and career.On August 6, 2012, Pete Seeger appeared on the Colbert Report to speak with Stephen Colbert about his new book, "Pete Seeger: His Life in His Own Words," and also to perform "Quite Early Morning" on the banjo.[43]On Election Day, November 6, 2012, Pete Seeger released the music video and single of God's Counting on Me, God's Counting on You (Sloop Mix) produced live on the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater by Richard Barone and Matthew Billy. [1] [2]That same month it was announced he would perform, along with Harry Bellafonte, Jackson Browne and others, at a concert to bring awareness to the 37 year long ordeal of Native American Activist Leonard Peltier. The concert was to be held at the Beacon Theater in New York City that December.In 1936, at the age of 17, Pete Seeger joined the Young Communist League (YCL), then at the height of its popularity and influence. In 1942 he became a member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) itself. He eventually "drifted away" (his words) from the Party in the late 1940s and 1950s.[44]In the spring of 1941, the twenty-one-year-old Seeger performed as a member of the Almanac Singers along with Millard Lampell, Cisco Houston, Woody Guthrie, Butch and Bess Lomax Hawes, and Lee Hays. Seeger and the Almanacs cut several albums of 78s on Keynote and other labels, Songs for John Doe (recorded in late February or March and released in May 1941), the Talking Union, and an album each of sea chanteys and pioneer songs. Written by Millard Lampell, Songs for John Doe was performed by Lampell, Seeger, and Hays, joined by Josh White and Sam Gary. It contained lines such as, "It wouldn't be much thrill to die for Du Pont in Brazil," that were sharply critical of Roosevelt's unprecedented peacetime draft (enacted in September 1940). This anti-war/anti-draft tone reflected the Communist Party line after the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which maintained the war was "phony" and a mere pretext for big American corporations to get Hitler to attack Soviet Russia. Seeger has said he believed this line of argument at the timeas did many fellow members of the Young Communist League (YCL). Though nominally members of the Popular Front, which was allied with Roosevelt and more moderate liberals, the YCL's members still smarted from Roosevelt and Churchill's arms embargo to Loyalist Spain (which Roosevelt later called a mistake),[45] and the alliance frayed in the confusing welter of events.A June 16, 1941, review in Time magazine, which under its owner, Henry Luce, had become very interventionist, denounced the Almanacs' John Doe, accusing it of scrupulously echoing what it called "the mendacious Moscow tune" that "Franklin Roosevelt is leading an unwilling people into a J. P. Morgan war." Eleanor Roosevelt, a fan of folk music, reportedly found the album "in bad taste," though President Roosevelt, when the album was shown to him, merely observed, correctly as it turned out, that few people would ever hear it. More alarmist was the reaction of eminent German-born Harvard Professor of Government Carl Joachim Friedrich, an adviser on domestic propaganda to the US military. In a review in the June 1941 Atlantic Monthly, entitled "The Poison in Our System," he pronounced Songs for John Doe "...strictly subversive and illegal," "...whether Communist or Nazi financed," and "a matter for the attorney general," observing further that "mere" legal "suppression" would not be sufficient to counteract this type of populist poison,[46] the poison being folk music, and the ease with which it could be spread.[47]At that point, the U.S. had not yet entered the war but was energetically re-arming. African Americans were barred from working in defense plants, a situation that greatly angered both African Americans and white progressives. Black union leaders A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and A. J. Muste began planning a huge march on Washington to protest racial discrimination in war industries and to urge desegregation of the armed forces. The march, which many regard as the first manifestation of the Civil Rights Movement, was canceled after President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 (The Fair Employment Act) of June 25, 1941, barring discrimination in hiring by companies holding federal contracts for defense work. This Presidential act defused black anger considerably, although the US army still refused to desegregate, declining to participate in what it called "social engineering."Roosevelt's order came three days after Hitler broke the non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union. The Communist Party now immediately directed its members to get behind the draft, and it also forbade participation in strikes for the duration of the war (angering some leftists). Copies of Songs for John Doe were removed from sale, and the remaining inventory destroyed, though a few copies may exist in the hands of private collectors.[48] The Almanac Singers' Talking Union album, on the other hand, was reissued as an LP by Folkways (FH 5285A) in 1955 and is still available. The following year the Almanacs issued Dear Mr. President, an album in support of Roosevelt and the war effort. The title song, "Dear Mr. President," was a solo by Pete Seeger, and its lines expressed his lifelong credo:Now, Mr. President, / We haven't always agreed in the past, I know, / But that ain't at all important now. / What is important is what we got to do, / We got to lick Mr. Hitler, and until we do, / Other things can wait.//Now, as I think of our great land . . . / I know it ain't perfect, but it will be someday, / Just give us a little time. // This is the reason that I want to fight, / Not 'cause everything's perfect, or everything's right. / No, it's just the opposite: I'm fightin' because / I want a better America, and better laws, / And better homes, and jobs, and schools, / And no more Jim Crow, and no more rules like / "You can't ride on this train 'cause you're a Negro," / "You can't live here 'cause you're a Jew,"/ "You can't work here 'cause you're a union man."//So, Mr. President, / We got this one big job to do / That's lick Mr. Hitler and when we're through, / Let no one else ever take his place / To trample down the human race. / So what I want is you to give me a gun / So we can hurry up and get the job done.Seeger's critics, however, have continued to bring up the Almanacs' repudiated Songs for John Doe. In 1942, a year after the John Doe album's brief appearance (and disappearance), the FBI decided that the now-pro-war Almanacs were still endangering the war effort by subverting recruitment. According to the New York World Telegram (February 14, 1942), Carl Friedrich's 1941 article "The Poison in Our System" was printed up as a pamphlet and distributed by the Council for Democracy (an organization that Friedrich and Henry Luce's right hand man, C. D. Jackson, Vice President of Time magazine, had founded "...to combat all the nazi, fascist, communist, pacifist..." antiwar groups in the United States).[49] and was shown to the Almanac's employers in order to keep them off the air. Coincidentally, defamatory reviews and gossip items appeared in New York newspapers whenever they performed in public, and ultimately the Almanacs had to disband.[50]Seeger served in the US Army in the Pacific. He was trained as an airplane mechanic, but was reassigned to entertain the American troops with music. Later, when people asked him what he did in the war, he always answered "I strummed my banjo." After returning from service, Seeger and others established People's Songs, conceived as a nationwide organization with branches on both coasts and designed to "Create, promote and distribute songs of labor and the American People"[51] With Pete Seeger as its director, People's Songs worked for the 1948 presidential campaign of Roosevelt's former Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President, Henry A. Wallace, who ran as a third-party candidate on the Progressive Party ticket. Despite having attracted enormous crowds nationwide, however, Wallace won only in New York City, and, in the red-baiting frenzy that followed, he was excoriated (as Roosevelt had not been) for accepting the help in his campaign of Communists and fellow travelers such as Seeger and singer Paul Robeson.[52]Seeger had been a fervent supporter of the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. In 1943, with Tom Glazer and Bess and Baldwin Hawes, he recorded an album of 78s called Songs of the Lincoln Battalion on Moe Asch's Stinson label. This included such songs as "There's a Valley in Spain called Jarama," and "Viva la Quinta Brigada." In 1960, this collection was re-issued by Moe Asch as one side of a Folkways LP called Songs of the Lincoln and International Brigades. On the other side was a reissue of the legendary Six Songs for Democracy (originally recorded in Barcelona in 1938 while bombs were falling), performed by Ernst Busch and a chorus of members of the Thlmann Battalion, made up of refugees from Nazi Germany. The songs were: "Moorsoldaten" ("Peat Bog Soldiers", composed by political prisoners of German concentration camps), "Die Thaelmann-Kolonne," "Hans Beimler," "Das Lied Von Der Einheitsfront" ("Song of The United Front" by Hanns Eisler and Bertolt Brecht), "Der Internationalen Brigaden" ("Song Of The International Brigades"), and "Los cuatro generales" ("The Four Generals," known in English as "The Four Insurgent Generals").In the 1950s and, indeed, consistently throughout his life, Seeger continued his support of civil and labor rights, racial equality, international understanding, and anti-militarism (all of which had characterized the Wallace campaign) and he continued to believe that songs could help people achieve these goals. With the ever-growing revelations of Joseph Stalin's atrocities and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, however, he became increasingly disillusioned with Soviet Communism. In his PBS biography, Seeger said he "drifted away" from the CPUSA beginning in 1949 but remained friends with some who did not leave it, though he argued with them about it.[53][54]On August 18, 1955, Seeger was subpoenaed to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Alone among the many witnesses after the 1950 conviction and imprisonment of the Hollywood Ten for contempt of Congress, Seeger refused to plead the Fifth Amendment (which asserted that his testimony might be self incriminating) and instead (as the Hollywood Ten had done) refused to name personal and political associations on the grounds that this would violate his First Amendment rights: "I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this."[55] Seeger's refusal to testify led to a March 26, 1957, indictment for contempt of Congress; for some years, he had to keep the federal government apprised of where he was going any time he left the Southern District of New York. He was convicted in a jury trial of contempt of Congress in March 1961, and sentenced to 10 years in jail (to be served simultaneously), but in May 1962 an appeals court ruled the indictment to be flawed and overturned his conviction.[56][57]In 1960, the San Diego school board told him that he could not play a scheduled concert at a high school unless he signed an oath pledging that the concert would not be used to promote a communist agenda or an overthrow of the government. Seeger refused, and the American Civil Liberties Union obtained an injunction against the school district, allowing the concert to go on as scheduled. In February 2009, the San Diego School District officially extended an apology to Seeger for the actions of their predecessors.[58]A longstanding opponent of the arms race and of the Vietnam War, Seeger satirically attacked then-President Lyndon Johnson with his 1966 recording, on the album Dangerous Songs!?, of Len Chandler's children's song, "Beans in My Ears". Beyond Chandler's lyrics, Seeger said that "Mrs. Jay's little son Alby" had "beans in his ears," which, as the lyrics imply,[59] ensures that a person does not hear what is said to them. To those opposed to continuing the Vietnam War, the phrase implied that "Alby Jay" was a loose pronunciation of Johnson's nickname "LBJ," and sarcastically suggested "that must explain why he doesn't respond to the protests against his war policies."[citation needed]Seeger attracted wider attention starting in 1967 with his song "Waist Deep in the Big Muddy", about a captainreferred to in the lyrics as "the big fool"who drowned while leading a platoon on maneuvers in Louisiana during World War II. In the face of arguments with the management of CBS about whether the song's political weight was in keeping with the usually light-hearted entertainment of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, the final lines were "Every time I read the paper/those old feelings come on/We are waist deep in the Big Muddy and the big fool says to push on." The lyrics could be interpreted as an allegory of Johnson as the "big fool" and the Vietnam War as the foreseeable danger. Although the performance was cut from the September 1967 show,[60] after wide publicity[61] it was broadcast when Seeger appeared again on the Smothers' Brothers show in the following January.[62]Inspired by Woody Guthrie, whose guitar was labeled "This machine kills fascists",photo Seeger's banjo was emblazoned with the motto "This Machine Surrounds Hate and Forces It to Surrender.[63]In the documentary film The Power of Song, Seeger mentions that he and his family visited North Vietnam in 1972.[64]Seeger is involved in the environmental organization Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, which he co-founded in 1966. This organization has worked since then to highlight pollution in the Hudson River and worked to clean it. As part of that effort, the sloop Clearwater was launched in 1969 with its inaugural sail down from Maine to South Street Seaport Museum in New York City, and thence to the Hudson River.[65] Amongst the inaugural crew was Don McLean, who co-edited the book Songs and Sketches of the First Clearwater Crew, with sketches by Thomas B. Allen for which Seeger wrote the foreword.[66] Seeger and McLean sang "Shenandoah" on the 1974 Clearwater album. The sloop regularly sails the river with volunteer and professional crew members, primarily conducting environmental education programs for school groups. The Great Hudson River Revival (aka Clearwater Festival) is an annual two-day music festival held on the banks of the Hudson at Croton Point Park. This festival grew out of early fundraising concerts arranged by Seeger and friends to raise money to pay for Clearwater's construction.Seeger wrote and performed "That Lonesome Valley" about the then-polluted Hudson River in 1969, and his band members also wrote and performed songs commemorating the Clearwater.The 106-foot-long sailboat, Clearwater, was built to conduct science-based environmental education aboard the sailing ship. Clearwater has education programs with many colleges and institutions, including SUNY New Paltz, and Pace University. The sail ship has become recognized for its role in the environmental movement. The Clearwater Festival brings Hudson Valley residents together to enjoy music, their cultural heritage, and support a cause.[67]To earn money during the blacklist period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger had gigs as a music teacher in schools and summer camps and traveled the college campus circuit. He also recorded as many as five albums a year for Moe Asch's Folkways Records label. As the nuclear disarmament movement picked up steam in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Seeger's anti-war songs, such as, "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" (co-written with Joe Hickerson), "Turn, Turn, Turn", adapted from the Book of Ecclesiastes, and "The Bells of Rhymney" by the Welsh poet Idris Davies[68] (1957), gained wide currency. Seeger also was closely associated with the 1960s Civil Rights movement and in 1963 helped organize a landmark Carnegie Hall Concert, featuring the youthful Freedom Singers, as a benefit for the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee. This event and Martin Luther King's March on Washington in August of that year, in which Seeger and other folk singers participated, brought the Civil Rights anthem "We Shall Overcome" to wide audiences. A version of this song, submitted by Zilphia Horton of Highlander, had been published in Seeger's People's Songs Bulletin as early as in 1947.By this time Seeger was a senior figure in the 1960s folk revival centered in Greenwich Village, as a longtime columnist in Sing Out!, the successor to the People's Songs Bulletin, and as a founder of the topical Broadside magazine. To describe the new crop of politically committed folk singers, he coined the phrase "Woody's children", alluding to his associate and traveling companion, Woody Guthrie, who by this time had become a legendary figure. This urban folk-revival movement, a continuation of the activist tradition of the 1930s and 1940s and of People's Songs, used adaptations of traditional tunes and lyrics to effect social change, a practice that goes back to the Industrial Workers of the World or Wobblies' Little Red Song Book, compiled by Swedish-born union organizer Joe Hill (18791915). (The Little Red Song Book had been a favorite of Woody Guthrie's, who was known to carry it around.)Pete Seeger toured Australia in 1963. His single "Little Boxes", written by Malvina Reynolds, was number one in the nation's Top 40s. That tour sparked a folk boom throughout the country at a time when post Kennedy assassination popular musical tastes competed between folk, the surfing craze and the British rock boom which gave the world The Beatles, The Rolling Stones among others. Folk clubs sprung up all over the nation, folk performers were accepted in established venues and Australian performers singing Australian folk songs many of their own composing, emerged in concert and festivals, on television and on recordings and overseas performers were encouraged to tour Australia. In 1993 the Australian singer/playwright Maurie Mulheron assembled a musical biography of Seeger's, and friends', work in a stage production One Word ... WE!. It enjoyed a long and sold-out season at the New Theatre in the inner Sydney suburb of Newtown. It was reprised in 2000 and most recently at the Tom Mann Theatre, a Trade Union-owned and operated theatre in Surry Hills, also in inner Sydney, on 12, 13 and 14 June 2009. 2009, and the company has also taken the show on tour to folk festivals at Maleny and Woodford in Queensland, and Port Fairy in Victoria. Mulheron was its Musical Director and it was directed by Frank Barnes.A DVD of Seeger's 1963 Melbourne Town Hall concert has been released by The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). It is an historical document in black and white and is well worth owning. The Sydney-based instrumental and vocal ensemble Loosely Woven based at Humph Hall on the Northern Beaches of Sydney, showcased Seeger's work and times in one of its 2009 seasons, to celebrate the Pete Seeger ninetieth birthday. Loosely Woven's Artistic Director Wayne Richmond and his new wife Gial, attended the 2011 Clearwater Festival and met Pete Seeger..The long television blacklist of Seeger began to end in the mid-1960s when he hosted a regionally broadcast, educational folk-music television show, Rainbow Quest. Among his guests were Johnny Cash, June Carter, Reverend Gary Davis, Mississippi John Hurt, Doc Watson, The Stanley Brothers, Elizabeth Cotten, Patrick Sky, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Tom Paxton, Judy Collins, Donovan, Richard Faria and Mimi Faria, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, Mamou Cajun Band, Bernice Johnson Reagon, The Beers Family, Roscoe Holcomb, Malvina Reynolds, and Shawn Phillips. Thirty-nine[53] hour-long programs were recorded at WNJU's Newark studios in 1965 and 1966, produced by Seeger and his wife Toshi, with Sholom Rubinstein. The Smothers Brothers ended Seeger's national blacklisting by broadcasting him singing "Waist Deep in the Big Muddy" on their CBS variety show on February 25, 1968, after his similar performance in September 1967 was censored by CBS.[69]In November 1976 Seeger wrote and recorded the anti-death penalty song "Delbert Tibbs" about then death-row inmate Delbert Tibbs, who was later exonerated. Seeger wrote the music and selected the words from poems written by Tibbs.[70]Pete Seeger was one of the earliest backers of Bob Dylan and was responsible for urging John Hammond to produce Dylan's first LP on Columbia and for inviting him to perform at the Newport Folk Festival, of which Seeger was a board member.[71] There was a widely repeated story that Seeger was so upset over the extremely loud amplified sound that Dylan, backed by members of the Butterfield Blues Band, brought into the 1965 Newport Folk Festival that he threatened to disconnect the equipment. There are multiple versions of what went on, some fanciful. What is certain is that tensions had been running high between Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman and Festival Board members (who besides Seeger also included Theodore Bikel, Bruce Jackson, Alan Lomax, festival MC Peter Yarrow, and George Wein) over the scheduling of performers and other matters. Two days earlier there had been a scuffle and brief exchange of blows between Grossman and Alan Lomax; and the Board, in an emergency session, had voted to ban Grossman from the grounds, but had backed off when George Wein pointed out that Grossman also managed highly popular draws Odetta and Peter, Paul, and Mary.[72] Seeger has been portrayed as a folk "purist" who was one of the main opponents to Dylan's "going electric".[73] but when asked in 2001 about how he recalled his "objections" to the electric style, he said:I couldn't understand the words. I wanted to hear the words. It was a great song, "Maggie's Farm," and the sound was distorted. I ran over to the guy at the controls and shouted, "Fix the sound so you can hear the words." He hollered back, "This is the way they want it." I said "Damn it, if I had an axe, I'd cut the cable right now." But I was at fault. I was the MC, and I could have said to the part of the crowd that booed Bob, "you didn't boo Howlin' Wolf yesterday. He was electric!" Though I still prefer to hear Dylan acoustic, some of his electric songs are absolutely great. Electric music is the vernacular of the second half of the twentieth century, to use my father's old term.[74]In 1982 Seeger performed at a benefit concert for Poland's Solidarity resistance movement. His biographer David Dunaway considers this the first public manifestation of Seeger's decades-long personal dislike of communism in its Soviet form.[75] In the late 1980s Seeger also expressed disapproval of violent revolutions, remarking to an interviewer that he was really in favor of incremental change and that "the most lasting revolutions are those that take place over a period of time."[75] In his autobiography Where Have All the Flowers Gone (1993 and 1997 reissued in 2009), Seeger wrote, "Should I apologize for all this? I think so." He went on to put his thinking in context:How could Hitler have been stopped? Litvinov, the Soviet delegate to the League of Nations in '36, proposed a worldwide quarantine but got no takers. For more on those times check out pacifist Dave Dellinger's book, From Yale to Jail....[76] At any rate, today I'll apologize for a number of things, such as thinking that Stalin was merely a "hard driver" and not a "supremely cruel misleader." I guess anyone who calls himself a Christian should be prepared to apologize for the Inquisition, the burning of heretics by Protestants, the slaughter of Jews and Muslims by Crusaders. White people in the U.S.A ought to apologize for stealing land from Native Americans and enslaving blacks. Europeans could apologize for worldwide conquests, Mongolians for Genghis Khan. And supporters of Roosevelt could apologize for his support of Somoza, of Southern White Democrats, of Franco Spain, for putting Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Who should my granddaughter Moraya apologize to? She's part African, part European, part Chinese, part Japanese, part Native American. Let's look ahead.[77][78]In a 1995 interview, however, he insisted that "I still call myself a communist, because communism is no more what Russia made of it than Christianity is what the churches make of it."[79] In recent years, as the aging Seeger began to garner awards and recognition for his lifelong activism, he also found himself attacked once again for his opinions and associations of the 1930s and 1940s. In 2006, David BoazVoice of America and NPR commentator and president of the libertarian Cato Institutewrote an opinion piece in The Guardian, entitled "Stalin's Songbird" in which he excoriated The New Yorker and The New York Times for lauding Seeger. He characterized Seeger as "someone with a longtime habit of following the party line" who had only "eventually" parted ways with the CPUSA. In support of this view, he quoted lines from the Almanac Singers' May 1941 Songs for John Doe, contrasting them darkly with lines supporting the war from Dear Mr. President, issued in 1942, after the USA and the USSR had entered the war.[80][81]In 2007, in response to criticism from a former banjo studenthistorian Ron Radosh, a former Trotskyite who now writes for the conservative National ReviewSeeger wrote a song condemning Stalin, "Big Joe Blues":[82] "I'm singing about old Joe, cruel Joe. / He ruled with an iron hand. /He put an end to the dreams / Of so many in every land. / He had a chance to make / A brand new start for the human race. / Instead he set it back / Right in the same nasty place. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / Keep your mouth shut or you will die fast. / I got the Big Joe Blues. / Do this job, no questions asked. / I got the Big Joe Blues."[83] The song was accompanied by a letter to Radosh, in which Seeger stated, "I think youre right, I should have asked to see the gulags when I was in U.S.S.R [in 1965]."[78][85][86]In 1998 Appleseed Records issued a double-CD tribute album: Where Have All the Flowers Gone: the Songs of Pete Seeger, which included readings by Studs Terkel and songs by Billy Bragg, Jackson Browne, Eliza Carthy, Judy Collins, Bruce Cockburn, Donovan, Ani DiFranco, Dick Gaughan, Nanci Griffith, Richie Havens, Indigo Girls, Roger McGuinn, Holly Near, Odetta, Tom Paxton, Bonnie Raitt, Martin Simpson, and Bruce Springsteen, among others.In 2001, Appleseed release "If I Had a Song: The Songs of Pete Seeger, Vol. 2." In 2003, it issued the double-CD Seeds: The Songs of Pete Seeger, Volume 3, the final set in its trilogy of releases celebrating Seeger's music.In April 2006 Bruce Springsteen released a collection of folk songs associated with Seeger's repertoire, titled, We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (which contained no songs actually composed by Seeger). Springsteen and his band also toured to sellout crowds in a series of concerts based on those sessions. He had previously performed the Seeger staple, "We Shall Overcome", on Where Have All the Flowers Gone.In the 1970s Harry Chapin released a song dedicated to Seeger called "Old Folkie".Seeger has been the recipient of many awards and recognitions throughout his career, including:Jim Musselman (founder of Appleseed Recordings), longtime friend and record producer for Pete Seeger:Raffi on his concert video "Raffi on Broadway" during the introduction of May There Always Be Sunshine:"And this song is the one that I first heard Pete Seeger singing. And he tells me that it was written by a four-year-old boy in Russia. And it's just got four lines and it's been translated into a number of languages."1 Family and personal life2 Musical career

Gheorghe I. Ttrescu (also known as Gu Ttrescu, with a slightly antiquated pet form of his given name; 2 November 1886  28 March 1957) was a Romanian politician who served twice as Prime Minister of Romania (19341937; 19391940), three times as Minister of Foreign Affairs (interim in 1934 and 1938; appointed to the office in 1945-1947), and once as Minister of War (1934). Representing the "young liberals" faction inside the National Liberal Party (PNL), Ttrescu began his political career as a collaborator of Ion G. Duca, becoming noted for his anti-Communism and, in time, for his conflicts with the PNL's leader Dinu Brtianu and the Foreign Minister Nicolae Titulescu. During his first time in office, he moved closer to King Carol II, leading an ambivalent policy toward the fascist Iron Guard and ultimately becoming instrumental in establishing the authoritarian and corporatist regime around the National Renaissance Front. In 1940, he accepted the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union, and consequently had to resign.After the start of World War II, Gheorghe Ttrescu initiated a move to rally political forces in opposition to Ion Antonescu's dictatorship, and sought an alliance with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). He was twice expelled from the PNL, in 1938 and 1944, creating instead his own group, the National Liberal Party-Ttrescu, and representing it inside the Communist-endorsed Petru Groza cabinet. In 1946-1947, he was also the President of the Romanian Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris. After that moment, relations between Ttrescu and the PCR began to sour, and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and the Foreign Ministry when his name was implicated in the Tmdu Affair. Following the Communist takeover, he was arrested and held as a political prisoner, while being called to testify in the trial of Lucreiu Ptrcanu. He died soon after his release from prison.Elected an honorary member of the Romanian Academy in 1937, he was removed from his seat by the Communist authorities in 1948.[1] One of his brothers, Colonel tefan Ttrescu, was at some point the leader of a minor Nazi group, the National Socialist Party.Born in Trgu Jiu, Ttrescu studied at Carol I High School in Craiova. He later went to France, where he was awarded a doctorate from the University of Paris in 1912, with a thesis on the Romanian parliamentary system (Le rgime lectoral et parlementaire en Roumanie).[1] He subsequently worked as a lawyer in Bucharest. He fathered a son, Tudor, and a daughter, Sanda (married to the lawyer Ulise Negropontes in 1940).[2]After joining the National Liberal Party (PNL), he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in November 1919, representing Gorj County.[3] Among his first notable actions as a politician was an initiative to interpellate Nicolae L. Lupu, the Minister of Interior Affairs Ministry in the Romanian National Party-Peasants' Party cabinet, in answer to concerns that the executive was tolerating socialist agitation in the countryside.[4]He stood among the PNL's "young liberals" faction (as they were colloquially known), supporting free trade and a more authoritarian rule over the country around King Carol II, and opposing both the older generation of leaders (who tended to advocate protectionism and a liberal democracy) and the dissident group of Gheorghe I. Brtianu (see National Liberal Party-Brtianu).[5]Undersecretary in the Interior Affairs Ministry under several PNL cabinets (beginning with that of Ion I. C. Brtianu in 1922-1926), he first became noted as a collaborator of Ion G. Duca. In 1924-1936, in contrast to his post-World War II agenda, Ttrescu was a noted anti-communist, and reacted vehemently against the Romanian Communist Party (PCdR, later PCR)[6]  recommending and obtaining its outlawing, based on Communist adversity to the concept of Greater Romania, and notably arguing that the Comintern-supported Tatarbunary Uprising was evidence of "imperialist communism".[7]Ttrescu became leader of the cabinet in January 1934, as the fascist Iron Guard had assassinated Prime Minister Duca on 30 December 1933 (the five-day premiership of Constantin Anghelescu ensured transition between the two governments). His was the second PNL cabinet formed during Carol's reign, and the latter's failure to draw support from the mainstream group led to a tight connection being established between Carol and the young liberals, with Ttrescu backing the process leading to the creation of a royal dictatorship.[8] One of Ttrescu's first measures was a decisive move to end the conflict between the National Liberal executive and the Mayor of Bucharest, Dem I. Dobrescu (who was backed by the National Peasants' Party)  making use of his prerogative, he removed Dobrescu from office on 18 January.[9]The brief period constituted a reference point in Romanian economy, as the emergence from the Great Depression, although marked by endemic problems, saw prosperity more widespread than ever before.[10] This was, in part, the contribution of new economic relations which Ttrescu defended and encouraged: the state transformed itself into the main agent of economic activities, allowing for prosperous businesses to benefit from its demands, and, in time, leading to the creation of a camarilla dominated by the figures of industrialists such as Aristide Blank, Nicolae Malaxa, and Max Auschnitt.[11] In this context, Ttrescu's allegedly subservient position in front of Carol was a frequent topic of ridicule at the time.[12] According to a hostile account of the socialist Petre Pandrea:"Ttrescu was ceremonious in order to cover his menial nature. When he was leaving audiences [with the King], he pressed forward on the small of his back and returned facing backwards from the desk to the door, not daring to show his back. [...] Watching over the scene [...], Carol II exclaimed to his intimate assistants:
 I don't have a big enough tooshie for all the politicians to kiss!"[13]Among other services rendered, he intervened in the conflict between Carol and his brother, Prince Nicholas, asking the latter to renounce either his marriage to Ioana Dumitrescu-Doletti  considered a misalliance by Carol, it had not been recognized by Romanian authorities  or his princely prerogatives.[14] Nicholas chose the latter alternative in 1937.[14]Inside his party, Ttrescu lost ground to Dinu Brtianu, elected by the traditional Liberal elite as a compromise in order to ensure unity; upon his election in 1934, the latter stated:"This time as well, I would have gladly conceded, if I were to believe that anyone else in the party could gather voter unanimity."[15]The issue remained debated for the following two years. The party congress of July 1936 eventually elected Ttrescu to the second position in the party, that of general secretary.[16]In his foreign policy, Prime Minister Ttrescu balanced two different priorities, attempting to strengthen the traditional military alliance with Poland which was aimed at the Soviet Union, and reacting against the growing regional influence of Nazi Germany by maintaining the relevancy of the Little Entente and establishing further contacts with the Soviets.In August 1936, he removed Nicolae Titulescu from the office of Foreign Minister, replacing him with Victor Antonescu. This caused an uproar, with most of Romania's diplomatic corps voicing their dissatisfaction. Over the following months, virtually all of Titulescu's supporters were themselves recalled (including, among others, Constantin Vioianu, the ambassador to Poland, Constantin Antoniade, Romania's representative to the League of Nations, Dimitrie Ghyka, the ambassador to Belgium, and Caius Brediceanu, the ambassador to Austria) while Titulescu's adversaries, such as Antoine Bibesco, were returned to office.[17] Bibesco subsequently campaigned in France and the United Kingdom, in an attempt to reassure Romania's main allies that the move did not signify a change in Romania's priorities.[18] Ttrescu was later blamed by his own party for having renounced the diplomatic course on which Romania had engaged.[19]In early 1937, Ttrescu rejected the proposal of Jzef Beck, Poland's Minister of Foreign Affairs, to withdraw Romania's support for Czechoslovakia and attempt a reconciliation with Hungary (the following year, Romania withdrew its support for the former, indicating, just before the Munich Agreement, that it was not in a position to guarantee Czechoslovakia's frontiers).[20] This was accompanied by Czechoslovak initiatives to establish close contacts between the Little Entente and the Soviets: a scandal erupted in the same year, when the country's ambassador to Romania, Jan eba, published a volume calling for Soviet-Entente military cooperation (despite the Soviet-Romanian conflict over Bessarabia) and expressing the hope that the Soviet state would extend its borders into Western Byelorussia and Ukraine.[21] Kamil Krofta, Czechoslovakia's Foreign Minister, received criticism for having prefaced the book, and, after Ttrescu paid a visit to Czechoslovak Prime Minister Milan Hoda, eba was recalled to Prague.[21]In combating the Iron Guard, Ttrescu chose to relax virtually all pressures on the latter (while mimicking some of its messages), and instead concentrated again on curbing the activities of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) and outlawing its Popular Front-type organizations (see Amicii URSS).[22]In April 1936, he and the Minister of the Interior Ion Incule allowed the a youth congress to gather in Trgu Mure, aware of the fact that it was masking a fascist gathering; delegates to the congress, traveling in a special train commissioned by the government, vandalized Ion Duca's memorial plate in Sinaia train station, and, upon their arrival in Trgu Mure, made public their violent anti-Semitic agenda.[23] It was probably there that death squads were designated and assigned missions, leading to the murder of Mihai Stelescu, a former associate, in June of the next year.[24]In February 1937, an intense publicity campaign by the Guard, begun with the ostentatious funerals of Ion Moa and Vasile Marin (killed in the Spanish Civil War) and culminating in the physical assaulting of Traian Bratu, rector of the University of Iai, by Guardist students, provoked the premier's order to close down universities throughout the country.[25]Later in that year, the collaboration between monarch and premier, coupled with the fact that Ttrescu had successfully attracted nationalist votes from the Iron Guard, led to the signing of an electoral agreement between the latter, the National Peasants' Party (the main democratic opposition group), and the National Liberal Party-Brtianu  the pact was meant to prevent all attempt by Carol to manipulate the votes in elections.[26] (A secondary and unexpected development was that the illegal PCR, which had decided to back the National Peasants' Party prior to the elections, eventually supported the electoral pact.)[27] Ttrescu's own alliance policy rose the anger of his opponents inside the PNL, as he signed collaboration agreements with the fascist Romanian Front and German Party.[16]The 1937 elections led to an unprecedented situation: although the PNL and Ttrescu had gained the largest percentage of the vote (almost 36%), they fell short of being awarded majority bonus (granted at 40% of the vote).[28] As the far right had gathered momentum (the Guard, running under the name of "Everything for the Fatherland Party", had obtained 15.6 of the vote),[29] Carol was faced with the threat of an Iron Guard government, which would have been one deeply opposed to all of his political principles: he called on a third party, Octavian Goga's National Christian Party (coming from the anti-Semitic far right but deeply opposed to the Guard) to form a new cabinet in December of that year.[30]Consequently, Ttrescu renounced his offices inside the party, and, while keeping his office of general secretary, he was surpassed by the readmitted Gheorghe I. Brtianu  who was elected to the new office of PNL vice president on 10 January 1938.[16] After the failure of Goga's policies to curb the rise of their competitors, the king, backed by Ttrescu, resorted to dissolving all political parties on 30 May 1938, creating instead the National Renaissance Front.[31]In this context, Ttrescu chose to back the regime, as the PNL, like the National Peasants' Party, remained active in nominal clandestinity (as the law banning it had never been enforced any further).[32] Having personally signed the document banning opposition parties, he was expelled from the PNL in April 1938, and contested the legitimacy of the action for the following years.[33] Allegedly, his ousting was recommended by Iuliu Maniu, leader of the National Peasants' Party's and, for the following years, the closest of Dinu Brtianu's political allies.[33]Soon after his second arrival to power, Ttrescu became noted for the enthusiastic support he gave to the modernist sculptor Constantin Brncui, and directed state funds to finance the building of Brancusi's The Endless Column complex in Trgu Jiu (completed in October 1938).[1]Alongside Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu (whom he succeeded as Premier), Ttrescu became a dominant figure in the group of maverick pro-Carol politicians.[34] After a bloody crackdown on the Iron Guard, the Front attempted to reunite political forces in a national government that was to back Carol's foreign policies in view of increasing threats on Romania's borders after the outbreak of World War II. In 1945, Ttrescu stressed his belief that authoritarianism benefited Romania, and supported the view that Carol had meant to keep Romania out of the war.[35] Ttrescu's second cabinet was meant to reflect the latter policies, but it did not draw any support from traditional parties,[36] and, in April 1940, Carol, assisted by Ernest Urdreanu and Mihail Ghelmegeanu, began talks with the (by then much weaker) Iron Guard.[37]Ttrescu remained in office throughout the rest of the Phony War, until the fall of France, and his cabinet signed an economic agreement with Nazi Germany (through which virtually all Romanian exports were directed towards the latter country)[38] and saw the crumbling of Romania's alliance with the United Kingdom and France.[39] The cabinet was brought down by the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union (effects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact), as well as by Carol's attempt to appease German hostility by dissolving it, replacing Ttrescu with Ion Gigurtu, and recreating the Front as the totalitarian Party of the Nation.[40]After the Second Vienna Award (when Northern Transylvania was lost to Hungary), confirming Carol's failure to preserve both the country's neutrality and its territorial integrity, Romania was taken over by an Iron Guard dictatorial government (the National Legionary State). Speaking five years later, Dinu Brtianu placed the blame for the serious developments on Ttrescu's own actions, addressing him directly:"I remind you: [...] you have contributed directly, in 1940, in steering the country towards a foreign policy that, as one could tell even then, was to prove ill-fated and which led us to the loathsome Vienna settlement, one which you have supported inside the Crown Council [...]."[41]On 26 November 1940, the Iron Guard began a bloody retaliation against various political figures who had served under Carol (following a late investigation into the 1938 killing of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the movement's founder and early leader, by Carol's authorities). Ttrescu and Constantin Argetoianu were among the second wave of captured politicians (on 27 November), and were destined for arbitrary execution; they were, however, saved by the intervention of regular police forces, most of whom had grown hostile to the Guardist militias.[42]Retired from political life during the war, he was initially sympathetic to Ion Antonescu's pro-German dictatorship (see Romania during World War II)  Dinu Brtianu, who remained in opposition to the Antonescu regime, made mention an official visit to Bessarabia, recovered after the start of Operation Barbarossa, when Ttrescu had accompanied Antonescu, "thus making common cause with his warmongering action".[41] At the time, his daughter Sandra Ttrescu Negropontes worked as an ambulance driver for the Romanian Red Cross.[2]In the end, Ttrescu became involved in negotiations aimed at withdrawing Romania from the conflict, and, while beginning talks with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), tried to build foreign connections to support Romania's cause following the inevitable defeat; he thus corresponded with Edvard Bene, leader of the Czechoslovak government in exile in England.[43] Bene, who had already been discussing matters involving Romania with Richard Franasovici and Grigore Gafencu, and had agreed to support the Romanian cause, informed the Allied governments of Ttrescu's designs.[43]Ttrescu later contrasted his diplomatic approach with the strategy of Barbu tirbey (who had only attempted an agreement with the Western Allies in Cairo, instead of opening relations with the Soviets).[35] Initially meeting with the refusal of Iuliu Maniu and Dinu Brtianu (who decided to invest their trust in tirbey), he was relatively successful after the Cairo initiative proved fruitless: the two traditional parties accepted collaboration with the bloc formed by the PCR, the Romanian Social Democratic Party, the Ploughmen's Front, and the Socialist Peasants' Party, leading to the formation of the short-lived and unstable National Democratic Bloc (BND) in June 1944.[43] It overthrew Antonescu in August, by means of the successful King Michael Coup.Ttrescu returned to the PNL later in 1944  after the Soviet Red Army had entered Romania and the country had become an Allied state, political parties were again allowed to register. Nevertheless, Ttrescu was again opposed to the party leaders Dinu and Gheorghe I. Brtianu, and split to form his own group in June-July 1945.[44] Dinu Brtianu convened the PNL leadership and formally excluded Ttrescu and his partisans, citing their support for dictatorial regimes.[19]As the PCR, which was growing more influent (with the backing of Soviet occupation) while generally lacking popular appeal, sought to form alliances with various forces in order to increase its backing, Ttrescu declared his group to be left-wing and Social liberal, while attempting to preserve a middle course in the new political setting, by pleading for close relations to be maintained with both the Soviet Union and the Western Allies.[45] N. D. Cocea, a prominent socialist who had joined the PNL, represented the faction in talks for an alliance with the Communists.[46] The agreement, favored by Ana Pauker, was vehemently opposed by another member of the Communist leadership, Lucreiu Ptrcanu, who argued in favor of "making a distinction inside the bourgeoisie",[47] and collaborating with the main PNL, while calling Ttrescu's faction "a gang of con artists, blackmailers, and well-known bribers".[48]Ttrescu became Foreign Minister and vice president of the government in the cabinet of Petru Groza when the latter came into office after Soviet pressures in 1945; his faction had been awarded leadership of four other ministries  Finance, with three successive office-holders (of whom the last was Alexandru Alexandrini), Public Works, with Gheorghe Vntu,[49] Industry (with Petre N. Bejan), and Religious Affairs, with Radu Rocule. He indirectly helped the PCR carry out an electoral fraud during the general election in 1946 by failing to reply to American proposals for organizing fair elections.[50] At the Paris Conference,[51] where he was accompanied by the PCR leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Ptrcanu, he acknowledged the dissolution of Greater Romania under the provisions of the new Treaty (1947).[52]Tensions between his group with the PCR occurred when the former founded itself as a party under the name of National-Liberal Party (commonly known as the National Liberal Party-Ttrescu), and, in June-July 1945, proclaimed its goal to be the preservation of property and a middle class under a new regime.[53] Of himself and his principles, Ttrescu stated:"I am not a communist. Taking in view my attitudes towards mankind, society, property, I am not a communist. Thus, the new orientation in external politics which I demand for my country cannot be accused of being determined by affinities or sympathies of doctrine."[54]Speaking in retrospect, Gheorghiu-Dej indicated the actual relation between his party and Ttrescu's: "we have had to tolerate by our side a capitalist-gentry political group, Ttrescu's group".[55]Ttrescu himself continued to show his support for several PCR policies: in the summer of 1947, he condemned the United States for having protested against the repression of forces in the opposition.[56] Nevertheless, at around the same time, he issued his own critique of the Groza government, becoming the target of violent attacks initiated by Miron Constantinescu in the PCR press.[57] Consequently, he was singled out for negligence in office when, during the kangaroo trial of Iuliu Maniu (see Tmdu Affair), it was alleged that several employees of his ministry had conspired against the government.[58] Scnteia, the official voice of the PCR, wrote of all National Liberal Party-Ttrescu offices in the government: "The rot is all-encompassing! It has to be removed!".[59]Ttrescu resigned his office on 6 November 1947, and was replaced by the Communist Ana Pauker. For the following two months, he was sidelined in his own party by PCR pressures,[60] and removed from its leadership in January 1948 (being replaced with Petre N. Bejan  the party was subsequently known as National Liberal Party-Petre N. Bejan).[61] One of his last actions as cabinet member had been to sign the document officially rejecting the Marshall Plan.[62]After the proclamation of the People's Republic of Romania on 30 December 1947, the existence of all parties other than the PCR had become purely formal, and, after the elections of 28 March the single-party state was confirmed by legislation.[63] He was arrested on 5 May 1950, and held in the notorious Sighet prison[64] (alongside three of his brothers  tefan Ttrescu included  and his former collaborator Bejan).[65] His son Tudor, who was living in Paris, suffered from schizophrenia after 1950, and had to be committed to an institution (where he died in 1955).[2] Sandra Ttrescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950, and released three years later, upon the death of Joseph Stalin.[2]One of Gheorghe Ttrescu's last appearances in public was his stand as one of the prosecution's witnesses in the 1954 trial of Lucreiu Ptrcanu, when he claimed that the defendant had been infiltrated into the PCR during the time when he had been premier (Ptrcanu was posthumously cleared of all charges).[66] Released in 1955, Ttrescu died in Bucharest, less than two years later.[67] According to Sanda Ttrescu Negropontes, this came as a result of tuberculosis contracted while in detention.[2]1 Early life and politics2 First cabinet

iTunes is a media player and media library application developed by Apple Inc. It is used to play, download, save, and organize digital audio and video on personal computers running the OS X operating system and the iOS-based iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices. Editions of iTunes are also released for Microsoft Windows. It can connect to the iTunes Store to let users purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, iPod games, audiobooks, podcasts, movies and movie rentals in select countries, and ringtones, available on the iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth generation onward.) It is also used to download application software from the App Store for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. iTunes has been criticized for not being able to transfer music from one portable device to another.iTunes was introduced on January 9, 2001.[3] In June 2010, Apple released a new privacy policy relating to the establishment and collection of users' real-time location information.[4] The information had been included in various device-specific EULAs since 2008, but was not included in Apple's general privacy policy until 2010.[5]Alongside the launch of the iPhone 5, iPod Nano, and iPod Touch, Apple announced iTunes 11. Including a revamped user interface, tighter iCloud integration, and new features, iTunes 11 was billed for release in October 2012.[6] However, the launch was pushed back to November 29, with Apple citing extra development time as the cause for this delay. iTunes 11 is available as an update for Mac OS X, and via a download for Microsoft's Windows operating system.SoundJam MP, developed by Bill Kincaid and released by Casady & Greene in 1999,[7] was renamed iTunes when Apple purchased it in 2000. Jeff Robbin, Kincaid, and Dave Heller moved to Apple as part of the acquisition, where they continue to work today as the software's original developers. They simplified SoundJam's user interface, added the ability to burn CDs, and removed its recording feature and skin support.[8] On January 9, 2001, iTunes 1.0 was released at Macworld San Francisco. Macintosh users immediately began poking through iTunes' resource fork, where they discovered numerous strings and other resources that indicated iTunes was a re-engineered SoundJam MP. Casady & Greene ceased distribution of SoundJam MP on June 1, 2001 at the request of the developers.[9]Originally a Mac OS 9-only application, iTunes began to support Mac OS X when version 2.0 was released nine months later, which also added support for the original iPod.[10] version 3 dropped Mac OS 9 support but added smart playlists and a ratings system.[11] In April 2003, version 4.0 introduced the iTunes Store; in October, version 4.1 added support for Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows XP.[12] Introduced at Macworld 2005 with the new iPod Shuffle, Version 4.7.1 introduced the ability to automatically convert higher-bitrate songs to 128kbit/s AAC as these devices did not natively support audio encoded in AIFF or Apple Lossless formats, also improving the value proposition of the Shuffle's limited flash-only storage.[13] Version 7.0 introduced gapless playback and Cover Flow in September 2006.[14] In March 2007, iTunes 7.1 added support for Windows Vista,[15] and 7.3.2 was the last Windows 2000 version.[16] iTunes lacked support for 64-bit versions of Windows until the 7.6 update on January 16, 2008. iTunes is currently supported under any 64-bit version of Windows Vista, although the iTunes executable is still 32-bit. The 64-bit versions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are not supported by Apple, but a workaround has been devised for both operating systems.[17] Version 8.0 added Genius playlists, grid view, and a new default visualizer.[18] iTunes 9 added "Home Share", enabling automatic updating of purchased items across other computers on the same subnet and offers a new iTunes Store UI. Genius Mixes were added, as well as improved app synchronization abilities, extending the iPod Shuffle 128 kbit/s down-convert feature to all of Apple's AAC-capable devices.[19] It also adds iTunes LPs to the store, which provides additional media with an album. Apple added iTunes Extras as well to the store, which adds content usually reserved for films on DVD and Blu-ray discs.[20] Both iTunes LPs and Extras use web-standards HTML, JavaScript and CSS.[21]A version of iTunes[22] was shipped with cell phones from Motorola, which included the ability to sync music from an iTunes library to the cellphone, as well as a similar interface between both platforms. Since the release of the iPhone, Apple has stopped distributing iTunes with other manufacturers' phones. In the absence of support from Apple, Nokia has released a Mac application called Nokia Multimedia Transfer that supports transferring data from iTunes and iPhoto onto some Nokia devices.[23] Palm, however, reverse-engineered iTunes to allow its Pre device to sync directly with iTunes. It did this by fooling iTunes into thinking the device was an iPod.[24]In late March 2010, Apple released version 9.1, which has support for the iPad and its iBooks application.[25] iTunes 11 was released on November 29, 2012.In late June 2010, Apple released version 9.2, which brought support for the new iPhone 4, as well as any iDevices running iOS 4, and included support for the new iPhone and iPod Touch version of the iBooks app.[26]On September 1, 2010, Apple held their annual music press event, where they unveiled an updated version: iTunes 10. The new version was available for download later that day. One major feature includes the integration of iTunes Ping, which brings a social factor to the iTunes experience. Apple CEO Steve Jobs also announced a new logo, one without a CD in the background because of the increasing popularity of iTunes digital downloads.[citation needed]On November 29, 2012, Apple released iTunes 11. The update included a new user interface that dropped Cover Flow in favor of a redesigned grid layout. Other new features included an improved MiniPlayer, tighter iCloud integration, and a new iTunes Store design. iTunes Ping was dropped in favor of more advanced Twitter and Facebook integration.iTunes acts as a front end for Apple's QuickTime media player. Officially, it is required in order to manage the audio data of an iPod, iPhone, or iPad, although alternative software does exist. Users can organize their music into playlists within one or more libraries, edit file information, record Compact Discs, copy files to a digital audio player, purchase music and videos through its built-in music store (iTunes Store), download free podcasts, back up songs onto a CD or DVD, run a visualizer to display graphical effects in time to the music, and encode music into a number of different audio formats. There is also a large selection of free internet radio stations to listen to. Additionally, users can add PDF files to their library (to add digital liner notes to their albums, for example). The PDFs can be synchronized with and read on an iPod Touch, iPhone, or iPad, but not a regular iPod.[27]In iTunes 8.0 saw the removal of several options in the Preferences window. For example, iTunes once gave users the option to display arrows beside the selected song's title, artist, album, and genre that link directly to the iTunes Store. These arrows are no longer removable, except through the direct editing of a preferences file.[28]iTunes keeps track of songs by creating a virtual library, allowing users to access and edit a song's attributes. These attributes, known as metadata, are stored in two separate library files. The first is a binary file called iTunes Library and it uses a proprietary file format ("ITL"). It caches information like artist and genre from the audio format's tag capabilities (the ID3 tag, for example) and stores iTunes-specific information like play count and rating. iTunes typically reads library data only from this file.[29] The second file, iTunes Music Library.xml, is refreshed whenever information in iTunes is changed. It uses an XML format, allowing developers to easily write applications that can access the library information (including play count, last played date, and rating, which are not standard fields in the ID3v2.3 format). Apple's own iDVD, iMovie, and iPhoto applications all access the library.[30] If the first file exists but is corrupted, such as by making it zero-length, iTunes will attempt to reconstruct it from the XML file. Detailed third-party instructions regarding this are documented elsewhere.[31] Beginning with iTunes 10.5.3 this behavior has been changed such that the XML file is not read automatically to recreate the database when the database is corrupted. Rather, the user should load the iTunes Library.xml file via File > Library > Import Playlist....It has also been noted that iTunes does not automatically track changes to actual files in the library. If a file is moved or deleted, iTunes will display an exclamation mark beside the library entry and the user will need to manually amend the library record. Several third party tools address this problem.[32]iTunes supports ripping from CDs, but not from DVDs. However, in 2008, Apple and select film studios introduced "iTunes Digital Copy", a bonus feature on some DVDs that provides a copy-protected and iTunes-compatible file for select films.[33]iTunes 11 can currently read, write and convert between MP3, AIFF, WAV, MPEG-4, AAC and Apple Lossless (.m4a).[34]iTunes can also play any audio files that QuickTime can play (as well as some video formats), including Protected AAC files from the iTunes Store and Audible.com audio books. There is limited support for Vorbis and FLAC enclosed in an Ogg container (files using the Ogg container format are not natively supported) or Speex codecs with the Xiph QuickTime Components. Because tag editing and album art is done within iTunes and not QuickTime, these features will not work with these QuickTime components. As of Snow Leopard, iTunes 9 (Mac) will play HE-AAC / AAC+ internet streams. The latest version of iTunes (Win/Mac) supports importing audio CDs with the default iTunes standard file format of AAC at 256kbit/s, but users can choose from 16kbit/s to 320kbit/s constant bit rates (CBR) in either AAC or MP3.[citation needed] Importing of audio CDs into MP3 or AAC formats can also be accomplished using variable bitrate (VBR) encoding.The Windows version of iTunes can automatically transcode DRM-free WMA (including version 9) files to other audio formats, but does not support playback of WMA files and will not transcode DRM protected WMA files. Telestream, Inc. provides free codecs for Mac users of QuickTime to enable playback of unprotected Windows Media files. These codecs are recommended by Microsoft.[35]In addition to importing CDs into the iTunes library, the user can also import non-Apple mp3 files from Amazon.com and other sources. This can be accomplished by either right clicking on the file, selecting open with, and then selecting iTunes or dragging the file into the open iTunes window. Alternatively, for Amazon.com mp3s, the Amazon MP3 Downloader application will automatically import the mp3 files into the iTunes library.[36]For MP3 files, iTunes writes tags in ID3v2.2 using UCS-2 encoding by default, but converting them to ID3v2.3 (UCS-2 encoding) and ID3v2.4 (which uses UTF-8 encoding) is possible via its "Advanced" > "Convert ID3 Tags" toolbar menu. If both ID3v2.x and ID3v1.x tags are in a file, iTunes ignores the ID3v1.x tags.[37]Advanced Audio Coding and Apple Lossless files support Unicode metadata, stored in the MPEG-4 Part 14 container as so-called "atoms". The QuickTime plugin that supports the OGG container format has no support for tag editing or album art.[37][citation needed] iTunes uses the Gracenote interactive audio CD database to provide track name listings for audio CDs. The service can be set to activate when a CD is inserted into the computer and an Internet connection is available. Track names for albums imported to iTunes while not connected to the Internet can be obtained during a later connection, by a manual procedure.[38] For any album loaded into iTunes for which there is not an existing Gracenote track listing, the user can choose to submit track name data to Gracenote.[39]File metadata is displayed in columns, including album, artist, beats per minute, bit rate, composer, date added, date modified, disc number, genre, last played, last skipped, plays, purchase date, size, skips, time, track number, year, and a few fields that may be supplied by users, such as description, kind, and rating. Metadata fields not loaded with the song, or added by a user, remain blank.The Genius feature, introduced in iTunes 8, automatically generates a playlist of songs from the user's library which are similar to the selected song. Genius playlists are created by the ratings system and collaborative filtering. An iTunes Store account is required because information about the user's library must first be sent anonymously to Apple's database. Algorithms determine which songs to play based on other users' libraries, and Genius becomes more intelligent given a larger data set. The resulting Genius playlist can contain 25, 50, 75, or 100 songs and can be refreshed for new results or saved. The iTunes Sidebar recommends selections for purchase from the iTunes Store based on the selected library track.[40] Once Genius becomes active in iTunes, it can be used on current generations of the iPod Classic, iPod Nano, iPod Touch or the iPhone.[41] iTunes 9 added Genius Mixes, where the Genius software finds similar music and automatically puts them into mixes.[42] iTunes Genius creates playlists from the user's existing iTunes library based on a single selected song. Genius Mixes create playlists based on the musical genre.One way of sharing a library is over the network, known as network sharing. A user's iTunes Library can be shared over a local network using the closed, proprietary Digital Audio Access Protocol (DAAP), created by Apple for this purpose. DAAP relies on the Bonjour network service discovery framework, Apple's implementation of the Zeroconf open network standard. Apple has not made the DAAP specification available to the general public, only to third-party licensees such as Roku. However, the protocol has been reverse-engineered and is now used to stream audio from non-Apple software (mainly on the Linux platform).[43] DAAP allows shared lists of songs within the same subnet to be automatically detected. When a song is shared, iTunes can stream the song but won't save it on the local hard drive, in order to prevent unauthorized copying. Songs in Protected AAC format can also be accessed, but authentication is required. A maximum of five users may connect to a single user every 24 hours. The multiple, alternate "View" options normally available to iTunes users including "Cover Flow" are disabled when viewing a shared library over a network.[citation needed]Library sharing was first introduced with iTunes 4.0, where users could freely access shared music anywhere over the Internet, in addition to one's own subnet, by specifying IP addresses of remote shared song libraries. Apple quickly removed this feature with version 4.0.1, claiming that users were violating the End User License Agreement.[44]With the release of iTunes 7.0, Apple changed their implementation of DAAP. This change prevents any third-party client, such as a computer running Linux, a modified Xbox, or any computer without iTunes installed, from connecting to a remote iTunes repository. iTunes will still connect as a client to other iTunes servers and to third-party servers.[45]iTunes libraries can also be shared using the Home Share option. This option enables users to share both video and audio files through the application. This allows users to also look for items that they dont already have.[46] Like network sharing, it allows users to share over the same network to up to five computers. The media can then be transferred to any type of iPod or iPad. To set up home sharing, the two computers being used must be on the same network as well as set up using the same Apple ID.Another option to share music files is to burn CDs. To do this the user needs to create a playlist with the songs the user wishes to share. If the playlist exceeds roughly twenty songs it is likely they will need to make multiple CDs. By inserting a disk into the disk drive a button on the bottom of the window should give the option to burn a disk. The files are automatically downloaded to the disk and may be uploaded onto another computer or saved as a backup for the users computer.iTunes allows users to choose different ways to categorise their collection, and displays content according to the selection. The default settings show the music collection sorted by album, laying out the artwork in a grid similar to the iPad music application. When selected, albums extend downwards, showing their contents, and allowing users to browse the store for missing or related content. The content listings are themed depending on the predominant color of the album artwork. Film and television shows are laid out in the same manner, with their posters or artwork laid out in a grid. Users may alternately arrange their music collection as a list of every song, by genre, or by artist. These show details in a list structure, but the latter two include the album artwork as thumbnails to aid navigation. Items are automatically arranged alphabetically by album name, but users may rearrange this if using the song list option.iTunes 11 removes the Cover Flow option, previously the default viewing method for a user's music collection. It also disables the sidebar, focussing on spreading content across the width of the window. The status bar is also disabled by default. Both of these may be reactivated by the user. The sidebar design has been slightly altered, reinstating the colored icons removed in iTunes 10. When the sidebar is not activated, users can move between media libraries using a drop down menu below the control buttons.In addition to static playlist support, version 3 of iTunes introduced support for smart playlists.[47] Smart playlists are playlists that can be set to automatically filter the library based on a customized list of selection criteria, much like a database query. Multiple criteria can be entered to manage the smart playlist.[48]Some automatic smart playlists that are added to the users library include Top 25 Most Played, Recently Played, Recently Added, My Top Rated, Music Videos, Classical Music, Purchased, and 90s Music. While creating Smart Playlists the user has to choose whether they want the playlist to be based on genre, whether or not the songs have album artwork, date added, etc. and if they want it to contain or not contain certain genres or artists. For example, a genre like country music, or songs added in a specific month or year, or an individual artist. The user can also limit the amount of songs they want in the playlist or they can leave it as unlimited. The Live Updating option will automatically update their new playlist as their library changes.[49]Any user of iTunes can publish a playlist to the iTunes Store with his or her own preferences, which is called an iMix.Introduced in iTunes 4.5,[50] the "Party Shuffle" playlist was intended as a simple DJing aid.[51] By default, it selects tracks randomly from other playlists or the library, but users can override the automatic selections by deleting tracks (iTunes will choose new ones to replace them) or by adding their own via drag-and-drop or contextual menu. This allows a mixture of both preselected and random tracks in the same meta-playlist. The playlist from which Party Shuffle drew could be changed on the fly by the computer user, but doing so will cause all randomly chosen tracks to disappear and be replaced.Party Shuffle was renamed iTunes DJ in iTunes 8. When iTunes was updated to 8.1, quite a few features were added to iTunes DJ. The free Apple Remote application for the iPhone and iPod Touch was also updated at this time that added a new iTunes DJ option in the settings screen when the user is connected to a Wi-Fi network and a new song request feature is enabled in iTunes DJ on the hosts. Along with the song request feature voting on songs in the queue was added, the more votes a song gets the higher in the queue it will be and the sooner it will be played. Song voting can only be done when song requesting is enabled and in two ways: the first by right clicking on a song in the iTunes DJ queue on the host's computer in iTunes, the second is in the Remote application ether connected with the iTunes DJ option by a guest or by the host in the full playlist section. When song requesting is enabled a customizable welcome message is displayed below the host's shared library name in the button used to connect to iTunes DJ.[52]Playlists can be played randomly or sequentially. The randomness of the shuffle algorithm can be biased for or against playing multiple tracks from the same album or artists in sequence (a feature introduced in iTunes 5.0, and later discontinued in iTunes 8.0). iTunes DJ can also be biased towards selecting tracks with a higher star rating.With the release of iTunes 11, the iTunes DJ feature was removed in favor of the Up Next feature, which allows users to specify a song from their collection to play next, add it to a queue of songs to be played, or view a list of previously played tracks. However, the Up Next feature does not include features previously found in iTunes DJ, such as the ability to for guests to request songs.The App section on iTunes keeps track of all of the apps the user has downloaded or purchased. It also organizes their apps by genre and there is another tab that lets the user see all of their apps. It also informs the user when they have updates available for their apps.iTunes includes sound processing features, such as equalization, "sound enhancement" and crossfade. There is also a feature called "Sound Check", which automatically adjusts the playback volume of all songs in the library to the same level; this is usually called volume leveling or audio normalization. Like "sound enhancement" and crossfade, this can be turned on in the Playback section of iTunes' preferences.In October 2005, the iTunes Store began to offer the option of downloading television shows.[53] iTunes offers the option of buying individual episodes of TV shows for $1.99 in standard definition or $2.99 in high definition. The high definition feature on TV shows was added in July 2008.[54] iTunes also offers the ability to buy a season pass for television shows. This allows viewers to buy an entire season that automatically downloads new episodes around twenty-four hours after they air. In the iTunes library, these shows are then categorized by season of the particular show. iTunes also gives the option of ordering shows based on: series, genre, or whether or not the episodes are unwatched. In fall of 2010 iTunes offered TV show rental options, but as of August 2011 this option is no longer offered.[55]In September 2006, iTunes progressed to selling full-length films.[54] This entails downloading movies from the iTunes store. The prices for these range from: $9.99, $14.99 if it is a new release, and $19.99 if it is in High Definition.[56] iTunes also gives the option of renting movies, which began in January 2008.[54] The price for renting a movie can range from $0.99 if the movie is on sale, $3.99, and $4.99 if the rental is HD. However, iTunes sometimes carries, for a limited time, movies to rent that are available OnDemand, for a price of $6.99 in both SD and HD. Once a rental is downloaded the viewer has thirty days to watch the movie before it expires. Once the viewer begins to watch the movie he/she has twenty-four hours to finish the movie before it expires. Movies can be organized in the iTunes library by title, genre, or unwatched.On May 9, 2005, video support was introduced to iTunes with the release of iTunes 4.8. Users can drag and drop video clips from the computer into the iTunes Library for cataloguing and organization. They can be viewed in a small frame in the main iTunes display, in a separate window, or fullscreen. Before version 7 provided separate libraries for media types, videos were only distinguished from audio in the Library by a small icon resembling a TV screen and grouped with music in the library, organized by the same musical categories (such as "album" and "composer").On October 12, 2005, Apple introduced iTunes 6.0, which added support for purchasing and viewing of video content from the iTunes Music Store. The iTunes Music Store initially offered a selection of thousands of Music Videos and five TV shows, including most notably the ABC network's Lost and Desperate Housewives. Disney Channel shows (The Suite Life of Zack & Cody and That's So Raven) were also offered 24 hours after airing, as well as episode packs from past seasons. Since then, the collection has expanded to include content from numerous television networks. The iTunes Music Store also gives the ability to view Apple's large collection of film trailers.As of September 5, 2006, the iTunes Store offers over 550 television shows for download. Additionally, a catalog of 75 feature-length films from Disney-owned studios was introduced. As of April 11, 2007, over 500 feature-length films are available through iTunes.[57]Originally, films and TV shows were only available to U.S. customers, with the only video content available to non-U.S. customers being music videos and Pixar's short films. This feature is being extended to other countries as licensing issues are resolved.Video content available from the store used to be encoded as 540kbit/s Protected MPEG-4 video (H.264) with an approximately 128kbit/s AAC audio track. Many videos and video podcasts currently require the latest version of QuickTime, QuickTime 7, which is incompatible with older versions of Mac OS (only v10.3.9 and later are supported). On September 12, 2006, the resolution of video content sold on the iTunes Store was increased from 320240 (QVGA) to 640480 (VGA). The higher resolution video content is encoded as 1.5 Mbit/s (minimum) Protected MPEG-4 video (H.264) with a minimum 128kbit/s AAC audio track.In February 2010, Apple announced the release of the iPad, and along with it a new app for it called iBooks. The application performs two functions. The first function is as a direct link to the iTunes book store, called iBookstore, which can be accessed on iOS devices and computers (Mac or PC). The second was as a storage place for downloaded books (whether free or purchased) from the iBookstore. The format of books from the Apple store (and the only one users could use with iBooks, until PDF functionality was added later) is ePub.Additional functions were later added in mid-2010 to include annotations and placeholder/bookmarks in any book being read. Also PDF documents were able to be added, and were stored under their own tab in a user's iBooks library, with the same functionality. The iBooks app for the other two iOS devices (iPhone and iPod Touch) was released when iOS 4 was distributed shortly before the release of the iPhone 4.One current limitation of books (though not PDF documents) is that they can only be read using the app on any iOS device and cannot be read inside iTunes on a user's Mac or PC. PDF documents can be read using Preview or any other PDF reader/editor application the user has on their machine.On January 19, 2012, Apple announced a new part of the Books store with textbooks. They also released a new authoring method called iBooks Author.While iTunes 10 supported iCloud, it did not integrate offline and cloud libraries. A list of previously purchased content was accessible via the iTunes store, where users could download content to the device they were using. Automatic downloading of newly purchased content could also be enabled, and iTunes Match allowed content purchased outside of the iTunes store to be uploaded to iCloud. With the release of iTunes 11, iCloud became fully integrated into iTunes. Content stored in a user's iCloud is displayed in the same way as that stored on their device, and online content does not have to be downloaded to be played. Films and TV shows also resume from where they were left off on the last device to have played them.Version 4 of iTunes introduced the iTunes Store, then named the iTunes Music Store, from which iTunes users can buy and download songs for use on a limited number of computers and an unlimited number of iPods. In previous years, purchased music from the iTunes Store were copy protected with Apple's FairPlay digital rights management (DRM) system which allows protected songs to be played on up to five computers at one time, as well as unlimited devices (iPod, AppleTV, etc.) DRM protected songs cannot be played on computers not authorized to the purchaser's iTunes account. At the 2009 Macworld Conference & Expo, it was announced that the iTunes Music Store would be DRM-free, with all songs digital rights management (DRM)-free by April 2009.[58]Apple also announced changes in their price tier. They announced that songs will now cost $0.69, $0.99, or $1.29, but did not elaborate on how they will be priced. Observers expected new hits to be $1.29 while older songs will be the cheaper $0.99 or $0.69 tier.[59] However, many record labels have listed whole catalogs by artists with nothing but $1.29 songs, taking advantage of the price option. Due to this, there are very few songs in the iTunes store with a $0.69 price tag.[60]In the years since, films, television programs, music videos, podcasts, and the App Store (for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad) have been added to iTunes' extensive store catalog.On January 6, 2009, Phil Schiller announced in his Macworld 2009 keynote speech that over 6 billion songs had been downloaded since the service first launched on April 28, 2003,[61] making it the largest online music store in the world.At the previous Macworld Expo 2008, Apple CEO Steve Jobs stated that the service had set a new single day record of 20 million songs on December 25, 2007. He also announced that the iTunes Store will offer over 1,000 movies for rental by the end of February.[62] The iTunes movie catalog includes content from 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., Walt Disney Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, and Sony Pictures Entertainment. These movies will also be transferable to all 6th generation iPods.[63]On February 24, 2010, Apple announced that over 10 billion tracks had been downloaded from the iTunes Store.[64]As of Tuesday, November 16, 2010, Beatles fans could download their entire catalog digitally via iTunes.[65] Artists whose music remains largely unavailable include Garth Brooks, Kid Rock, Tool, and Bob Seger. Def Leppard albums are no longer available through iTunes.[66]On May 30, 2007, Apple announced the launch of "iTunes U" via its digital content store, iTunes, which delivers university lectures through a format called iTunesU.[67][68] The service was created to manage, distribute, and control access to educational audio and video content for students in a college or university. Member institutions have the opportunity to have their own iTunes U site, which facilitates searching for material. The online service is free for uploading or downloading these documents. iTunes U includes lectures, language lessons, lab demonstrations, sports, and campus tours provided by many colleges and universities in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand.Right around the end of 2009/start of 2010, new members' institutions no longer have the capability to upload content to Apple's servers. Any member institutions before that are grandfathered in.[citation needed]iTunes U has collected materials from a variety of locations around the world, including colleges, universities, museums, libraries and other cultural institutions of educational value. There are currently more than 75,000 files available for download. The Open University in the UK set the record for the most downloads as of October 3, 2011 having reached 40 million downloads.[69]In late August 2010, iTunes U surpassed 300 million downloads from more than 800 institutions.[citation needed]Version 4.9 of iTunes, released on June 28, 2005, added built-in support for podcasts.[70]Users can subscribe to any podcast by entering its RSS feed URL, but also by browsing the podcast directory within iTunes Music Store. The front page of this displays high-profile podcasts from commercial broadcasters and independent podcasters and allows searching by category or popularity. Once subscribed, the podcast can be set to download manually, or automatically and as with other audio, content can be listened to directly or synced to a portable hardware device like an MP3 player.The addition of podcasting functionality to such a widespread audio application like iTunes greatly helped podcasting enter the mainstream.[71] Within days after iTunes 4.9 was released, podcasters were reporting that the number of downloads of their audio files had tripled, sometimes even quadrupled,[72] and iTunes is considered the dominant podcast client.iTunes offers the ability to create "Smart Playlists" that can be used to control which podcasts are in the playlist, using multiple criteria such as date, number of times listened to, type, etc.[73] It is also possible to set up iTunes so that only certain playlists will be synced with the iPod. By using a combination of the two techniques, it is possible to control exactly which music and/or podcasts will be transferred to the iPod. A user may configure a smart playlist to display only podcasts less than two weeks old or removing any podcast that the iPod user has already listened to. This smart playlist is synced with the iPod every time the iPod is plugged into the PC, ensuring that the user does not have to listen to the same show more than once. Once a podcast has been listened to, it will be removed from this list as soon as the iPod is synced with the PC. There are many criteria which can control what goes in a smart playlist, such as "name", "artist", "category", "grouping", "kind", "last played", "play count", "rating", "last skipped", and "playlist" and these can be combined with functions such as "equals", "is greater than", "is less than", "contains", "does not contain", "is true", "is false", "is", "is not", "starts with", "ends with", "is in the range", "is before", and "is after". As a result, it is possible to control exactly which podcasts are transferred to the iPod.Version 6 of iTunes introduced official support for video podcasting, although video and RSS support was already unofficially there in version 4.9.[74]Users can subscribe to RSS feeds through the iTunes Store or by directly entering the feed URL. Video podcasts can contain downloadable video files (in MOV, MP4, M4V, or MPG format), but also streaming sources and even IPTV.[75]Downloadable files can be synchronized to a video-capable iPod, or downloadable files and streams can be shown in Front Row.[74]iTunes 2 was the first version of the software to be able to sync with an iPod. iTunes can automatically synchronize its music and video library with an iPod or iPhone every time it is connected. New songs and playlists are automatically copied to the iPod, and songs and playlists that have been deleted from the library on the host computer are also deleted from the iPod. Ratings awarded to songs on the iPod will sync back to the iTunes library and audiobooks will also remember the current playback position.Automatic synchronization can be turned off in favor of manually copying individual songs or complete playlists. iTunes supports copying music to an iPod; however, only music and videos purchased from the iTunes Store can be transferred from the iPod back to iTunes. This functionality was added after third-party software was written which allowed users to copy all content back to their computer. It is also possible to copy from the iPod using ordinary Unix command line tools, or by enabling hidden file viewing in Windows Explorer, then copying music from the iPod drive to a local disk for backup. Doing this can be confusing because the files are arranged in such a way that their folders and (depending on iPod and iTunes versions) file names are seemingly picked at random as they are put on the iPod. It is worth noting, however, that the files (along with their embedded title and artist information) remain unchanged. It is therefore less confusing to let iTunes reimport, reorganize, and rename all of the files after they are backed up. When music or video purchased through the iTunes Store is copied from an iPod, it will only play on computers that are authorized with the account that was used to purchase them. Several third party utilities can remove this limitation by stripping iTunes DRM from protected files. The legality of using such software in the United States is currently the subject of active debate.[76]When an iPod is connected that does not contain enough free space to sync the entire iTunes music library, a playlist will be created and given a name matching that of the connected iPod. This playlist can then be modified to the user's preference in song selection to fill the available space.The Mac OS X version of iTunes can also synchronize with a small number of discontinued digital music players,[77] while the Windows version supports only the iPod.[78] The synchronization is limited, however, in that the iPod is the only digital music player compatible with Apple's proprietary FairPlay digital rights management technology, and thus most music purchased through the iTunes Store (before the introduction of iTunes Plus) can only be played on an iPod. The remaining ability to synchronize with a limited number of legacy digital music players is likely a remnant of Apple's history in the music industry: iTunes was released in January 2001, nine months prior to the iPod's unveiling, and slightly more than two years before the introduction of the iTunes Music Store. When iTunes was released, compatibility with other music players was critical. Since iPod has now become the dominant digital music player, Apple no longer considers that compatibility to be a necessity.In June 2009, Palm Inc released the Palm Pre, which has the ability to sync with both the Windows and Mac OS X version of iTunes by identifying itself to iTunes as an iPod. The Pre is able to sync only DRM-free music.[79] However, on July 14, 2009, Apple released iTunes version 8.2.1, which prevented the Palm Pre from syncing directly with iTunes. Then on July 23, 2009, Palm Inc released WebOS 1.1, re-enabling syncing between iTunes 8.2.1 and the Palm Pre.[80] But Apple again prevented Palm Pre syncing with the release of iTunes 9.[81]A number of unsupported third-party applications have been created to assist synchronization of songs with any music player that can be mounted as an external drive. Though iTunes is the only official method for synchronizing with the iPod, there are other applications available that allow the iPod to sync with other software players.As of iTunes 7, purchased music can be copied from the iPod onto the computer. The computer must be authorized by that iTunes account. iTunes currently allows up to 5 computers to be authorized on one account. To de-authorize and register new computers thereafter, all accounts must be deleted, followed by registering the live one. This can be done only once a year.iTunes does not feature any transfer facility for importing music files between computers directly. This is being addressed in September 2011 by iCloud, but only tracks that Apple sell in their iTunes Store are available (in 256 kbit/s AAC format) without uploading them to iCloud first. Any other tracks, that are either not available in the Store or that the user wants in different encoding can be uploaded to the iCloud with 5 GB of free space and the, as yet undisclosed, potential to purchase more storage. Though what audio formats will be accepted for upload has not been confirmed.iTunes managed content can also be accessed via the Apple TV set-top box. Files in the iTunes library can either be synchronized with the Apple TV unit, which results in their being copied to the Apple TV's hard drive (for the first generation Apple TV), or streamed to the Apple TV directly from a Macintosh or PC. Apple TV does not require the use of iTunes (as of the 'Take Two' software update) and can now import files from the iTunes Store directly over the internet.[82]As of iTunes 9.1, it is possible to sync the iPad to iTunes, allowing music, movies, applications and iBooks to be synced to the iPad. As of 10.5, iTunes supports syncing the iPhone using both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.[83]Beginning with the introduction of the original iPhone, iTunes can activate their phone through their mobile carrier. The original plan for the iPhone 3G was to have the carrier authenticate it at the point of sale, either through iTunes or through the carrier's own activation interface.[84] However, a worldwide crash of iTunes' authentication servers on July 11, 2008, the day that the iPhone 3G was released, caused major issues. In some cases, AT&T and Apple Store employees told iPhone buyers to attempt to activate it at home.[85] Also affected were original iPhone users attempting to upgrade to the 2.0 firmware.[86][87] UK Apple, O2 and Carphone Warehouse stores were further impacted, as carrier O2's contract processing servers (known as Gateway) could not handle the amount of new contracts and upgrades happening on launch day. Some stores reverted to hand written contracts, while others held stock. With the launch of the iPhone 3GS on June 19, 2009, iTunes at home activation was available for people purchasing their iPhone from AT&T Mobility and Apple. This allowed them to activate their new iPhone 3G/iPhone 3GS at home when they arrived.[88]In Mac OS X, iTunes is tightly integrated with Apple's iWork and iLife suites. These applications can access the iTunes Library directly, allowing access to the playlists and songs stored within (including encrypted music purchased from the iTunes Store). Music files from iTunes can be embedded directly into Pages documents and can supply the score for iDVD, iMovie, and Keynote productions. iTunes is also integrated with Front Row, compiling its information from the user's iTunes and iPhoto libraries. In addition, any song exported from GarageBand, Apple's basic music-making application, is automatically added to the user's iTunes music library. iTunes's Artwork.saver is a screen saver included in Mac OS X v10.4 that displays album artwork as a screen saver. iTunes widget is a Dashboard Widget that controls iTunes.In Windows, Adobe Photoshop Elements can connect to iTunes in order to stream its photo library on Apple TV.Moreover, iTunes can be scripted, using AppleScript for Mac OS X or using the Apple-provided SDK for iTunes on Windows allowing many other applications to integrate themselves into iTunes. A common use is to relay the title and artist of what the user is currently listening to into their instant messenger, or social networking service. LimeWire, which closed on October 26, 2010, was a peer-to-peer program that provided integration with iTunes, adding songs from LimeWire directly to your iTunes library without sharing your iTunes purchased songs.In addition, visualizer plugins and device plugins are supported. Visualizer plugins allow developers to create music-driven visual displays and free software development kits are available for Mac and Windows can be from Apple.[89]Device plugins allow support for additional music player devices, but the APIs is only licensed to authentic OEMs who sign a non-disclosure agreement.Apple Inc. also offers a free iOS application that allows the user to remotely control their iTunes library or Apple TV over DACP.[90] This can be downloaded from iTunes itself or directly from one's iOS device. It is only compatible with iOS v2.0 and above. In terms of usage, it is very similar to the iPod application that is included with all iPhones, with the only difference is the lack of Cover Flow support.Though iTunes itself can be installed where the user desires, ancillary applications such as Bonjour which are part of the iTunes installation cannot be placed in a user-desired directory.[91]To compensate for the lack of a physical CD, iTunes can print custom-made jewel case inserts as well as song lists and album lists. After burning a CD from a playlist, one can select that playlist and bring up a dialog box with several print options. The user can choose to print either a single album cover (for purchased iTunes albums) or a compilation cover (for user-created playlists). iTunes then automatically sets up a template with art on one side and track titles on the other.[citation needed]An iMix is a free user-created playlist published in the iTunes Store. iMixes were first introduced in iTunes version 4.5.[92] However, they are limited to 100 songs, must feature content available on the iTunes Store, and are active for one year from their original published date. iMixes are public and searchable by any iTunes user, and can be rated using a five-star system. Users can publish their iTunes iMix to their blog, profile page, or website.When iTunes was first released, it came with support for the Kerbango Internet radio tuner service, giving users a selection of some of the more popular online radio streams available.[93] When Kerbango went out of business in 2001, Apple created its own Internet radio service for use with iTunes 2.0 and later.[94] As of February 2008, the iTunes radio service features 1795 "radio stations", mostly in MP3 streaming format. Programming covers many genres of music and talk, including streams from both internet-only sources and traditional radio stations. iTunes also supports the .pls and .m3u stream file formats used by Winamp and other media players.Since the release of iTunes 7, Apple no longer promotes the Internet radio feature, though it remains in the application. Some third-parties offer iTunes plugins that add additional radio stations.In addition, users are able to enter additional stream feeds to listen to in their own music libraries. This is done by selecting the menu item "Advanced" > "Open Audio Stream..." or by the hotkey Ctrl-U (PC) or Command-U (Mac).[73]Apple revealed a new feature within iTunes 10 on September 1, 2010 called Ping,[95] which was intended to bring a social music networking component to users of iTunes. It was not made available to all countries.[96] Ping could be connected to user's Twitter accounts.[97] Ping connected user accounts of iTunes, allowing iTunes users to share and recommend music to one another.Ping also let users to follow artists to see the photos and videos they have posted, their tour dates, playlists they have created, and their comments on other artists albums. Users could create a profile so their friends could see whom they were following, what they were listening to, and what concerts they were going to. Ping also showed users' top 10 lists of songs and albums among the people they followed. It also provided artist recommendations to follow based on one's library and preference options.[98]Apple officially discontinued the service on September 30, 2012 and will replace it in iTunes with Facebook and Twitter integration.[99]In June 2010, Apple updated its general privacy policy for the iTunes Store and iOS 4 supported devices, revealing that it could and would collect real-time location-based information on users aged 13 and over.The revised policy states that Apple has the right to share this information with 3rd parties who provide services to the customer, including advertising and promotion services. Apple also states that "it may be necessary" to provide this [real-time] information in response to "requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence or if [Apple] determines that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.... Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party."The revised policy does not make any distinction between warrant-based and warrantless searches, nor provide what criteria would trigger the sharing of personal real-time information with government entities, nor allow an opt-out for the location-based information.The revised policy prompted the co-chairs of the Bi-Partisan Privacy Caucus of the United States House of Representatives to request that Apple respond to nine basic privacy questions out of concern of possible violation of that country's Federal Communications Act. The Caucus stated it was pleased with Apple's prompt written explanations, and stated they would continue to monitor the issue.[4][100]The Telegraph reported in November 2011 that Apple had been aware of a security flaw since 2008, that would let unauthorized third parties install "updates" to end-user's iTunes' software.[101] They reported that a security writer named Brian Krebs had informed Apple of the vulnerability in 2008. They reported that the flaw was only closed in November 2011. They reported that United Kingdom security software firm Gamma International developed a program named FinFisher, intended to covertly spy on computer uses, which can be clandestinely installed via bogus updates to iTunes' software. Der Spiegel reported Gamma International had advertised the capability to clandestinely install FinFisher by exploiting this iTunes vulnerability.[102]1 History2 Features

The Cannon Group Inc. was an American group of companies, including Cannon Films, which produced a distinctive line of low-to-medium budget films[2] from 1967 to 1993. The extensive group also owned, amongst others, a large international cinema chain and a video film company that invested heavily in the video market, buying the international video rights to several classic film libraries.Cannon Films was incorporated on October 23, 1967. It was formed by Dennis Friedland and Chris Dewey while they were in their early 20s. By 1970, they had produced films on a larger production scale than a lot of major distributors, such as Joe, starring Peter Boyle. They managed this by tightly limiting their budgets to $300,000 per pictureor less, in some cases. However, as the 1970s moved on, a string of unsuccessful movies seriously drained Cannons capital. This, along with changes to film-production tax laws, led to a drop in Cannon's stock price. 1978 saw the German release of the science-fiction musical The Apple under the title Star Rock. Other notable films co-produced by Friedland and Dewey included Blood on Satan's Claw and Michael Reeves' The Sorcerers.By 1979, Cannon had hit serious financial difficulties, and Friedland and Dewey sold Cannon to Israeli cousins Menahem Golan (who had directed The Apple) and Yoram Globus for $500,000.[3] The two cousins forged a business model of buying bottom-barrel scripts and putting them into production.They tapped into a ravenous market for action B-pictures in the 1980s.[4] Although they are most remembered for the Death Wish sequels and Chuck Norris action pictures such as The Delta Force and Invasion U.S.A., and even the vigilante thriller Exterminator 2 (the sequel to 1980s The Exterminator), Cannons output was actually far more varied, with musical and comedy films like Breakin, Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo, The Last American Virgin, and the U.S. release of The Apple; period romance pictures like Lady Chatterley's Lover (1981), Bolero, and Mata Hari (1985); science fiction and fantasy films like Hercules, Lifeforce and The Barbarians; as well as serious pictures like John Cassavetes Love Streams, Zeffirellis Otello (a film version of the Verdi opera), Norman Mailers Tough Guys Dont Dance, Andrei Konchalovskys Runaway Train, and Shy People; and action/adventure films such as the 3-D Treasure of the Four Crowns, King Solomons Mines, Cobra and American Ninja.One of Cannons biggest hits was the Vietnam action B-movie Missing in Action, with Chuck Norris.[5] The film, however, was criticized heavily as being a preemptive cash-in on the Rambo film series.[6][7] James Cameron's story treatment for Rambo: First Blood Part II was floating around Hollywood in 1983, by which Golan and Globus reviewed and were "inspired".[6][7] The writers of MIA even gave Cameron credit saying their film was inspired by his script treatment.[8] But Cannon had initially put the prequel Missing in Action 2: The Beginning into production. Only after the two movies were completed had the company realized that the planned second movie was superior to the first one. So, the first movie produced became an awkward prequel.[9]During these years, Cannon worked with entertainment-advertising company Design Projects, Inc. for most of the one-sheet posters, trade advertising, and large billboards prominently displayed at the Cannes Film Festival each year. Substantial pre-sales of the next years' films were made based on the strong salesmanship skills of Golan, Danny Dimbort, and the advertising created by Design Projects. The deposits made from these sales financed production of the first film in the production line-up, whichwhen completed and delivered to theatre owners around the worldgenerated enough money to make the next film in the line-up. Slavenberg Bank in the Netherlands provided bridge financing until the pre-sales amounts were collected.By 1986, when company earnings reached their apex with 43 films in one year, Cannon Films shares had soared a hundredfold. Golan remained Chairman of the Board, while Globus served as President.During this year, Cannon Films released Robotech: The Movie (also called Robotech: The Untold Story) for a limited run in Mesquite, Texas. (A suburb of Dallas.) Cannon was reportedly unsatisfied with Carl Maceks first version of the movie, which was almost a straight adaptation of the anime Megazone 23. It was at their insistence that footage from The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross (the series adapted as the Robotech Masters segment of the Robotech TV series) and Megazone 23 be spliced together to produce a more action-oriented movie. Macek recalls that although he was unhappy with this revised version, Menahem Golan, after viewing it, happily said: "Now thats a Cannon movie!"[citation needed] Nevertheless, Robotech: The Movie was unsuccessful in its brief Texas run and saw no further release. Carl Macek has gone on record as disowning it.[citation needed]Film critic Roger Ebert said of Golan-Globus in 1987, "no other production organization in the world todaycertainly not any of the seven Hollywood "majors"has taken more chances with serious, marginal films than Cannon."[10] That year, Cannon gained its greatest artistic success: its Dutch production The Assault won the 1986 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film.Golan and Cannon Films were famous for making huge announcements and over-promoting movies that did not live up to expectationsor even exist. For instance, Lifeforce (1985) was to be "the cinematic sci-fi event of the '80s" and Masters of the Universe (1987) was dubbed "the Star Wars of the '80s."Additionally, Cannon owned the film rights to Spider-Man, and planned to make a Spider-Man movie in the mid-1980s.[11] Golan and Globus agreed to pay Marvel Comics $225,000 over the five-year option period, plus a percentage of the films revenues.[11] The rights would revert to Marvel if a film was not made by April 1990.[12]By 1988, a cooling of the film market and a string of box office flops had drained Cannons capital. The multi-million dollar production of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), whose original $36-million budget was halved ($17 million) by Cannon, failed at the box office. Cannon signed an agreement with Warner Bros. to handle part of Cannons assets; however, the financial loss was staggering. Having purchased Thorn EMI's Screen Entertainment division in 1986,[13] Cannon Films was severely stretched, and faced bankruptcy. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began an investigation into Cannon's financial reports, suspecting that Cannon had fraudulently misstated them.On the verge of failure, Cannon Films was taken over by Path Communications, a holding company controlled by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti. Financed by the French bank Credit Lyonnais, Path Communications' takeover of Cannon immediately began a corporate restructuring and refinancing of $250 million to pay off Cannon debt. By 1989, Golan, citing differences with both Parretti and Globus, resigned from his position and left Cannon to start 21st Century Film Corporation, while Globus remained with Path.One of the final movies produced by the team of Golan and Globus that received a wide release under the Cannon Films banner was the Jean-Claude Van Damme post-apocalyptic action film Cyborg. This film was conceived to use both the costumes and sets built for an intended sequel to Masters of the Universe and the ill-fated live-action version of Spider-Man. Both projects were planned to shoot simultaneously under the direction of Albert Pyun. After Cannon Films had to cancel deals with both Mattel and Marvel Entertainment because of their financial troubles, they needed to recoup the money spent on both projects.As part of his severance package from Path, Golan took the rights to Marvels characters Spider-Man and Captain America. (Golan was able to put Captain America into production, and released it directly to video through his 21st Century Film Corporation.) Not to let that pre-production work go to waste, Pyun wrote Cyborg, with Chuck Norris in mind, suggesting it to Cannon Films. Jean-Claude Van Damme was cast in the lead role. Some television stations still give the films title as Masters of the Universe 2: Cyborg.Following Golan's departure from Cannon Films, he became the head of 21st Century Film Corporation. Globus continued working with Parretti at Path.When Path took over control of MGM/UA in 1990 as part of the MGM-Pathe merger, the Cannon Films library became part of the MGM library. During Parretti's tenure at MGM, he appointed Globus as president of the studio for a brief period of time.In 1990, Parretti reorganized Cannon Pictures, Inc. as the low-budget distribution arm of Path. Veteran Italian film producer Ovidio G. Assonitis served as Chairman and CEO of the new Cannon Pictures from 1990 to 1991. After the MGM-Pathe merger, Cannon Pictures spun off from Path, and was later run by former Cannon Group production head Christopher Pearce, who served as Chairman and CEO from 1991 to 1994. Cannon Pictures continued to release films, including A Man Called Sarge, American Ninja 4: The Annihilation and No Place to Hide.Parretti was pushed out of management control of MGM in 1991 by Credit Lyonnais, after he defaulted on loan payments.[14] Parretti was later convicted of perjury and evidence tampering in a Delaware court for statements he made in a 1991 civil case, brought by Credit Lyonnais to validate their removal of Parretti, to the effect that a document he claimed allowed him to retain control of MGM was authentic;[15][16] he fled the country for Italy before he could be sentenced or extradited to France, where he was wanted on criminal charges related to his use of MGM's French assets.[16][17] In 1997, the California Superior Court in Los Angeles entered a final judgement in a separate civil suit against Parretti, ordering him to pay $1.48 billion to Credit Lyonnais.[16] After Federal prosecuters unsealed an indictment against Parretti and Florio Fiorini accusing them of fraud in 1999, Italian authorities arrested both men and held them for extradition to the United States.[18] Parretti was released by the cort of appeal in Perugia shortly thereafter, ordered to remain in his home town of Orvieto and report to the police three times a week, even though authorities in Rome had requested he be held pending a decision on the extradition.[19]The 1988 Golan-Globus film Alien from L.A., starring model Kathy Ireland, was used as the basis of episode #516 of the movie-mocking television show Mystery Science Theater 3000. In 1993, Cannon Pictures released its last film Street Knight before it closed down. Yoram Globus and Christopher Pearce later joined 21st Century Film Corporation until 1996.Golan is still producing and directing films. Globus is the president of Globus Max, which has interests in film production and distribution and runs a 140-screen cinema chain in Israel.[citation needed]In late 2011 it was revealed that Australian director Mark Hartley is working on a documentary about Cannon Films called Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films.[20]The Cannon Group's first films in the United States were distributed independently and released on home video, initially through MCA Videocassette, Inc. and later on the small Paragon Video label. Cannon then made a deal with MGM, and their movies were distributed for home video (and later some films theatrically) by MGM, appearing in the gray MGM Video "big boxes".Later, Golan and Globus had a falling out with MGM, supposedly over the erotic unrated film Bolero with Bo Derek, which ended up being released under the U.S.A. Home Video label. Their movies were then released on home video for a short time by Media Home Entertainment, with some of the larger films, like Masters of the Universe and Over the Top, distributed by either or Warner Bros. or TriStar Pictures. When Cannon merged with Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment, they inherited EMI's home video label, which was then a partnership with HBO; however, they soon withdrew from the partnership to start their own video label with underwriting from WB, which lasted into the 1990s.Today, the worldwide theatrical and home-video rights (as well as international TV rights) to the majority of Cannon's library are owned by MGM, with the following exceptions:In all cases except worldwide television rights to Lifeforce, Trifecta Entertainment & Media handles the United States television rights to the Cannon pictures produced by Golan and Globus from 1979 onward; these rights were previously owned by Viacom Enterprises, Paramount Domestic Television, CBS Paramount Domestic Television, and CBS Television Distribution. CTD and its ancestor companies owned the TV rights to Superman IV until 2006, after which Warner Bros. Television took over the rights for three years, which went in 2009 to Paramount through television licensee Trifecta. Paramount Pictures owns the rights to distribute the Cannon library (except Lifeforce) on digital platforms. MGM retains television and digital platform rights to earlier Cannon films released before the company's purchase by Golan and Globus in 1979, such as Joe.1 History

Eugene (/judin/) is a major city of the Pacific Northwest located in the state of Oregon. It is the second-largest city in the U.S. state of Oregon and the county seat of Lane County. It is located at the south end of the Willamette Valley, near the confluence of the McKenzie and Willamette rivers, about 50 miles (80km) east of the Oregon Coast.As of the 2010 U.S. Census, Eugene has a population of 156,185, and Lane County (co-located with the Eugene-Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area) (MSA) has a population of 351,715.[2][5] While Eugene has long been the second-largest city in Oregon, it was briefly surpassed by Salem between 2005 and 2007.[6][7][8] The Eugene-Springfield, Oregon MSA is the 144th largest metropolitan statistical area of the U.S., and the third-largest in the state, behind the Portland Metropolitan Area and the Salem Metropolitan Area.Eugene is home to the University of Oregon. The city is also noted for its natural beauty, recreational opportunities (especially bicycling, running/jogging, rafting, kayaking), focus on the arts, activist political leanings, and residents with "alternative" lifestyles. Eugene's slogan is "A Great City for the Arts and Outdoors" It is also referred to as the "Emerald City", and as "Track Town, USA" [9] The Nike corporation had its beginnings in Eugene.Eugene is named after its founder, Eugene Franklin Skinner. In 1846, Skinner erected the first cabin in the area. It was used as a trading post and was registered as an official post office on January 8, 1850. At this time the location was known as Skinner's Mudhole. Skinner founded Eugene in 1862 and later ran a ferry service across the Willamette River where the Ferry Street Bridge now stands.The first major educational institution in the area was Columbia College, founded a few years earlier than the University of Oregon. It fell victim to two major fires in four years, and after the second fire, the college decided not to rebuild again. The part of south Eugene known as College Hill was the former location of Columbia College. There is no college there today.The town raised the initial funding to start a public university, which later became the University of Oregon, with the hope of turning the small town into a center of learning. In 1872, the Legislative Assembly passed a bill creating the University of Oregon as a state institution. Eugene bested the nearby town of Albany in the competition for the state university. In 1873, community member J.H.D. Henderson donated the hilltop land for the campus, overlooking the city.The university first opened in 1876 with the regents electing the first faculty and naming John Wesley Johnson as president. The first students registered on October 16, 1876. The first building was completed in 1877; it was named Deady Hall in honor of the first Board of Regents President and community leader Judge Matthew P. Deady.Eugene grew rapidly throughout most of the twentieth century, with the exception being the early 1980s when a downturn in the timber industry caused high unemployment. By 1985, the industry had recovered and Eugene began to attract more high-tech industries.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 40.54 square miles (105.00km2),[1] with 40.50 square miles (104.89km2) of it being land and 0.04 square miles (0.10km2) (0.10%) of it is water. Eugene is located at an elevation of 426 feet (130m).To the north of downtown is Skinner Butte. Northeast of the city are the Coburg Hills. Spencer Butte is a prominent landmark south of the city. Mount Pisgah is southeast of Eugene and includes Mount Pisgah Arboretum and Howard Buford Recreation Area, a Lane County Park. Eugene is surrounded by foothills and forests to the south, east and west, while to the north the land levels out into the Willamette Valley and consists of mostly farmland.The Willamette and McKenzie rivers run through Eugene and neighboring city, Springfield. Another important stream is Amazon Creek, whose headwaters are near Spencer Butte. The creek discharges into Fern Ridge Reservoir west of the city.Eugene has 23[10] neighborhood associations:Though it is not actually part of Eugene, Glenwood is a small (unincorporated) community located between Eugene and Springfield on Franklin Blvd. (Hwy. 99), and is a neighborhood in its own right. It was once managed by Eugene, but has since been taken over by Springfield. The area, however, is separated from Springfield by the Willamette River, and though travelers must pass under Interstate 5 to reach Glenwood from Eugene, the community is assumed by most in the area to be more a part of Eugene than Springfield. Glenwood residents have Springfield phone numbers and Eugene addresses.Like the rest of the Willamette Valley, Eugene lies in the Marine West Coast climate zone (Koppen Cfb), with some Mediterranean characteristics. Temperatures can vary from cool to warm, with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Spring and fall are also moist seasons, with light rain falling for long periods. Winter snowfall does occur, but it is sporadic and rarely accumulates in large amounts: the average seasonal amount is 5 inches (12.7cm), and the median is 0.[11] The record snowfall was 3ft deep due to a pineapple express in late January 1969. Record snowfall for March was 8 inches deep in 2012.[12] The hottest months are July and August, with average highs of around 82 F (28C), with an average of 15 days per year above 90 F (32.2C). The coolest month is December, with the average daytime high in the mid-40sF (7-8C), and nights averaging just above freezing. There are 54 nights per year with a low below freezing, and about three days with highs not exceeding freezing.[11] The record high low was 73F in 2006 and 71F in 2008.Eugene's average annual temperature is 52.1 F (11.2C), and annual precipitation at 50.9 inches (1,290mm).[11] Eugene is slightly cooler on average than Portland. Despite being located about 100 miles (160km) south and having only a slightly higher elevation, Eugene has a more continental climate, less subject to the maritime air that blows inland from the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River. Eugene's average August low is 50.8 F (10.4C),[11] while Portland's average August low is 56.5 F (13.6C).[13] Average winter temperatures (and summer high temperatures) are similar for the two cities. This disparity may be additionally caused by Portland's urban heat island, where the combination of black pavement and urban energy use raises nighttime temperatures. A lesser heat island may also exist in the immediate downtown of Eugene.Extreme temperatures range from 12F (24C), recorded on December 8, 1972,[14] to 108F (42C) on August 9, 1981.[15]The combination of being in the downwind end of the Willamette Valley, the undisputed "grass-seed capital of the world"[17] and the confining shape of the hills has led to Eugene being the area of the highest grass pollen counts in the USA (>1,500 pollen grains/m 3 of air).[18] These high pollen counts have led to difficulties for some of the track athletes who compete in Eugene. In the Olympic trials in 1972, Jim Ryun won the 1,500 after being flown in by helicopter because he was allergic to Eugene's grass seed pollen.[19] Further, six-time Olympian Maria Mutola abandoned Eugene as a training area in part to avoid allergies.[20]According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Eugene's population was 156,185.[2] The population density was 3,572.2 people per square mile. There were 69,951 housing units at an average density of 1,600 per square mile.[5] Those age 18 and over accounted for 81.8% of the total population.[5]The racial makeup of the city was 90.2% White, 5.7% Asian, 2.4% Black or African American, 2.8% Native American, 0.6% Pacific Islander, and 3.4% from other races.[5]Hispanics and Latinos of any race accounted for 7.8% of the total population.[23] Of the non-Hispanics, 82% were White, 1.3% Black or African American, 0.8% Native American, 4% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 0.2% some other race alone, and 3.4% were of two or more races.[5]Females represented 51.1% of the total population, and males represented 48.9%. The median age in the city was 33.8 years.[24]The census[3] of 2000 showed that there were 137,893 people, 58,110 households, and 31,321 families residing in the city of Eugene. The population density was 3,404.8 people per square mile (1,314.5/km). There were 61,444 housing units at an average density of 1,516.4 per square mile (585.5/km). The racial makeup of the city was 88.15% White, down from 99.5% in 1950,[25] 3.57% Asian, 1.25% Black or African American, 0.93% Native American, 0.21% Pacific Islander, 2.18% from other races, and 3.72% from two or more races. 4.96% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.There were 58,110 households, of which 25.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.6% were married couples living together, 9.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.1% were non-families. 31.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.27 and the average family size was 2.87. In the city, the population was 20.3% under the age of 18, 17.3% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 21.8% from 45 to 64, and 12.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.0 males. The median income for a household in the city was $35,850, and the median income for a family was $48,527. Males had a median income of $35,549 versus $26,721 for females. The per capita income for the city was $21,315. About 8.7% of families and 17.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.8% of those under age 18 and 7.1% of those age 65 or over.Religious institutions of higher learning in Eugene include Northwest Christian University and New Hope Christian College. Northwest Christian University (formerly Northwest Christian College), founded in 1895, has ties with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). New Hope Christian College (formerly Eugene Bible College) originated with the Bible Standard Conference in 1919, which joined with Open Bible Evangelistic Association to create Open Bible Standard Churches in 1932. Eugene Bible College was started from this movement by Fred Hornshuh in 1925.[26]The Eugene area has a sizeable Mormon presence. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has three stakes, consisting of 23 congregations (wards and branches).[27] The Portland Oregon Temple is the nearest temple.[28]The Reconstructionist Temple Beth Israel is Eugene's largest Jewish congregation.[29] It was also, for many decades, Eugene's only synagogue,[30][31] until Orthodox members broke away in 1992 and formed "Congregation Ahavas Torah".[32][33]Eugene has a community of some 140 Sikhs, who have established a Sikh temple.[34]The 340-member congregation of the Unitarian Universalist Church in Eugene (UUCE) purchased the former Eugene Scottish Rite Temple in May 2010.Eugene is noted for its "community inventiveness." Many U.S. trends in community development originated here. The University of Oregon's participatory planning process, known as The Oregon Experiment, was the result of student protests in the early 1970s. The book of the same name is a major document in modern enlightenment thinking in planning and architectural circles. The process, still used by the university in modified form, was created by Christopher Alexander, whose works also directly inspired the creation of the Wiki. Some of the research for the book A Pattern Language, which inspired the Design Patterns movement and Extreme Programming, was done by Alexander in Eugene. Not coincidentally, those engineering movements also had origins here. A Pattern Language is the best-selling book on architecture and planning of all time.In the 1970s, Eugene was packed with cooperative and community projects. It still has small natural food stores in many neighborhoods, some of the oldest student cooperatives in the country, and alternative schools have been part of the school district since 1971. The old Grower's Market, downtown near the Amtrak depot, is the only food cooperative in the U.S. with no employees. It is possible to see Eugene's trend-setting non-profit tendencies in much newer projects, such as the Tango Center and the Center for Appropriate Transport. In 2006, an initiative began to create a tenant-run development process for downtown Eugene.In the fall of 2003, neighbors noticed that "an unassuming two-acre remnant orchard tucked into the Friendly Area Neighborhood"[35] had been put up for sale by its owner, a resident of New York City.[36] Learning that a prospective buyer had plans to build several houses on the property, they formed a nonprofit organization called Madison Meadow[37][38] in June 2004 in order to buy the property and "preserve it as undeveloped space in perpetuity."[37] In 2007 their effort was named Third Best Community Effort by the Eugene Weekly,[39] and by the end of 2008 they had raised enough money to purchase the property.[35]During the late 1990s and early years of the 2000s, Eugene contained a community of anarchists situated in the Whiteaker neighborhood of west Eugene. This community gained international notoriety in 1999, due to its perceived role in the protests at the WTO Conference in Seattle that year.[40] Following those protests, then-mayor Jim Torrey described the city as "the anarchist capital of the United States."[40]The Eugene anarchist movement grew out of the treesits and forest defense camps of the 1990s. Demonstrations and riots in Eugene have since occurred [41] notably during a Reclaim the Streets event on June 18, 1999, when protesters blocked downtown streets and smashed the windows of three stores. Some rioters threw stones and bottles at police.[42]One notable set of events in Eugene's anarchist community's history was the "mud people's" protest.[43] On that day, the participants noticed two blocks of trees, in a parking lot near the downtown area, were slated for removal the following Sunday. The ensuing tree sitting protest on June 1, 1997 was reported widely, as it lasted several hours before the crowd became violent[citation needed] and the police responded with pepper spray. A lawsuit by protesters against police response was settled five years later.[44]The ongoing trials of accused "eco-terrorists" continue to keep Eugene in the same spotlight.[45]Historically, Eugene has fostered the anarcho-primitivist movement. John Zerzan, a Eugene resident, is an editor of the Green Anarchy magazine, and has been associated with the growth of the green anarchist movement and associated with the philosophy behind black bloc tactics that were later found in the Seattle riots.[46][47]Eugene's largest employers are PeaceHealth Medical Group, the University of Oregon and the Eugene School District.[48] Eugene's largest industries are wood products manufacturing and recreational vehicle manufacturing.[49]The oldest retail business in downtown Eugene and one of the oldest bars in Oregon is Luckey's Club Cigar Store. It was purchased in 1911 by Tad Luckey, Sr. The Club Cigar, as it was called in the late 19th century, was for many years a men-only salon. It survived both the Great Depression and Prohibition, partly because Eugene was a dry town before the end of Prohibition.[citation needed]Emporium Department Stores, which was founded in North Bend, Oregon, had its headquarters in Eugene, but closed all stores in 2002. Corporate headquarters for the employee-owned Bi-Mart corporation and family-owned Market of Choice remain located in Eugene.Organically Grown Company, the largest distributor of organic fruits and vegetables in the northwest, started in Eugene in 1978 as a non-profit co-op for organic farmers. Notable local food processors, many of whom manufacture certified organic products, include Golden Temple (Yogi Tea), Merry Hempsters and Springfield Creamery (Nancy's Yogurt & owned by the Kesey Family)Until July, 2008, Hynix Semiconductor America had operated a large semiconductor plant in west Eugene. In late September, 2009, Uni-Chem of South Korea announced its intention to purchase the Hynix site for solar cell manufacturing.[50]The footwear repair product Shoe Goo is manufactured by Eclectic Products, based in Eugene.Eugene is the birthplace and home of Bike Friday bicycle manufacturer, Green Gear Cycling.Many multinational businesses were launched in Eugene. Some of the most famous include Nike,[51] Taco Time,[52] and Brderbund Software.[53]According to Eugene's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[48] the city's top employers are:Eugene has a significant population of people in pursuit of alternative ideas, and a large original hippie population.[54] Beginning in the 1960s, the countercultural ideas and viewpoints espoused by Ken Kesey became established as the seminal elements of the vibrant social tapestry that continue to define Eugene.[55] The Merry Prankster, as Kesey was known, has arguably left the most indelible imprint of any cultural icon in his hometown. He is best known as the author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and as the male protagonist in Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.[55]In 2005, the city council unanimously approved a new slogan for the city, "World's Greatest City for the Arts & Outdoors." While Eugene has a vibrant arts community for a city its size, and is well situated near many outdoor opportunities, this slogan was frequently criticized by locals as embarrassing and ludicrous.[56] In early 2010, the slogan was changed to "A Great City for the Arts & Outdoors."Eugene museums include the University of Oregon's Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art and Museum of Natural and Cultural History, the Oregon Air and Space Museum, Conger Street Clock Museum, Lane County Historical Museum, Maude Kerns Art Center, Shelton McMurphey Johnson House, and the Science Factory Children's Museum & Planetarium.The largest library in Oregon is the University of Oregon's Knight Library, with collections totaling more than 3 million volumes and over 100,000 audio and video items.[66] The Eugene Public Library[67] moved into a new, larger building downtown in 2002. The four-story library is an increase from 38,000 square feet (3,500m2) to 130,000 square feet (12,000m2).[68] There are also two branches of the Eugene Public Library, the Sheldon Branch Library in the neighborhood of Cal Young/Sheldon, and the Bethel Branch Library, in the neighborhood of Bethel. Eugene also has the Lane County Law Library.Eugene is home to numerous cultural organizations, including the Eugene Symphony, the Eugene Ballet, the Eugene Opera, the Eugene Concert Choir, the Northwest Christian University Community Choir, the Oregon Mozart Players, the Oregon Bach Festival, the Oregon Children's Choir, the Oregon Festival Choirs, the Eugene Youth Symphony, Ballet Fantastique and Oregon Festival of American Music. Principal performing arts venues include the Hult Center for the Performing Arts, The John G. Shedd Institute for the Arts ("The Shedd"), Matthew Knight Arena, Beall Concert Hall and the Erb Memorial Union ballroom on the University of Oregon campus, the McDonald Theatre, and W.O.W. Hall.A number of live theater groups are based in Eugene, including Free Shakespeare in the Park, Lord Leebrick Theatre, The Very Little Theatre, Actors Cabaret, LCC Theatre, and University Theatre.[69] Each has its own performance venue.Because of its status as a college town, Eugene has been home to many musicians and bands, ranging from mainstream garage rock, to hip hop, folk and heavy metal. Eugene also has a growing reggae and street-performing bluegrass and jug band scene. Multi-genre act the Cherry Poppin' Daddies became a prominent figure in Eugene's music scene and became the house band at Eugene's W.O.W. Hall. In the late 1990s, their contributions to the swing revival movement propelled them to national stardom. Rock band Floater originated in Eugene. Doom metal band YOB is among the leaders of the Eugene heavy music scene.Eugene is home to "Classical Gas" Composer and two-time Grammy award winner Mason Williams who spent his years as a youth living between his parents in Oakridge, Oregon and Oklahoma. Mason Williams puts on a yearly Christmas show at the Hult center for performing arts with a full orchestra produced by author, audio engineer and University of Oregon professor Don Latarski.[citation needed]Dick Hyman, noted jazz pianist and musical director for many of Woody Allen's films, designs and hosts the annual Now Hear This! jazz festival at the Oregon Festival of American Music (OFAM). OFAM and the Hult Center routinely draw major jazz talent for concerts.[70][71]Eugene is also home to a large Zimbabwean music community. Kutsinhira Cultural Arts Center, which is "dedicated to the music and people of Zimbabwe," is based in Eugene.Eugene's visual arts community is supported by over 20 private art galleries and several organizations, including Maude Kerns Art Center,[72] Lane Arts Council,[73] DIVA (the Downtown Initiative for the Visual Arts), the Hult Center's Jacobs Gallery,[74] and the Eugene Glass School.Annual visual arts events include the Mayor's Art Show and Art and the Vineyard.[75]The Eugene area has been used as a filming location for several Hollywood films, most famously for 1978's National Lampoon's Animal House, which was also filmed in nearby Cottage Grove. John Belushi had the idea for the film The Blues Brothers during filming of Animal House when he happened to meet Curtis Salgado at what was then the Eugene Hotel.[76]Getting Straight, starring Elliott Gould and Candice Bergen, was filmed at Lane Community College in 1969. As the campus was still under construction at the time, the "occupation scenes" were easier to shoot.[77]The "Chicken Salad on Toast" scene in the 1970 Jack Nicholson movie Five Easy Pieces was filmed at the Denny's restaurant at the southern I-5 freeway interchange near Glenwood. Nicholson directed the 1971 film Drive, He Said in Eugene.How to Beat the High Co$t of Living, starring Jane Curtin, Jessica Lange and Susan St. James, was filmed in Eugene in the fall of 1979. Locations included Valley River Center, Skinner Butte, the Willamette River and River Road Hardware.Several track and field movies have used Eugene as a setting and/or a filming location. Personal Best, starring Mariel Hemingway, was filmed in Eugene in 1982. The film centered on a group of women who are trying to qualify for the Olympic track and field team. Two track and field movies about the life of Steve Prefontaine, Prefontaine and Without Limits were released within a year of each other in 1997-1998. Kenny Moore, Eugene-trained Olympic runner and co-star in Prefontaine, co-wrote the screenplay for Without Limits. Prefontaine was filmed in Washington because the Without Limits production bought out Hayward Field for the summer to prevent its competition from shooting there.[citation needed] Kenny Moore also wrote a biography of Bill Bowerman, played in Without Limits by Donald Sutherland.Stealing Time, a 2003 independent film, was partially filmed in Eugene. When the film premiered in June 2001 at the Seattle International Film Festival, it was titled Rennie's Landing after a popular bar near the University of Oregon campus. The title was changed for its DVD release. Zerophilia was filmed in Eugene in 2006.Eugene's Oregon Ducks are part of the Pacific-12 Conference (Pac-12). American football is especially popular, with intense rivalries between the Ducks and both the Oregon State University Beavers and the University of Washington Huskies.[78] Autzen Stadium is home to Duck football, with a seating capacity of 54,000.[79]The basketball arena, McArthur Court, was built in 1926.[80] The arena was replaced by the Matthew Knight Arena in late 2010.[81]For nearly 40 years, Eugene has been the "Track and Field Capital of the World."

Jogging was introduced to the U.S. through Eugene, brought from New Zealand by Bill Bowerman, who wrote the best-selling book "Jogging", and coached the champion University of Oregon track and cross country teams. During Bowerman's tenure, his "Men of Oregon" won 24 individual NCAA titles, including titles in 15 out of the 19 events contested. During Bowerman's 24 years at Oregon, his track teams finished in the top ten at the NCAA championships 16 times, including four team titles (1962, '64, '65, '70), and two second-place trophies. His teams also posted a dual meet record of 114-20.Bowerman also invented the waffle sole for running shoes in Eugene, and with Oregon alumnus Phil Knight founded shoe giant Nike, Inc. Eugene's miles of running trails, through its unusually large park system, are the most extensive in the U.S. The city has dozens of running clubs. The climate is cool and temperate, good both for jogging and record-setting. Eugene is home to the University of Oregon's Hayward Field track, which hosts numerous collegiate and amateur track and field meets throughout the year, most notably the Prefontaine Classic. Hayward Field was host to the 2004 AAU Junior Olympic Games, the 2006 Pacific-10 track and field championships, and the 1972, 1976, 1980, 2008, and 2012 U.S. Olympic track and field trials.Eugene is also home to the Eugene Emeralds, a short-season Class A minor-league baseball team.

Wyle was the only major cast member of ER to have been with the show since its inception (1994) when he left after its eleventh season (2005). His performances on the show earned him Emmy Award nominations in each of its first five seasons. As part of an ensemble he was nominated several times for the Screen Actors Guild Award, he was recognized with three Golden Globe nominations as Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television and won the 2001 TV Guide Award for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Wyle left the series at the end of the eleventh season, although he returned in guest appearances for a four-episode arc during the twelfth season. He stated that he left because he wanted to spend more time with his family and friends and to make room for the upcoming generation.[citation needed] However, in 2009, Wyle returned to ER during its fifteenth and final season for five episodes, including the series finale. According to the Guinness World Records 2005 Special 50th Anniversary Edition, Wyle became the holder of a "Highest paid TV drama actor per episode" record during the 2003-2004 tenth season, earning approximately $400,000 per episode.

Together, they have a son, Owen Strausser Speer Wyle (born November 9, 2002), and a daughter, Auden Wyle (born October 15, 2005). Warbin's pregnancy with Auden was announced on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.Wyle bought Bo Derek's ranch in Santa Ynez Valley, California, in June 1999, for approximately $2.5 million. They listed their Los Feliz (Los Angeles) home at close to $4.4 million. The traditional-style house was designed by architect Paul Williams, was built in 1934 and has a theater, a detached guest house-office and a landscaped yard with city views, a pool, a koi pond, a patio and a fire pit.Wyle and Warbin, his wife of almost ten years, separated in late October 2009, according to People magazine. The couple live in separate residences, and both see their two children daily.[13]In 1999, Wyle made an appearance during the beginning of Steve Jobs's Macworld Expo keynote presentation, initially pretending to be Jobs. When the audience caught on, Jobs himself appeared and began to banter with Wyle.[14][15] It was a practical joke by Jobs and Wyle in light of the movie Pirates of Silicon Valley.Wyle devotes much of his free time to the international non-profit organization Doctors of the World and to his work as a member of the Human Rights Watch Council.

Silvio Berlusconi (Italian pronunciation:[silvjo berluskoni]( listen); born 29 September 1936) is an Italian politician and media tycoon who served three times as Prime Minister of Italy: from 1994 to 1995, 2001 to 2006 and 2008 to 2011. Berlusconi is also the controlling shareholder of Mediaset and owner of A.C. Milan. He is nicknamed Il Cavaliere (The Knight) for his Order of Merit for Labour. Berlusconi is the longest-serving post-war Prime Minister of Italy, and third longest-serving since the Unification of Italy, after Benito Mussolini and Giovanni Giolitti, holding three separate terms. Technically, he has been sworn in four times because after a cabinet reshuffle, as happened with Berlusconi in 2005, the new ministry is sworn in and subjected to a vote of confidence. He is the leader of the People of Freedom political movement, a centre-right party he founded in 2009. From November 2009 to November 2011, he was the most senior leader of the G8 countries. In 2012, Forbes magazine ranked him as the 169th richest man in the world with a net worth of US$5.9 billion.[2]Berlusconi's political rise was rapid. He was elected as a Member of the Chamber of Deputies for the first time and appointed as Prime Minister following the March 1994 parliamentary elections, when Forza Italia gained a relative majority a mere three months after having been officially launched. However, his cabinet collapsed after nine months, due to internal disagreements in his coalition. In the April 1996 snap parliamentary elections, Berlusconi was defeated by the centre-left candidate Romano Prodi. In the May 2001 parliamentary elections, he was again the centre-right candidate for Prime Minister and won against the centre-left candidate Francesco Rutelli. Berlusconi then formed his second and third cabinets, until 2006. Berlusconi was leader of the centre-right coalition in the April 2006 parliamentary elections, which he lost by a very narrow margin, his opponent again being Romano Prodi. He was re-elected in the parliamentary elections of April 2008 following the collapse of Prodi's government and sworn in for a third time as Prime Minister on 8 May 2008.Berlusconi's terms in office were controversial. Berlusconi was criticised for his electoral coalitions with the xenophobic Lega Nord and the post-fascist National Alliance and for his apologist rhetoric about Italian Fascism and Benito Mussolini. Yet although Berlusconi allied with the National Alliance and gave controversial appraisements of Mussolini, he went to Libya in 2008 to provide an official apology and financial compensation from Italy to Libya for the brutalities of Italian colonial rule, especially regarding the repressive actions of the Pacification of Libya during the Fascist era.[3] Berlusconi's agreement with Libya was unprecedented in that it made Italy the first country to ever offer substantial financial compensation to an ex-colony on the basis of recognition of injustice of the colonial rule.[3] His leadership was undermined by sex scandals.[4]After losing his majority in parliament amid growing fiscal problems related to the European debt crisis, Berlusconi officially resigned as Prime Minister on 16 November 2011.[5] According to media reports, Berlusconi wants to make a comeback as PM and is preparing himself as the head of the party for elections to be held in 2013.[6] On 26 October 2012, Berlusconi was convicted of fraud by an Italian court for tax evasion.[7] He remains free and is expected to appeal the decision.[8]Berlusconi was born in Milan in 1936, where he was raised in a middle-class family.[9] His father, Luigi Berlusconi (19081989) was a bank employee and his mother, Rosa Bossi (19112008), a housewife.[10] Silvio was the first of three children; he had a sister, Maria Francesca Antonietta Berlusconi (19432009) and has a brother, Paolo Berlusconi (born 1949), both entrepreneurs.[citation needed]After completing his secondary school education at a Salesian college, he studied law at the Universit Statale in Milan, graduating (with honours) in 1961 with a thesis on the legal aspects of advertising. Berlusconi was not required to serve the standard one-year stint in the Italian army which was compulsory at the time.[11] During his university studies he was an upright bass player in a group formed with the now Mediaset Chairman and amateur pianist Fedele Confalonieri and occasionally performed as a cruise ship crooner. In later life he wrote AC Milan's anthem with the Italian music producer and pop singer Tony Renis and Forza Italia's anthem with the opera director Renato Serio. With the Neapolitan singer Mariano Apicella he wrote two Neapolitan song albums: Meglio 'na canzone in 2003 and L'ultimo amore in 2006.In 1965, he married Carla Elvira Dall'Oglio, and they had two children: Maria Elvira, better known as Marina (born 1966), and Pier Silvio (born 1969).[citation needed] By 1980, Berlusconi had established a relationship with the actress Veronica Lario (born Miriam Bartolini), with whom he subsequently had three children: Barbara (born 1984), Eleonora (born 1986) and Luigi (born 1988). He was divorced from Dall'Oglio in 1985, and married Lario in 1990. By this time, Berlusconi was a well-known entrepreneur, and his wedding was a notable social event. One of his best men was former Prime Minister and leader of the Italian Socialist Party Bettino Craxi. In May 2009, Lario announced that she was to file for divorce.[12]In 2012, Forbes magazine reported that Berlusconi was Italy's sixth richest man, with a net worth of $5.9billion. He holds significant assets in television, newspaper, publishing, cinema, finance, banking, insurance, and sports.[13] Berlusconi's main company, Mediaset, operates three national television channels covering half of the national television sector; and Publitalia (it), the leading Italian advertising and publicity agency. Berlusconi also owns a controlling stake in Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, the largest Italian publishing house, whose publications include Panorama, one of the country's most popular news magazines. His brother, Paolo Berlusconi, owns and operates il Giornale, a centre-right wing newspaper which provides a pro-Berlusconi slant on Italian politics. Il Foglio, one of the most influential Italian right-wing newspapers, is partially owned by his wife, Veronica Lario. After Lario sold some of her ownership in 2010, Paolo Berlusconi acquired a majority interest in the newspaper. Berlusconi is also the founder and major shareholder of Fininvest, which is among the largest private companies in Italy[14] and operates in media and finance. With Ennio Doris he founded Mediolanum, one of the country's biggest banking and insurance groups. He has interests in cinema and home video distribution (Medusa Film and Penta Film). He is also the owner of the football club A.C. Milan which along with Boca Juniors has won the most FIFA recognized international club titles in the world. After his resignation as prime minister of Italy, he announced that he will return as president of A.C. Milan in 2012.[15]Berlusconi's business career began in construction. In the late 1960s he built Milano Due (Italian for 'Milan Two'), 4,000 residential apartments east of Milan. The profits from this venture provided the seed money for his advertising agency.[16]Berlusconi first entered the media world in 1973 by setting up a small cable television company, 'Telemilano', to service units built on his Segrate properties. It began transmitting in September the following year. After buying two further channels, Berlusconi relocated the station to central Milan in 1977 and began broadcasting over the airwaves.[17]In 1978 Berlusconi founded his first media group, Fininvest, and joined the Propaganda Due masonic lodge. In the five years leading up to 1983 he earned some 113billion Italian lire (58.3million). The funding sources are still unknown because of a complex system of holding companies, despite investigations conducted by various state attorneys.Fininvest soon expanded into a country-wide network of local TV stations which had similar programming, forming, in effect, a single national network. This was seen as breaching the Italian public broadcaster RAI's statutory monopoly by creating a national network, which was later abolished. In 1980, Berlusconi founded Italy's first private national network, Canale 5, followed shortly thereafter by Italia 1 which was bought from the Rusconi family in 1982, and Rete 4, which was bought from Mondadori in 1984.[18]Berlusconi created the first and only Italian commercial TV empire. He was assisted by his connections to Bettino Craxi, secretary-general of the Italian Socialist Party and also prime minister of Italy at that time, whose government passed, on 20 October 1984, an emergency decree legalising the nationwide transmissions made by Berlusconi's television stations.[18] This was in response to judgements on 16 October 1984 in Turin, Pescara and Rome, enforcing a law which previously restricted nationwide broadcasting to RAI, that had ordered these private networks to cease transmitting.After political turmoil in 1985 the decree was approved definitively. But for some years, Berlusconi's three channels remained in a legal limbo, and were not allowed to broadcast news and political commentary. They were elevated to the status of full national TV channels in 1990 by the so-called Mamm law.In 1995, Berlusconi sold a portion of his media holdings, first to the German media group Kirch Group (now bankrupt) and then by public offer. In 1999 Berlusconi expanded his media interests by forming a partnership with Kirch called the Epsilon MediaGroup.[19]On 9 July, a Milan court ordered Fininvest to pay 560 million euros in damages to Compagnie Industriali Riunite in a long-running legal dispute.[20]The political career of Silvio Berlusconi began in 1994, when he entered politics, subsequently serving as Prime Minister of Italy from 1994 to 1995, 2001 to 2006, and 2008 to 2011. His career was racked with controversies and trials; amongst these was his failure to honour his promise to sell his personal assets in Mediaset, the largest television broadcaster in Italy, in order to dispel any perceived conflicts of interest.In the early 1990s, the Pentapartito (it) - the five governing parties, Christian Democracy (Democrazia Cristiana), the Italian Socialist Party, the Italian Social-Democratic Party, the Italian Republican Party and the Italian Liberal Party - lost much of their electoral strength almost overnight due to a large number of judicial investigations concerning the financial corruption of many of their foremost members (see the Mani Pulite affair). This led to a general expectation that upcoming elections would be won by the Democratic Party of the Left, the heirs to the former Italian Communist Party, and their Alliance of Progressives coalition - unless an alternative arose. On 26 January 1994, Berlusconi announced his decision to enter politics, ("enter the field", in his own words) presenting his own political party, Forza Italia, on a platform focused on defeating the Communists. His political aim was to convince the voters of the Pentapartito, who were shocked and confused by Mani Pulite scandals, that Forza Italia offered both a fresh uniqueness and the continuation of the pro-western free market policies followed by Italy since the end of the Second World War. Shortly after he decided to enter the political arena, investigators into the Mani Pulite affair were said to be close to issuing warrants for the arrest of Berlusconi and senior executives of his business group. During his political career Berlusconi repeatedly stated that the Mani Pulite investigations were led by communist prosecutors who wanted to establish a soviet-style government in Italy.[21][22]In order to win the March 1994 general election Berlusconi formed two separate electoral alliances: Pole of Freedoms (Polo delle Libert) with the Lega Nord (Northern League) in northern Italian districts, and another, the Pole of Good Government (Polo del Buon Governo), with the post-fascist National Alliance (Alleanza Nazionale; heir to the Italian Social Movement) in central and southern regions.[23] In a shrewd pragmatic move, he did not ally with the latter in the North because the League disliked them. As a result, Forza Italia was allied with two parties that were not allied with each other.Berlusconi launched a massive campaign of electoral advertisements on his three TV networks. He subsequently won the elections, with Forza Italia garnering 21% of the popular vote, the highest percentage of any single party.[24] One of the most significant promises that he made in order to secure victory was that his government would create "one million more jobs". He was appointed Prime Minister in 1994, but his term in office was short because of the inherent contradictions in his coalition: the League, a regional party with a strong electoral base in northern Italy, was at that time fluctuating between federalist and separatist positions, and the National Alliance was a nationalist party that had yet to renounce neo-fascism at the time.In December 1994, following the leaking to the press of news of a fresh investigation by Milan magistrates, Umberto Bossi, leader of the Lega Nord, left the coalition claiming that the electoral pact had not been respected, forcing Berlusconi to resign from office and shifting the majority's weight to the centre-left. Lega Nord also resented the fact that many of its MPs had switched to Forza Italia, allegedly lured by promises of more prestigious portfolios. In 1998 various articles attacking Berlusconi were published by Lega Nord's official newspaper (www.lapadania.it), with titles such as "La Fininvest  nata da Cosa Nostra" "Fininvest (Berlusconi's principal company) was founded by the Mafia".Berlusconi remained as caretaker prime minister for a little over a month, until his replacement by a technocratic government headed by Lamberto Dini. Dini had been a key minister in the Berlusconi cabinet, and Berlusconi said the only way he would support a technocratic government would be if Dini headed it. In the end, however, Dini was only supported by most opposition parties but not by Forza Italia and Lega Nord. In 1996, Berlusconi and his coalition lost the elections and were replaced by a centre-left government led by Romano Prodi.[25]In 2001 Berlusconi ran again, as leader of the right-wing coalition House of Freedoms (Italian: La Casa delle Libert), which included the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, the Lega Nord, the National Alliance and other parties. Berlusconi's success in the May 2001 general election led to him becoming Prime Minister once more, with the coalition receiving 45.4% of the vote for the Chamber of Deputies and 42.5% for the Senate.On the television interviews programme Porta a Porta, during the last days of the electoral campaign, Berlusconi created a powerful impression on the public by undertaking to sign a so-called Contratto con gli Italiani (English: Contract with the Italians), an idea copied outright by his advisor Luigi Crespi from Newt Gingrich's Contract with America introduced six weeks before the 1994 US Congressional election.[26] This was considered to be a creative masterstroke in his 2001 bid for prime ministership. Berlusconi committed in this contract to improve several aspects of the Italian economy and life. Firstly, he undertook to simplify the complex tax system by introducing just two tax rates (33% for those earning over 100,000 euros, and 23% for anyone earning less than that figure: anyone earning less than 11,000 euros a year would not be taxed). Secondly, he promised to halve the unemployment rate. Thirdly, he undertook to finance and develop a massive new public works programme. Fourthly, he promised to raise the minimum monthly pension rate to 516 euros. Fifthly, he would suppress the crime wave by introducing police officers to patrol all local zones and areas in Italy's major cities.[27] Berlusconi undertook to refrain from putting himself up for re-election in 2006 if he failed to honour at least four of these five promises.Opposition parties claim Berlusconi was not able to achieve the goals he promised in his Contratto con gli Italiani. Some of his partners in government, especially the National Alliance and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, admitted the Government fell short of the promises made in the agreement, attributing the failure to an unforeseeable downturn in global economic conditions. Berlusconi himself consistently asserted that he achieved all the goals of the agreement, and said his Government provided un miracolo continuo (a continuous miracle) that made all 'earlier governments pale' (by comparison). He attributed the widespread failure to recognize these achievements to a campaign of mystification and vilification in the printed media, asserting that 85% of newspapers were opposed to him.[28] Luca Ricolfi, an independent analyst, held that Berlusconi had managed to deliver only one promise out of five, the one concerning minimum pension levels. The other four promises were not, in Luca Ricolfi's view, honoured, in particular, the undertakings on the tax simplification and the reduction of crime.[29]House of Freedoms did not do as well in the 2003 local elections as it did in the 2001 national elections. In common with many other European governing groups, in the 2004 elections of the European Parliament, gaining 43.37% support. Forza Italia's support was also reduced from 29.5% to 21.0% (in the 1999 European elections Forza Italia had 25.2%). As an outcome of these results the other coalition parties, whose electoral results were more satisfactory, asked Berlusconi and Forza Italia for greater influence in the government's political line.In the 2005 regional elections (3 April/4 April 2005), the centre-left gubernatorial candidates won in 12 out of 14 regions where control of local governments and governorships was at stake. Berlusconi's coalition held only two of the regional bodies (Lombardy and Veneto) up for re-election. Three parties, Union of Christian and Centre Democrats, National Alliance and New Italian Socialist Party, threatened to withdraw from the Berlusconi government. The Italian Premier, after some hesitation, then presented to the President of the Republic a request for the dissolution of his government on 20 April 2005. On 23 April he formed a new government with the same allies, reshuffling ministers and amending the government programme. A key point demanded by the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (and to a lesser extent by National Alliance) for their continued support was that the strong focus on tax reduction central to the government's ambitions be changed.A key point in the Berlusconi government's programme was a planned reform of the Italian Constitution, which Berlusconi considered to be 'inspired by [the] Soviets',[30] an issue the coalition parties themselves initially had significantly different opinions about. The Lega Nord insisted on a federalist reform (devolution of more power to the regions) as a condition for remaining in the coalition. The National Alliance party pushed for a so-called 'strong premiership' (more powers to the executive), intended as a counterweight to any federalist reform, in order to preserve the integrity of the nation. The Union of Christian and Centre Democrats asked for a proportional electoral law that would not damage small parties, and was generally more willing to discuss compromises with the moderate wing of the opposition.Difficulties in arranging a mediation caused some internal unrest in the Berlusconi government in 2003, but then they were mostly overcome and the law (comprising power devolution to the regions, Federal Senate and "strong premiership") was passed by the Senate in April 2004; it was slightly modified by the Chamber of Deputies in October 2004, and again on October 2005, and finally approved by the Senate on 16 November 2005 with a bare majority. Approval in a referendum is necessary in order to amend the Italian Constitution without a qualified two-thirds parliamentary majority. The referendum was held on 2526 July 2006 and resulted in the rejection of the constitutional reform, refused by 61.3% of the voters.Operating under a new electoral law written unilaterally by the governing parties over strong criticism from the parliamentary opposition, the April 2006 general election was held. The results of this election handed Romano Prodi's centre-left coalition, known as The Union, (Berlusconi's opposition) a very thin majority: 49.8% against 49.7% for the centre-right coalition House of Freedoms in the Lower House, and a two-senator lead in the Senate (158 senators for The Union and 156 for the House of Freedoms). The Court of Cassation subsequently validated the voting procedures and determined that the election process was constitutional.According to the new electoral rules, The Union, (nicknamed "The Soviet Union" by Silvio Berlusconi[31]) with a margin of only 25,224 votes (out of over 38 million voters), nevertheless won 348 seats (compared to 281 for the House of Freedoms) in the lower house as a result of a majority premium given to whichever coalition of parties was awarded more votes.Ironically, this electoral law, approved shortly before the election by Berlusconi's coalition in an attempt to improve their chances of winning the election, led to the coalition's defeat and gave Prodi the chance to form a new cabinet. However, Prodi's coalition consisted of a large number of smaller parties. If only one of these nine parties that formed The Union withdrew its support to Prodi, his government would have collapsed. This situation was also the result of the new "diabolic" electoral system.[32]Centrist parties such as the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats immediately conceded The Union's victory, while other parties, like Berlusconi's Forza Italia and the Northern League, refused to accept its validity, right up until 2 May 2006, when Berlusconi submitted his resignation to President Ciampi.[33]In the run-up to the 2006 general election, there had been talk among some of the coalition members of the House of Freedoms about a possible merger into a "united party of moderates and reformers". Forza Italia, the National Alliance party of Gianfranco Fini, and the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats of Pier Ferdinando Casini all seemed interested in the project. Soon after the election, however, Casini started to distance his party from its historical allies.On 2 December 2006, during a major demonstration of the centre-right in Rome against the government led by Romano Prodi, Silvio Berlusconi proposed the foundation of a "Freedom Party", arguing that the people and voters of the different political movements aligned to the demonstration were all part of a "people of freedom".On 18 November 2007, after claiming the collection of more than 7 million signatures (including that of Umberto Bossi) demanding that the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano call a fresh election,[34] Berlusconi announced from the running board of a car in a crowded Piazza San Babila in Milan[35] that Forza Italia would soon merge or transform into The People of Freedom party, also known as the PdL (Il Popolo della Libert).[36][37][38] Berlusconi also stated that this new political movement could include the participation of other parties.[39] Both supporters and critics of the new party called Berlusconi's announcement "the running board revolution".[40][41][42]After the sudden fall of the Prodi II Cabinet on 24 January, the break-up of The Union coalition and the subsequent political crisis (which paved the way for a fresh general election on April 2008), Berlusconi, Gianfranco Fini and other party leaders finally agreed on 8 February 2008 to form a joint list named The People of Freedom (Italian: Il Popolo della Libert), allied with the Lega Nord of Umberto Bossi and with the Sicilian Movement for Autonomy of Raffaele Lombardo.[43]In the snap parliamentary elections held on 13/14 April 2008 this coalition won against Walter Veltroni's centre-left coalition in both houses of the Italian Parliament.In the 315-member Senate of the Republic, Berlusconi's coalition won 174 seats to Veltroni's 134. In the lower house, Berlusconi's conservative bloc led by a margin of 9% of the vote: 46.5% (344 seats) to 37.5% (246 seats). Berlusconi capitalised on discontent over the nation's stagnating economy and the unpopularity of Prodi's government. His declared top priorities were to remove piles of trash from the streets of Naples and to improve the state of the Italian economy, which had underperformed the rest of the Eurozone for years. He also said he was open to working with the opposition, and pledged to fight tax evasion, reform justice and reduce public debt. He intended to reduce the number of Cabinet ministers to 12.[44] Berlusconi and his ministers (Berlusconi IV Cabinet) were sworn in on 8 May 2008.[45]On 21 November 2008 the National Council of Forza Italia, chaired by Alfredo Biondi and attended by Berlusconi himself, dissolved Forza Italia and established The People of Freedom, whose official inauguration took place on 27 March 2009, the 15th anniversary of Berlusconi's first electoral victory.While Forza Italia had never held a formal party congress to formulate its rules, procedures, and democratic balloting for candidates and issues, (since 1994 three party conventions of Forza Italia have been held, all of them resolving to support Berlusconi and reelecting him by acclamation) on 27 March 2009 at the foundation congress of the People of Freedom political movement the statute of the new party was subject to a vote of approval. On 5,820 voting delegates, 5,811 voted in favour, 4 against and 5 abstained.[46] During that political congress Berlusconi was elected as Chairman of the People of Freedom by handraising. According to the official minutes of the congress the result favoured Berlusconi, with 100 per cent of the delegates voting for him.[47][48][49]Between 2009 and 2010 Gianfranco Fini, former leader of the national conservative National Alliance (AN) and President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, became a vocal critic of the leadership of Berlusconi. Fini departed from party's majority line on several issues but, most of all, he was a proponent of a more structured party organisation. His criticism was aimed at the leadership style of Berlusconi, who tends to rely on his personal charisma to lead the party from the centre and supports a less structured form of party, a movement-party that organises itself only at election times.[50]On 15 April 2010 an association named Generation Italy was launched in order to better represent Fini's views within the party and push for a different party organisation.[51] On 22 April 2010 the National Committee of the PdL convened in Rome for the first time in a year. The conflict between Fini and Berlusconi was covered live on television. At the end of the day, a resolution proposed by Berlusconi's loyalists was put before the assembly and approved by a landslide margin.[52] On 29 July 2010 the party executive released a document in which Fini was described as "incompatible" with the political line of the PdL and unable to perform his job of President of the Chamber of Deputies in a neutral way. Berlusconi asked Fini to step down, and the executive proposed the suspension from party membership of three MPs who had harshly criticized Berlusconi and accused some party members of criminal offences.[53] As response, Fini and his followers formed their own groups in both chambers under the name of Future and Freedom (FLI).[54][55][56][57] It was soon clear that FLI would leave the PdL and become an independent party. On 7 November, during a convention in Bastia Umbra, Fini asked Berlusconi to step down from his post of Prime Minister and proposed a new government including the Union of the Centre (UdC).[58] A few days later, the four FLI members of the government resigned.[59] On 14 December FLI voted against Berlusconi in a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, a vote nonetheless won by Berlusconi by 314 to 311.[60][61]In May 2011 PdL suffered a big blow in local elections. Particularly painful was the loss of Milan, Berlusconi's hometown and party stronghold.[62] In response to this and to conflicts within party ranks, Angelino Alfano, the Justice minister, was chosen as national secretary in charge of reorganising and renewing the party.[63] The appointment of 40-year old Alfano, a former Christian Democrat and later leader of Forza Italia in Sicily, was unanimously decided by the party executive. On 1 July the National Council modified the party's constitution and Alfano was elected secretary almost unanimously. In his acceptance speech, Alfano proposed the introduction of primaries.[64]Berlusconi and his cabinets have had a strong tendency to support American foreign policies,[65] despite the policy divide between the U.S. and many founding members of the European Union (Germany, France, Belgium) during the Bush administration.[66] Under Berlusconi's lead, the Italian Government also shifted its traditional position on foreign policy from being the most pro-Arab western government towards a greater friendship with Israel and Turkey than in the past.[citation needed] (Silvio Berlusconi acted as wedding witness for the son of the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoan.)[67] This resulted in a rebalancing of relations between all the Mediterranean countries, to reach equal closeness with them. Berlusconi is one of the strongest supporters of Turkey's application to accede to the European Union.[68] In order to support Turkey's application the Italian Premier invited Prime Minister Erdoan to take part in a meeting of the European leaders of Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, gathered in L'Aquila for the 2009 G8 summit .[69][70] Italy, with Berlusconi in office, became a solid ally of the United States due to his support in the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War following the 2003 invasion of Iraq in the War on Terror.Berlusconi, in his meetings with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and U.S. President George W. Bush, said that he pushed for "a clear turnaround in the Iraqi situation" and for a quick handover of sovereignty to the government chosen by the Iraqi people.[citation needed] Italy had some 3,200 troops deployed in Southern Iraq, the third largest contingent there after the American and British forces.[citation needed] Italian troops were gradually withdrawn from Iraq in the second half of 2006 with the last soldiers leaving the country in December of that year.Berlusconi has a warm relationship with Vladimir Putin.[71]In November 2007, Italy's state-owned energy company Eni signed an agreement with Russian state-owned Gazprom to build the South Stream pipeline.[72] Investigating Italian parliament members discovered that Central Energy Italian Gas Holding (CEIGH), a part of the Centrex Group, was to play a major role in the lucrative agreement. Bruno Mentasti-Granelli, a close friend of Berlusconi, owned 33 percent of CEIGH. The Italian parliament blocked the contract and accused Berlusconi of having a personal interest in the Eni-Gazprom agreement.[72][73]The various cabinets chaired by Silvio Berlusconi have enhanced and strengthened the ties between Italy and Russia, which were already substantial in the Soviet Union period - during the Cold War, Italy had the strongest communist party in western Europe.[citation needed] Vladimir Putin has many times expressed his appreciation for the respect shown by the Italian Prime Minister towards the leadership of the Russian Federation.[citation needed] Berlusconi is among the most vocal supporters of closer ties between Russia and the European Union. In an article published in Italian media on 26 May 2002, he said that the next step in Russia's growing integration with the West should be EU membership.[74] On 17 November 2005 Berlusconi commented, in relation to the prospect of such membership, that he is "convinced that even if it is a dream ... it is not too distant a dream and I think it will happen one day."[75] The Prime Minister of Italy has made similar comments on other occasions as well.[76]On 1 December 2010, Wikileaks leaked American state diplomatic cables showing that American officials voiced concerns over Berlusconi's extraordinary closeness to Putin, "including 'lavish gifts,' lucrative energy contracts and a 'shadowy' Russian-speaking Italian go-between". Diplomats considered him "to be the mouthpiece of Putin" in Europe.[77] According to one of the leaked cables, the Georgian ambassador in Rome told American officials that Georgia believes Putin has promised Berlusconi a percentage of profits from any pipelines developed by Gazprom in coordination with Eni S.p.A..[78]Berlusconi visited Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus in 2009. Berlusconi became the first Western leader to visit Lukashenko since Lukashenko came to power in 1994. At a press conference, Berlusconi paid compliments to Lukashenko and said "Good luck to you and your people, whom I know love you".[79][80]On 30 August 2008, the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi signed a historic cooperation treaty in Benghazi.[81][82][83] Under its terms, Italy would pay $5 billion to Libya as compensation for its former military occupation. In exchange, Libya would take measures to combat illegal immigration coming from its shores and boost investment in Italian companies.[82][84] The treaty was ratified by Italy in 6 February 2009,[81] and by Libya on 2 March, during a visit to Tripoli by Berlusconi.[82][85] In June Gaddafi made his first visit to Rome, where he met Prime Minister Berlusconi, Italian President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano and Senate's Speaker Renato Schifani.[82] Gaddafi also took part in the G8 summit in L'Aquila in July as Chairman of the African Union.[82] During the summit a warm handshake between US President Barack Obama and Muammar Gaddafi took place (the first time the Libyan leader has been greeted by a serving US president).[86] Later, at the summit's official dinner hosted by President Giorgio Napolitano, US and Libyan leaders upset protocol by sitting next to Italian Prime Minister and G8 host Berlusconi. (According to protocol, Gaddafi should have sat three places away from Berlusconi.)[87][88][89]On 10 October the Chamber of Deputies rejected the law on the budget of the State proposed by the government.[90] As a result of this event Berlusconi moved for a confidence vote in the Chamber on 14 October, he won the vote with just 316 votes to 310, minimum required to retain a majority.[91] An increasing number of Deputies continued to cross the floor and join the opposition and on 8 November the Chamber approved the law on the budget of the State previously rejected but with only 308 votes, while opposition parties didn't participate in the vote to highlight that Berlusconi lost his majority.[92] After the vote, Berlusconi announced his resignation after Parliament passed economic reforms.[93] Among other things, his perceived failure to tackle Italy's debt crisis with an estimated debt sum of  1.9 trillion ($ 2.6 trillion) had urged Berlusconi to leave office. The popularity of this decision was reflected in the fact that while he was resigning crowds sang the hallelujah portion of George Frederick Handel's "Messiah", complete with some vocal accompaniment; there was also dancing in the streets outside the Quirinal Palace, the official residence of the President of Italy, where Berlusconi went to tender his resignation.[94]The austerity package was passed, it will raise 59.8billion in savings from spending cuts and tax raises, including freezing public-sector salaries until 2014 and gradually increasing the retirement age for women in the private sector from 60 in 2014 to 65 in 2026.[95] The resignation also came at a difficult time for Berlusconi, as he was involved in numerous trials for corruption, fraud and sex offences. He was often found guilty in lower courts but used loopholes in Italy's legal system to evade incarceration.[95]Berlusconi had also failed to meet some of his pre-election promises and had failed to prevent economic decline and introduce serious reforms.[95] Many believed that the problems and doubts over Berlusconi's leadership and his coalition were one of the factors that contributed to market anxieties over an imminent Italian financial disaster, which could have a potentially catastrophic effect on the 17-nation eurozone and the world economy.[96] Many critics of Berlusconi accused him of using his power primarily to protect his own business ventures.[95] Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, a partner in Berlusconi's right-wing coalition, was quoted as informing reporters outside parliament, "We asked the prime minister to step aside."[97]On 12 November 2011, after a final meeting with his cabinet, Berlusconi met Italian president Giorgio Napolitano at the Palazzo del Quirinale to tend his resignation.[98] Following Berlusconi's resignation, Mario Monti formed a new government that would remain in office until the next scheduled elections in 2013.[99][100] On 16 November, Monti announced that he had formed a Cabinet and was officially sworn in as Prime Minister of Italy, also appointing himself as Minister of Economy and Finance.[101]Silvio Berlusconi has an extensive record of criminal allegations, including mafia collusion, false accounting, tax fraud, corruption and bribery of police officers and judges. Berlusconi has been tried in Italian courts in several cases. In three of these cases accusations were dropped by the judiciary because of laws passed by Berlusconi's parliamentary majority shortening the time limit for prosecution of various offences and making false accounting illegal only if there is a specific damaged party reporting the fact to the authorities.[102][103] In all of them, but one, either he was acquitted by a court of first instance or on appeal, or charges were dropped because the statute of limitations had expired. Therefore he has not been sentenced up to now, despite having been found guilty of providing false testimony in 1990.[104][105][106][107][108] Berlusconi claimed that "this is a manifest judicial persecution, against which I am proud to resist, and the fact that my resistance and sacrifice will give the Italians a more fair and efficient judicial system makes me even more proud",[109] and added that "789 prosecutors and magistrates took an interest in the politician Berlusconi from 1994 to 2006 with the aim of subverting the votes of the Italian people" citing statistics that he said have constituted a "calvary including 577 visits by police, 2,500 court hearings and 174million euros in lawyers' bills paid by me".[110][111] Berlusconi has always been able to afford top lawyers and publicists, for example Nicolas Sarkozy was one of his French top defenders.[112][113][114] Some of his former prosecutors later joined the parliamentary opposition. Some of his attorneys are also members of parliament.In 1981, a scandal arose after the police discovery of Licio Gelli's secret quasi-Masonic lodge Propaganda 2 (P2), which aimed to change the Italian political system to a more authoritarian regime. The list of people involved in P2 included members of the secret services and some prominent characters from political arena, business, military and media. Silvio Berlusconi, who was then just starting to gain popularity as the founder and owner of "Canale 5" TV channel, was listed as a member of P2.[115][116] The P2 lodge was dissolved by the Italian Parliament in December 1981 and a law was passed declaring similar organisations illegal, but no specific crimes were alleged against individual members of the P2 lodge. While the Italian Constitution had forbidden secret associations since 1948, no penal law provision had ever been passed by Parliament to enact that, and in the Italian legal system an action cannot be a crime if no law declaring that action a crime was in force when the action was committed. Thus, members of the P2 were members of an illegal but not criminal association.Berlusconi later (in 1989) sued three journalists for libel for writing articles hinting at his involvement in financial crimes. In court, he declared that he had joined the P2 lodge "only for a very short time before the scandal broke" and "he had not even paid the entry fee". Such statements conflicted with the findings of the parliamentary inquiry commission appointed to investigate the lodge's activity, with material evidence, and even with previous testimony of Berlusconi, all of which proved that he had actually been a member of P2 since 1978 and had indeed paid 100,000 Italian liras (approximately equivalent to 300 euros today) as an entry fee. In 1990 the court of appeal of Venice found Berlusconi guilty of false testimony in front of the Court of Verona, however the court could not pass sentence as the offense had been pardoned by an amnesty passed in 1989.[117]Some political commentators claim that Berlusconi's electoral programme followed the P2 plan.[118]David Mills, lawyer husband of the former British cabinet minister Tessa Jowell, acted for Berlusconi in the early 1990s, and was later accused by Italian prosecutors of money laundering and of accepting a gift from Berlusconi in return for witness evidence favourable to Berlusconi given in court. Mills claimed that the money in question came not from Berlusconi but from another client. Tessa Jowell then announced her separation from Mills, which some of the UK media suggested was an attempt to distance herself from a potential scandal. She also denied having discussed the money with her husband; Private Eye magazine published a satirical front cover of Jowell with a speech bubble stating: "I have never met my husband". In December 2010, information obtained by the Wikileaks website revealed Mr Berlusconi had become very fond of Ms Jowell, referring to her in private company as 'piccolo puntaspilli' (the little pincushion).[citation needed]On 17 February 2009, Mills was found guilty of accepting a bribe of about 400,000 pounds sterling, allegedly from Silvio Berlusconi, and was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison.[119] On 25 February 2010, the Court of Cassation gave a verdict of not guilty because the statute of limitations expired.[120][121] The supreme court judges ruled that he received the money in 1999, and not 2000 as prosecutors had previously argued. He was ordered to pay 250,000 compensation to the office of the Italian prime minister for "damaging its reputation".[122]In February 2011, Berlusconi was charged with paying for sex with nightclub dancer Karima El Mahroug between February and May 2010 when she was under the age of 18.[123][124] He was also charged with abusing his political powers in an attempt to cover up the relationship (by trying to persuade the police to release the girl while she was under arrest for theft, based on a false claim that she was the granddaughter of Hosni Mubarak).[123]In February 2012, Milan prosecutors brought charges against Berlusconi for alleged abuse of office connected with the publication of confidential wiretaps by the Italian newspaper Il Giornale, which is owned by Berlusconi's brother, in 2005.[125][126] The publication of the conversations between then Governor of the Bank of Italy Antonio Fazio, senior management of Unipol and Italian centre-left politician Piero Fassino was a breach of secrecy rules and was seen at the time as an attempt to discredit Berlusconi's political rivals. Their publication also eventually led to the collapse of the proposed takeover of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro by Unipol and the resignation of Fazio.[125] The head of the company used by Italian prosecutors to record the conversations has been previously convicted of stealing the recordings and making them available to Berlusconi.[126] On 7 February 2012, at an initial court hearing, Berlusconi denied he had listened to the tapes and ordered their publication.[126]On October 26, 2012, Berlusconi was sentenced to four years in prison by an Italian court for tax evasion. [127][7] Although the term was longer than the three years and eight months the prosecutors had requested, it was shortened to one year in accord with a 2006 amnesty law.[8] The charges were in relation to a scheme to purchase overseas film rights at inflated prices through offshore companies.[8] He and his co-defendants have been ordered to pay 10 million Euros and have been banned from holding public office for three years.[8] He remains free and is expected to appeal the decision.[8]According to journalists Marco Travaglio and Enzo Biagi, Berlusconi entered politics to save his companies from bankruptcy and himself from convictions.[128] From the very beginning he said it clearly to his associates. Berlusconi's supporters hailed him as the "novus homo", an outsider who was going to bring a new efficiency to the public bureaucracy and reform the state from top to bottom.Berlusconi was investigated for forty different inquests in less than two years.[129]Berlusconi's governments passed laws that shortened statutory terms for tax fraud. Romano Prodi, who defeated Berlusconi in 2006, claimed that these were ad personam laws, meant to solve Berlusconi's problems and defend his interests.[130][131][132][133]Berlusconi's extensive control over the media has been widely criticised by some analysts,[134] some press freedom organisations, and extensively on several Italian newspapers, national and private TV channels by opposition leaders and in general opposition parties members, who allege Italy's media has limited freedom of expression. However such covereage of the complaint in practice put under discussion the point of the complaint itself. The Freedom of the Press 2004 Global Survey, an annual study issued by the American organisation Freedom House, downgraded Italy's ranking from 'Free' to 'Partly Free'[135] due to Berlusconi's influence over RAI, a ranking which, in "Western Europe" was shared only with Turkey (as of 2005[update]). Reporters Without Borders states that in 2004, "The conflict of interests involving prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his vast media empire was still not resolved and continued to threaten news diversity".[136] In April 2004, the International Federation of Journalists joined the criticism, objecting to the passage of a law vetoed by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in 2003, which critics believe is designed to protect Berlusconi's reported 90% control of the Italian national media.[137]Berlusconi owns via Mediaset 3 of 7 national TV channels: (Canale 5, Italia 1, and Rete 4). To better understand the controversies over a conflict of interest between Berlusconi's personal business empire and his political office, it is necessary to look at the structure of governmental control over State television.[according to whom?] Under the law, the Speakers of the two Houses appoint the RAI president and board of directors. In practice, the decision is a political one, generally resulting in some opposition representatives becoming directors, while top managerial posts go to people sympathetic to the government. It was normal to have two directors and the president belonging to the parliamentary majority, and two directors who are opposition supporters. A parliamentary supervisory commission also exists, whose president is traditionally a member of the opposition. During the tenure of Mr. Baldassarre as RAI president, the two opposition directors and the one closer to the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats left over internal disagreements that mainly regarded censorship issues. RAI continued to be run by a two-man team (mockingly nicknamed by the opposition the Japanese after the Japanese soldiers who kept fighting on in the Pacific Ocean after the end of World War II).[citation needed]The former Italian center-left coalition of Romano Prodi was often criticised for failing to pass a law to regulate the potential conflict of interest that might arise between media ownership and the holding of political office, despite having governed Italy for an entire legislature from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, Luciano Violante, a prominent member of the Left, said in a speech in Parliament: "Honourable Anedda, I invite you to ask the honourable Berlusconi, because he certainly knows that he received a full guarantee in 1994, when the government changed that TV stations would not be touched. He knows it and the Honourable Letta knows it."[138][verification needed]The authors of the book Inciucio[139] cite this sentence as evidence for the idea that the Left made a deal with Berlusconi in 1994, in which a promise was made not to honour a law in the Constitutional Court of Italy that would have required Berlusconi to give up one of his three TV channels in order to uphold pluralism and competition. According to the authors, this would be an explanation of why the Left, despite having won the 1996 elections, did not pass a law to solve the conflicts of interest between media ownership and politics.Berlusconi's influence over RAI became evident when in Sofia, Bulgaria he expressed his views on journalists Enzo Biagi and Michele Santoro,[140] and comedian Daniele Luttazzi. Berlusconi said that they "use television as a criminal means of communication". They lost their jobs as a result.[141] This statement was called by critics "Editto Bulgaro".The TV broadcasting of a satirical programmme called RAIot was censored in November 2003 after the comedienne Sabina Guzzanti made outspoken criticism of the Berlusconi media empire.[142] Mediaset, one of Berlusconi's companies, sued RAI over Guzzanti's program, demanding 20million euros for "damages"; in November 2003 the show was cancelled by the president of RAI, Lucia Annunziata. The details of the event were made into a Michael Moore-style documentary called Viva Zapatero!, which was produced by Guzzanti.Mediaset, Berlusconi's television group, has stated that it uses the same criteria as the public (state-owned) television RAI in assigning a proper visibility to all the most important political parties and movements (the so-called 'Par Condicio') which has been since often disproved.[143][144] In March 2006, on the television channel Rai Tre, in a television interview with Lucia Annunziata during his talk show, In 1/2 h, he stormed out of the studio because of a disagreement with the host journalist regarding the economic consequences of his government.[145] In November 2007, allegations of news manipulation caused the departure from RAI of Berlusconi's personal assistant.[146]Enrico Mentana, the news anchor long seen as a guarantor of Canale 5's independence, walked out in April 2008, saying that he no longer felt "at home in a group that seems like an electoral [campaign] committee".[147]On 24 June 2009, Silvio Berlusconi during the Confindustria young members congress in Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy has invited the advertisers to interrupt or boycott the advertising contracts with the magazines and newspapers published by Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso,[148] in particular the la Repubblica and the newsmagazine L'espresso, calling the publishing group "shameless",[148] because is fueling the economic crisis speaking more and more about it and accusing also to make a subversive attack against him to replace with an "un-elected".[149] The publishing group has announced to begin legal proceedings against Berlusconi, to protect the image and the interests of the group.[149]On 12 October 2009, Silvio Berlusconi during the Confindustria Monza and Brianza members congress, has again invited the industrialists present to a "widespread rebellion" against a "newspaper that hadn't any limits in discrediting the government and the country and indoctrinating foreign newspapers".[150]In October 2009, Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Jean-Franois Julliard declared that Berlusconi "is on the verge of being added to our list of Predators of Press Freedom", which would be a first for a European leader. He also added that Italy will probably be ranked last in the European Union in the upcoming edition of the RWB press freedom index.[151]One of Berlusconi's strongest critics in the media outside Italy is the British weekly The Economist (nicknamed by Berlusconi "The Ecommunist"), which in its issue of 26 April 2001 carried a title on its front cover, 'Why Silvio Berlusconi is unfit to lead Italy'.[152] The war of words between Berlusconi and The Economist has gained notoriety, with Berlusconi taking the publication to court in Rome and The Economist publishing letters against him.[153] The magazine claimed that the documentation contained in its article proves that Berlusconi is 'unfit' for office[154] because of his numerous conflicts of interest. Berlusconi claimed the article contained "a series of old accusations" that was an "insult to truth and intelligence".According to The Economist's findings, Berlusconi, while Prime Minister of Italy, retained effective control of 90% of all national television broadcasting. This figure included stations he owns directly as well as those over which he had indirect control by dint of his position as Prime Minister and his ability to influence the choice of the management bodies of these stations. The Economist has also claimed that the Italian Prime Minister is corrupt and self-serving. A key journalist for The Economist, David Lane, has set out many of these charges in his book Berlusconi's Shadow.[155]Lane points out that Berlusconi has not defended himself in court against the main charges, but has relied upon political and legal manipulations, most notably by changing the statute of limitation to prevent charges being completed in the first place. In order to publicly prove the truth of the documented accusations contained in their articles, the newspaper has publicly challenged Berlusconi to sue The Economist for libel. Berlusconi did so,[156] losing versus The Economist, and being charged for all the trial costs on 5 September 2008, when the Court in Milan issued a judgment rejecting all Mr Berlusconi's claims and sentenced him to compensate for legal expenses.In June 2011, The Economist published a strong article dealing with Mr. Berlusconi, titled "The Man who screwed an entire country".[157]On some occasions, which raised a strong upheaval in the Italian political opposition, laws passed by the Berlusconi administration have effectively delayed ongoing trials on him. Relevant examples are the law reducing punishment for all cases of false accounting and the law on legitimate suspicion, which allowed defendants to request their cases to be moved to another court if they believe that the local judges are biased against them.7, 8 Because of these legislative actions, political opponents accuse Berlusconi of passing these laws for the purpose of protecting himself from legal charges. An enquiry realised by the newspaper La Repubblica sustained that Berlusconi passed 17 different laws which have advantaged himself;[158] Berlusconi and his allies, on the other hand, maintain that such laws are consistent with everyone's right to a rapid and just trial, and with the principle of presumption of innocence (garantismo); furthermore, they claim that Berlusconi is being subjected to a political "witch hunt", orchestrated by certain (allegedly left-wing) judges11.For such reasons, Berlusconi and his government have an ongoing quarrel with the Italian judiciary, which reached its peak in 2003 when Berlusconi commented to a foreign journalist that judges are "mentally disturbed" and "anthropologically different from the rest of the human race", remarks that he later claimed he meant to be directed to specific judges only, and of a humorous nature12. More seriously, the Berlusconi administration has long been planning a judiciary reform intended to limit the flexibility currently enjoyed by judges and magistrates in their decision-making, but which, according to its critics, will instead limit the magistrature's independence, by de facto subjecting the judiciary to the executive's control. This reform has met almost unanimous dissent from the Italian judges13, 14 and, after three years of debate and struggle, was passed by the Italian parliament in December 2004, but was immediately vetoed by the Italian President, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi 15, because of the unconstitutionality of some of the passed laws.Berlusconi has also been indicted in Spain for charges of tax fraud and violation of anti-trust laws regarding the private television network Telecinco, but his status as a member of the European Parliament allowed him to gain immunity from prosecution until 2005.16 All the accused have been acquitted by the Spanish Supreme Court in July 2008.[159][160]During the night hours between 5 and 6 March 2010, the Berlusconi-led Italian government passed a decree interpreting the electoral law so as to let the PDL candidate run for governor in Lazio after she had failed to properly register for the elections. The Italian Constitution states that electoral procedures can only be changed in Parliament, and must not be changed by governmental decree. Italy's President, whose endorsement of the decree was required by law, said amid much controversy that the measure taken by the government may not violate the Constitution.[161][162]Mafia boss Giuseppe Guttadauro in a wiretapped conversation.[163]Silvio Berlusconi has never been tried on charges relating to Cosa Nostra, although several Mafia turncoats have stated that Berlusconi had connections with the Sicilian criminal association. The claims arise mostly from the hiring of Vittorio Mangano, charged for Mafia association, as a gardener and stable-man at Berlusconi's Villa San Martino in Arcore, a small town near Milan. It was Berlusconi's friend Marcello Dell'Utri who introduced Mangano to Berlusconi in 1973.[164][165] Berlusconi denied any ties to the Mafia. Marcello Dell'Utri even stated that the Mafia did not exist at all.In 2004 Dell'Utri, co-founder of Forza Italia, was sentenced to nine years by a Palermo court on charge of "external association to the Mafia",[165][166] a sentence describing Dell'Utri as a mediator between the economical interests of Berlusconi and members of the criminal organisation. Berlusconi refused to comment on the sentence. In 2010, Palermo's appeals court cut the sentence to seven years but fully confirmed Dell'Utri's role as a link between Berlusconi and the mafia until 1992.[167]In 1996, a Mafia informer, Salvatore Cancemi, declared that Berlusconi and Dell'Utri were in direct contact with Salvatore Riina, head of the Sicilian Mafia in the 1980s and 1990s. Cancemi disclosed that Fininvest, through Marcello Dell'Utri and mafioso Vittorio Mangano, had paid Cosa Nostra 200million lire (between 100,000 and 200,000 of today's euro) annually. The alleged contacts, according to Cancemi, were to lead to legislation favourable to Cosa Nostra, in particular the harsh 41-bis prison regime. The underlying premise was that Cosa Nostra would support Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in return for political favours.[168] After a two-year investigation, magistrates closed the inquiry without charges. They did not find evidence to corroborate Cancemi's allegations. Similarly, a two-year investigation, also launched on evidence from Cancemi, into Berlusconi's alleged association with the Mafia was closed in 1996.[164]According to yet another mafia turncoat, Antonino Giuffr arrested on 16 April 2002 the Mafia turned to Berlusconi's Forza Italia party to look after the Mafia's interests, after the decline in the early 1990s of the ruling Christian Democrat party, whose leaders in Sicily looked after the Mafia's interests in Rome. The Mafia's fall out with the Christian Democrats became clear when Salvo Lima was killed in March 1992. "The Lima murder marked the end of an era," Giuffr told the court. "A new era opened with a new political force on the horizon which provided the guarantees that the Christian Democrats were no longer able to deliver. To be clear, that party was Forza Italia."[169] Dell'Utri was the go-between on a range of legislative efforts to ease pressure on mafiosi in exchange for electoral support, according to Giuffr. "Dell'Utri was very close to Cosa Nostra and a very good contact point for Berlusconi," he said.[170] Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano told Giuffr that they "were in good hands" with Dell'Utri, who was a "serious and trustworthy person". Provenzano stated that the Mafia's judicial problems would be resolved within 10 years after 1992, thanks to the undertakings given by Forza Italia.[165][169]Giuffr also said that Berlusconi himself used to be in touch with Stefano Bontade, a top Mafia boss, in the mid 1970s. At the time Berlusconi still was just a wealthy real estate developer and started his private television empire. Bontade visited Berlusconi's villa in Arcore through his contact Vittorio Mangano.[171] Berlusconi's lawyer dismissed Giuffr's testimony as "false" and an attempt to discredit the Prime Minister and his party. Giuffr said that other Mafia representatives who were in contact with Berlusconi included the Palermo Mafia bosses Filippo Graviano and Giuseppe Graviano.[172] The Graviano brothers allegedly treated directly with Berlusconi through the business-man Gianni Letta, somewhere between September/October 1993. The alleged pact with the Mafia fell apart in 2002. Cosa Nostra had achieved nothing.[173]Dell'Utri's lawyer, Enrico Trantino, dismissed Giuffr's allegations as an "anthology of hearsay". He said Giuffr had perpetuated the trend that every new turncoat would attack Dell'Utri and the former Christian Democrat prime minister Giulio Andreotti in order to earn money and judicial privileges.[171]In October 2009, Gaspare Spatuzza, a Mafioso turned pentito in 2008, has confirmed Giuffr statements. Spatuzza testified that his boss Giuseppe Graviano had told him in 1994 that Berlusconi was bargaining with the Mafia, concerning a political-electoral agreement between Cosa Nostra and Berlusconi's Forza Italia. Spatuzza said Graviano disclosed the information to him during a conversation in a bar Graviano owned in the upscale Via Veneto district of the Italian capital Rome. Dell'Utri was the intermediary, according to Spatuzza. Dell'Utri has dismissed Spatuzza's allegations as "nonsense". Berlusconi's lawyer and MP for the PdL, Niccol Ghedini said that "the statements given by Spatuzza about prime minister Berlusconi are baseless and can be in no way verified."[174]After the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York, Berlusconi said: "We must be aware of the superiority of our civilisation, a system that has guaranteed well-being, respect for human rights and in contrast with Islamic countries respect for religious and political rights, a system that has as its value understanding of diversity and tolerance."[175][176] This declaration caused an uproar, not only in the Arab and Muslim world, but also all around Europe, including Italy.[177] Subsequently Berlusconi told the press: "We are aware of the crucial role of moderate Arab countries... I am sorry that words that have been misunderstood have offended the sensitivity of my Arab and Muslim friends."[178]Berlusconi has developed a reputation for making gaffes or insensitive remarks.[179]On 2 July 2003, Berlusconi suggested that German SPD MEP Martin Schulz, who had criticised his domestic policies, should play a Nazi concentration camp guard in a film.[180] Berlusconi insisted that he was joking, but accused Schulz and others to be "bad-willing tourists of democracy". This incident caused a brief cooling of Italy's relationship with Germany.[181]Addressing traders at the New York Stock Exchange in September 2003, Berlusconi listed a series of reasons to invest in Italy, the first of which was that "we have the most beautiful secretaries in the world". This remark resulted in uproar in Italy where female members of parliament took part in a one-day cross-party protest.[182] Berlusconi's list also included the claim that Italy had "fewer communists, and those who are still here deny having been one".[183]In 2003, during an interview with Nicholas Farrell, then editor of The Spectator, Berlusconi claimed that Mussolini "had been a benign dictator who did not murder opponents but sent them 'on holiday'".[184]Berlusconi had made disparaging remarks about Finnish cuisine during negotiations to decide on the location of the European Food Safety Authority in 2001. He caused further offence in 2005, when he claimed that during the negotiations he had had to "dust off his playboy charms" in order to persuade the Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, to concede that the EFSA should be based in Parma instead of Finland, and compared Finnish smoked reindeer unfavourably to culatello. The Italian ambassador in Helsinki was summoned by the Finnish foreign minister.[185] One of Berlusconi's ministers later 'explained' the comment by saying that "anyone who had seen a picture of Halonen must have been aware that he had been joking". Halonen took the incident in good humour, retorting that Berlusconi had "overestimated his persuasion skills".[186] The Finnish pizza chain Kotipizza responded by launching a variety of pizza called Pizza Berlusconi, using smoked reindeer as the topping. The pizza won first prize in America's Plate International pizza contest in March 2008.[187][188]In March 2006, Berlusconi alleged that Chinese communists under Mao Zedong had "boiled [children] to fertilise the fields". His opponent Romano Prodi criticised Berlusconi for offending the Chinese people and called his comments 'unthinkable'.[189] Berlusconi replied by gifting 1000 copies of The Black Book of Communism during one of his election rallies.[citation needed]In the run-up to the 2008 Italian general election, Berlusconi was angrily accused of sexism for saying that female politicians from the right were "more beautiful" and that "the left has no taste, even when it comes to women".[190] In 2008 Berlusconi criticised the composition of the Council of Ministers of the Spanish Government as being too 'pink' by virtue of the fact that it has (once the President of the Council, Jos Luis Rodrguez Zapatero, is counted) an equal number of men and women. He also stated that he doubted that such a composition would be possible in Italy given the "prevalence of men" in Italian politics.[191]Also in 2008 Berlusconi caused controversy at a joint press conference with Russian president Vladimir Putin. When a journalist from the Russian paper Nezavisimaya Gazeta asked a question about Mr Putin's personal relationships, Berlusconi made a gesture towards the journalist imitating a gunman shooting.[192][193]On 6 November 2008, two days after Barack Obama was elected the first black US President, Berlusconi referred to Obama as "young, handsome and even tanned":[194][195][196] On 26 March 2009 he said "I'm paler [than Mr Obama], because it's been so long since I went sunbathing. He's more handsome, younger and taller."[197]Subsequently, at a tent camp on the outskirts of L'Aquila housing some of the more than 30,000 people who lost their homes during the 2009 earthquake he said to an African priest: "you have a nice tan."[198]On 24 January 2009, Berlusconi announced his aim to increase the numbers of military patrolling the Italian cities from 3,000 to 30,000 in order to crack down on what he called an "evil army" of criminals. Responding to a female journalist who asked him if this tenfold increase in patrolling soldiers would be enough to secure Italian women from being raped, he said: "We could not field a big enough force to avoid this risk [of rape]. We would need as many soldiers as beautiful women and I don't think that would be possible, because our women are so beautiful." Opposition leaders called the remarks insensitive and in bad taste. Berlusconi retorted that he had merely wanted to compliment Italian women. Other critics accused him of creating a "police state".[199]On 3 April 2009, Berlusconi appeared to have annoyed Queen Elizabeth II at a photo session during the G20 summit. During the photo session, Berlusconi shouted "Mr. Obama, Mr. Obama", prompting her to turn around and chastise Berlusconi, "What is it? Why does he have to shout?".[200][201] The following day, at the NATO meeting in Kehl, Berlusconi was seen talking on his mobile phone, while Merkel and other NATO leaders waited for him for a photo on a Rhine bridge.[202] (Afterwards, Berlusconi claimed he was talking to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoan about accepting the Secretary Generalship of Anders Fogh Rasmussen). Responding to the Italian media's reaction to these incidents, he said he was considering "hard measures" against reporters, and referred to some of their claims as "slander".[203]Two days after the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, Berlusconi suggested that people left homeless should view their experience as a camping weekend.[204] While touring the earthquake site, he asked councillor Lia Beltrami, "Can I fondle you?".[205]In May 2009, Berlusconi alleged that he had once had to travel three hours to see a two hundred year old church in the Finnish countryside which, in his opinion, would have been demolished if it was in Italy. Berlusconi had made a non-official visit to Finland in 1999 and had never seen any Finnish church, but had just been visiting Iceland.[206][207]In October 2010, Berlusconi was chastised by the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano after he was filmed telling "offensive and deplorable jokes", including one whose punchline was similar to one of the gravest blasphemies in the Italian language. It was also revealed he had made another antisemitic joke a few days previously. Berlusconi responded to the allegations by saying the jokes were "neither an offence nor a sin, but merely a laugh".[208]On 1 November 2010, after once again being accused of involvement in juvenile prostitution, he suggested that an audience at the Milan trade fair should stop reading newspapers: "Don't read newspapers any more because they deceive you. [...] I am a man who works hard all day long and if sometimes I look at some good-looking girl, it's better to be fond of pretty girls than to be gay".[209]The remarks were immediately condemned by Arcigay, Italy's main gay rights organisation, on behalf of both women and gay people; speaking on behalf of the organisation, its president Paolo Patan said that it was "unacceptable for a head of government to foster a chauvinistic and vulgar attitude" with such a statement, and requested that Berlusconi apologise. Politicians including Nichi Vendola, Antonio Di Pietro, and Franco Grillini released similar statements, with the latter commenting that it was "better to be gay than to be a sex-addicted schemer like Berlusconi."[210][211] Flavia Madaschi, president of Agedo, the Italian equivalent of PFLAG, also commented that it was "better to be gay than Berlusconi."[212] Activists staged an anti-homophobia protest outside Palazzo Chigi.[213]On 13 July 2011, according to a leaked telephone surveillance transcript, Berlusconi told his presumed blackmailer Valter Lavitola: "The only thing they can say about me is that I screw around [...] Now they're spying on me, controlling my phone calls. I don't give a fuck. In a few months [...] I'll be leaving this shit country that makes me sick."[214] He had already made a comment about sending a postcard from the Bahamas in 2005.[215]Berlusconi's career as an entrepreneur is also often questioned by his detractors. The allegations made against him generally include suspicions about the extremely fast increase of his activity as a construction entrepreneur in years 196163, hinting at the possibility that in those years he received money from unknown and possibly illegal sources. These accusations are regarded by Berlusconi and his supporters as empty slander, trying to undermine Berlusconi's reputation as a self-made man. Also frequently cited by opponents are events dating to the 1980s, including supposed "favour exchanges" between Berlusconi and Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist prime minister and leader of the Italian Socialist Party convicted in 1994 for various corruption charges. The Milan magistrates who indicted and successfully convicted Mr. Craxi in their "Clean Hands" investigation laid bare an entrenched system in which businessmen paid hundreds of millions of dollars to political parties or individual politicians in exchange for sweetheart deals with Italian state companies and the government itself.[216] Berlusconi acknowledges a personal friendship with Craxi.On 13 December 2009 Berlusconi was hit in the face with an alabaster[217] statuette of Milan Cathedral after a rally in Milan's Piazza del Duomo. As Berlusconi was shaking hands with the public, a man in the crowd stepped forward and launched the statuette at him. The assailant was subsequently detained and identified as Massimo Tartaglia, a 42 year-old surveyor with a history of mental illness but no criminal record, living in the outskirts of Milan.[218][219] According to a letter released to the Italian news agency ANSA, Tartaglia has apologised for the attack, writing: "I don't recognise myself", and adding that he had "acted alone [with no] form of militancy or political affiliation". Berlusconi suffered facial injuries, a broken nose and two broken teeth; he was subsequently hospitalised.[220] Italian president Giorgio Napolitano and politicians from all parties in Italy condemned the attack.In the night of 1516 December a 26-year old man was stopped by police and Berlusconi's bodyguards while trying to gain access to Berlusconi's hospital room. A search revealed that he carried no weapons, although three hockey sticks and two knives were later found in his car. The suspect was known to have a history of mental illness and mandatory treatment in mental institutions.[221]Berlusconi was discharged from the hospital on 17 December 2009.[222]1 Family background and personal life

TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) is a global set of conferences owned by the private non-profit Sapling Foundation, formed to disseminate "ideas worth spreading."TED was founded in 1984 as a one-off event.[1] The annual conference began in 1990, in Monterey, California.[4] TED's early emphasis was technology and design, consistent with its origins in the Silicon Valley. The events are now held in Long Beach and Palm Springs in the U.S. and in Europe and Asia, offering live streaming of the talks. They address a wide range of topics within the research and practice of science and culture, often through storytelling.[5] The speakers are given a maximum of 18 minutes to present their ideas in the most innovative and engaging ways they can. Past presenters include Bill Clinton, Jane Goodall, Malcolm Gladwell, Al Gore, Gordon Brown, Richard Dawkins, Bill Gates, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and many Nobel Prize winners.[6] TED's current curator is the British former computer journalist and magazine publisher Chris Anderson.From 2005 to 2009, three $100,000 TED Prizes were awarded annually to help its winners realize a chosen wish to change the world. From 2010, in a changed selection process, a single winner is chosen to ensure that TED can maximize its efforts in achieving the winner's wish. Each winner unveils their wish at the main annual conference. Starting in 2013, the prize money will be raised to 1 million dollars.[7]Since June 2006,[1] the talks have been offered for free viewing online, under Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs Creative Commons license, through TED.com.[8] As of November 2011, over 1,050 talks are available free online.[9] By January 2009 they had been viewed 50 million times. In June 2011, the viewing figure stood at more than 500 million,[10] and on Tuesday November 13th 2012, TED Talks had been watched one billion times worldwide, reflecting a still growing global audience.[11]TED's mission statement begins:We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and ultimately, the world. So we're building here a clearinghouse that offers free knowledge and inspiration from the world's most inspired thinkers, and also a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other.[12]The TED staff is headquartered in New York City and Vancouver. The conference was held in Monterey, California until 2009. It was then relocated to Long Beach, California due to a substantial increase of attendees.[13]TED was founded by architect and graphic designer Richard Saul Wurman and Harry Marks in 1984, and has been held annually since 1990. Wurman, credited with having coined the term information architect in 1979, left after the 2002 conference; the event is now hosted by Chris Anderson and owned by his non-profit organization, The Sapling Foundation,[2] devoted to "fostering the spread of great ideas." In 2006, attendance cost was $4,400 and was by invitation only.[14] The membership model was shifted in January 2007 to an annual membership fee of $6,000, which includes attendance of the conference, club mailings, networking tools and conference DVDs.Since June 2006, TED Talks have been made available online on the websites of TED, YouTube, and iTunes,[15][16][17] and since late 2009, there have been free apps for iOS (iPhone, iPad), Android, webOS and Windows Phone 7.[18] In 2009, the TED website won the award for Best Use of Video or Moving Image at the 13th Annual Webby Awards.[19]In 2012, TED Talks became available to stream through Netflix.[20] TED.com won a Peabody Award in April 2012. [21]TED 2011, The Rediscovery of Wonder, was held in Long Beach, California, from February 28 to March 4, 2011.[22][23] The TED conference has a companion conference, TEDGlobal, held in the UK each summer. The 2009 TEDGlobal, The Substance of Things Not Seen, was held in Oxford, UK, July 2124, 2009. 2010's TEDGlobal (again in Oxford) was themed And Now The Good News; in 2011 the conference moved to a new home in Edinburgh and was held from July 1215 with the theme The Stuff Of Life. The 2012 TEDGlobal conference Radical Openness was held in Edinburgh from June 25-29.[24]The TED Prize was introduced in 2005. It initially granted three individuals $100,000 and a "wish to change the world". [25] Since 2010, however, only one prize has been awarded since "at least half of [the wishes] still require our engagement," and, "adding too many more risks dilution of effort." For 2013, the prize amount has been increased to $1 million.[26]TED Open Translation Project started in May 2009, and aims to "[reach] out to the 4.5 billion people on the planet who don't speak English," according to TED Curator Chris Anderson.[35] The OTP utilises crowd-based video captioning and subtitling platforms to translate the text of TED videos (with its technology partner dotSUB until May 2012, and recently with open source translation tool Amara). At the time of the launch, 300 translations had been done by 200 volunteer transcribers in 40 languages.[22] In December 2012, a total of 8377 volunteer translators had completed 32.684 translations in 93 languages. (Not all of those translators are still active)The project contributed to a significant increase in international visitors to TED's website, with traffic from outside the US growing 350%, 600% percent growth in Asia, and more than 1000% in South America.[36]In 2009 TED started granting licenses to third parties to organize independent TED-like events internationally.[37] At these TEDx events are prohibited from making profit, although sometimes a fee ($100 max.) can be charged to cover running costs. The licences are free but franchisees are vetted by TED and events are subject to conditions. Speakers are not paid and they must agree to give TED the right to edit and distribute their presentation under a Creative Commons licence. As of 2012, more than 16,000 talks have been given at more than 4,254 TEDx events in 1,200 cities in 133 countries.[38][39] In June 2012, five TEDx events on average were being organized in 133 countries, every day.[40]TED drew some controversy in 2010 when comedian Sarah Silverman was invited to speak at the conference, and in response to her speech about adopting a "retarded" child, TED organizer Chris Anderson posted to his Twitter account, "I know I shouldnt say this about one of my own speakers, but I thought Sarah Silverman was god-awful ..."[44] Anderson later deleted his tweet, but Silverman responded via her Twitter account "Kudos to [Chris Anderson] for making TED an unsafe haven for all! You're a barnacle of mediocrity on Bill Gates' asshole."[45] Anderson apologized for his tweet on his Posterous account, but also wrote "Call me stuffy, but I still think humor about terminally ill 'retarded' kids is an acquired taste ... And not a taste I personally want to acquire."[46]Nassim Taleb accused TED of intellectual dishonesty and lack of substance in the latest edition of The Black Swan (2010). He calls TED a "monstrosity that turns scientists and thinkers into low-level entertainers, like circus performers." Taleb spoke at TED2008. He claimed that the curators did not initially post his talk "warning about the financial crisis" on their website on purely cosmetic grounds.[47]Sarah Lacy of BusinessWeek and TechCrunch has criticized TED with claims of elitism. Lacy cites TED's $6,000 ticket price, poor treatment of less important attendees, and such events as a friend being "de-invited to TED after quitting an ostensibly prestigious San Francisco job" as evidence of her claims.[48] Independent blogger Robert Scoble described her stance as motivated by jealousy. [49] Lacy did credit TED for moving the event to a larger venue in Long Beach and posting videos of its talks online for free.[48]TED attracted controversy when it chose not to link venture capitalist Nick Hanauer's speech at TED university on their website. The speech analysed the top rate of tax versus unemployment and economic equality.[50][51][52] In a private email to Hanauer, Chris Anderson commented on his decision, noting: "Nick, I personally share your disgust at the growth in inequality in the US, and would love to have found a way to give people a clearer mindset on the issue, without stoking a tedious partisan rehash of all the arguments we hear every day in the mainstream media. Alas, my judgement is that publishing your talk would not meet that goal."[53] Anderson later pointed out that TED only posts one talk every day, selected from many.[54] Forbes Staff writer Bruce Upbin described Hanauer's talk as "shoddy and dumb".[55]1 Background2 TED Prize3 Open Translation Program4 TEDx5 Other programs6 Controversies and criticism7 See also8 References9 External linksThe TED fellowship program.

TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) is a global set of conferences owned by the private non-profit Sapling Foundation, formed to disseminate "ideas worth spreading."TED was founded in 1984 as a one-off event.[1] The annual conference began in 1990, in Monterey, California.[4] TED's early emphasis was technology and design, consistent with its origins in the Silicon Valley. The events are now held in Long Beach and Palm Springs in the U.S. and in Europe and Asia, offering live streaming of the talks. They address a wide range of topics within the research and practice of science and culture, often through storytelling.[5] The speakers are given a maximum of 18 minutes to present their ideas in the most innovative and engaging ways they can. Past presenters include Bill Clinton, Jane Goodall, Malcolm Gladwell, Al Gore, Gordon Brown, Richard Dawkins, Bill Gates, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and many Nobel Prize winners.[6] TED's current curator is the British former computer journalist and magazine publisher Chris Anderson.From 2005 to 2009, three $100,000 TED Prizes were awarded annually to help its winners realize a chosen wish to change the world. From 2010, in a changed selection process, a single winner is chosen to ensure that TED can maximize its efforts in achieving the winner's wish. Each winner unveils their wish at the main annual conference. Starting in 2013, the prize money will be raised to 1 million dollars.[7]Since June 2006,[1] the talks have been offered for free viewing online, under Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs Creative Commons license, through TED.com.[8] As of November 2011, over 1,050 talks are available free online.[9] By January 2009 they had been viewed 50 million times. In June 2011, the viewing figure stood at more than 500 million,[10] and on Tuesday November 13th 2012, TED Talks had been watched one billion times worldwide, reflecting a still growing global audience.[11]TED's mission statement begins:We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and ultimately, the world. So we're building here a clearinghouse that offers free knowledge and inspiration from the world's most inspired thinkers, and also a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other.[12]The TED staff is headquartered in New York City and Vancouver. The conference was held in Monterey, California until 2009. It was then relocated to Long Beach, California due to a substantial increase of attendees.[13]TED was founded by architect and graphic designer Richard Saul Wurman and Harry Marks in 1984, and has been held annually since 1990. Wurman, credited with having coined the term information architect in 1979, left after the 2002 conference; the event is now hosted by Chris Anderson and owned by his non-profit organization, The Sapling Foundation,[2] devoted to "fostering the spread of great ideas." In 2006, attendance cost was $4,400 and was by invitation only.[14] The membership model was shifted in January 2007 to an annual membership fee of $6,000, which includes attendance of the conference, club mailings, networking tools and conference DVDs.Since June 2006, TED Talks have been made available online on the websites of TED, YouTube, and iTunes,[15][16][17] and since late 2009, there have been free apps for iOS (iPhone, iPad), Android, webOS and Windows Phone 7.[18] In 2009, the TED website won the award for Best Use of Video or Moving Image at the 13th Annual Webby Awards.[19]In 2012, TED Talks became available to stream through Netflix.[20] TED.com won a Peabody Award in April 2012. [21]TED 2011, The Rediscovery of Wonder, was held in Long Beach, California, from February 28 to March 4, 2011.[22][23] The TED conference has a companion conference, TEDGlobal, held in the UK each summer. The 2009 TEDGlobal, The Substance of Things Not Seen, was held in Oxford, UK, July 2124, 2009. 2010's TEDGlobal (again in Oxford) was themed And Now The Good News; in 2011 the conference moved to a new home in Edinburgh and was held from July 1215 with the theme The Stuff Of Life. The 2012 TEDGlobal conference Radical Openness was held in Edinburgh from June 25-29.[24]The TED Prize was introduced in 2005. It initially granted three individuals $100,000 and a "wish to change the world". [25] Since 2010, however, only one prize has been awarded since "at least half of [the wishes] still require our engagement," and, "adding too many more risks dilution of effort." For 2013, the prize amount has been increased to $1 million.[26]TED Open Translation Project started in May 2009, and aims to "[reach] out to the 4.5 billion people on the planet who don't speak English," according to TED Curator Chris Anderson.[35] The OTP utilises crowd-based video captioning and subtitling platforms to translate the text of TED videos (with its technology partner dotSUB until May 2012, and recently with open source translation tool Amara). At the time of the launch, 300 translations had been done by 200 volunteer transcribers in 40 languages.[22] In December 2012, a total of 8377 volunteer translators had completed 32.684 translations in 93 languages. (Not all of those translators are still active)The project contributed to a significant increase in international visitors to TED's website, with traffic from outside the US growing 350%, 600% percent growth in Asia, and more than 1000% in South America.[36]In 2009 TED started granting licenses to third parties to organize independent TED-like events internationally.[37] At these TEDx events are prohibited from making profit, although sometimes a fee ($100 max.) can be charged to cover running costs. The licences are free but franchisees are vetted by TED and events are subject to conditions. Speakers are not paid and they must agree to give TED the right to edit and distribute their presentation under a Creative Commons licence. As of 2012, more than 16,000 talks have been given at more than 4,254 TEDx events in 1,200 cities in 133 countries.[38][39] In June 2012, five TEDx events on average were being organized in 133 countries, every day.[40]TED drew some controversy in 2010 when comedian Sarah Silverman was invited to speak at the conference, and in response to her speech about adopting a "retarded" child, TED organizer Chris Anderson posted to his Twitter account, "I know I shouldnt say this about one of my own speakers, but I thought Sarah Silverman was god-awful ..."[44] Anderson later deleted his tweet, but Silverman responded via her Twitter account "Kudos to [Chris Anderson] for making TED an unsafe haven for all! You're a barnacle of mediocrity on Bill Gates' asshole."[45] Anderson apologized for his tweet on his Posterous account, but also wrote "Call me stuffy, but I still think humor about terminally ill 'retarded' kids is an acquired taste ... And not a taste I personally want to acquire."[46]Nassim Taleb accused TED of intellectual dishonesty and lack of substance in the latest edition of The Black Swan (2010). He calls TED a "monstrosity that turns scientists and thinkers into low-level entertainers, like circus performers." Taleb spoke at TED2008. He claimed that the curators did not initially post his talk "warning about the financial crisis" on their website on purely cosmetic grounds.[47]Sarah Lacy of BusinessWeek and TechCrunch has criticized TED with claims of elitism. Lacy cites TED's $6,000 ticket price, poor treatment of less important attendees, and such events as a friend being "de-invited to TED after quitting an ostensibly prestigious San Francisco job" as evidence of her claims.[48] Independent blogger Robert Scoble described her stance as motivated by jealousy.

Numb3rs (/nmbrz/; stylized NUMB3RS) is an American crime drama television series that ran on CBS from January 23, 2005 to March 12, 2010. The series was created by Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, and follows FBI special agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) and his mathematical genius brother Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) who helps Don solve crimes for the FBI. Brothers Ridley and Tony Scott produced Numb3rs; its production companies are the Scott brothers' Scott Free Productions, CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Television, and later CBS Paramount Television).The show focuses equally on the relationships among Don Eppes, his brother Charlie Eppes, and their father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), and on the brothers' efforts to fight crime, normally in Los Angeles. A typical episode begins with a crime, which is subsequently investigated by a team of FBI agents led by Don and mathematically modeled by Charlie, with the help of Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol) and Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat). The insights provided by Charlie's mathematics were always in some way crucial to solving the crime.The series was the most popular show airing on Friday evenings throughout its first four seasons.[1] In May 2010, CBS announced that Numb3rs had been cancelled after six seasons.[2]The show revolved around three intersecting groups of characters: the FBI, scientists at the fictitious California Institute of Science (CalSci), and the Eppes family.Temporary characters on the show were often named after famous mathematicians. For example, in the episode "In Plain Sight" (season 2, episode 8), one of the criminals is named Rolle and Charlie's father mentions a meeting with a man named Robert Peterson.Opening: (Narrated by David Krumholtz) We all use math every day. To predict weatherto tell timeto handle money. Math is more than formulas and equations. Its logic; its rationality. Its using your mind to solve the biggest mysteries we know.The first season run of the show aired between January 23, 2005, and May 13, 2005, at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays. It sees the start of the working relationship between Los Angeles' FBI department and Charlie Eppes. The main FBI agents are Charlie's brother, Don Eppes, and Terry Lake, as well as David Sinclair. Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes, provides emotional support for the pair, while Professor Larry Fleinhardt and doctoral student Amita Ramanujan provide mathematical support and insights to Charlie. Season One was a half-season, producing only 13 episodes. Sabrina Lloyd played Terry Lake, an agent in this season; she was later replaced by Diane Farr, who played Megan Reeves.The second season run of the show aired between September 23, 2005, and May 19, 2006, again at 10:00 p.m. on Fridays. Season Two sees several changes to Don's FBI team: Terry Lake is reassigned to Washington and two new members join Don and David Sinclair: Megan Reeves and Colby Granger. Charlie is challenged on one of his long-standing pieces of mathematical work and also starts work on a new theory, Cognitive Emergence Theory. Larry sells his home and assumes a nomadic lifestyle, while he becomes romantically involved with Megan. Amita receives an offer for an assistant professor position at Harvard University, but is plagued by doubt as her relationship with Charlie is challenged and her career is in upheaval. Alan begins work and dating again, although he struggles with the loss of his wife, and both he and Charlie dream of her.Numb3rs was renewed for a third season,[3] which began airing in North America and Canada at 10:00 p.m. on Friday September 22, 2006, and ended on May 18, 2007. Charlie and Amita intensify their relationship, as do Larry and Megan, especially after Megan's kidnapping. Amita has troubles adjusting in her new role as a CalSci professor, and Larry announces his leave of absence  he will be on the International Space Station for six months, which greatly distresses Charlie. Charlie and his colleagues are troubled by Dr. Mildred Finch, the newly appointed Chair of the CalSci Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy Division, whom they learn has begun dating Alan. Meanwhile, Don dates Agent Liz Warner and questions his ethics and self-worth, and receives counseling. Charlie sees Don's therapist and the two understand one another more. Despite Don's concerns, Alan engages in some FBI consulting with his knowledge of engineering, and Larry returns from the space station, disillusioned. The finale wraps up with a revelation that Colby was actually a double agent for the Chinese.Noticeable changes from previous seasons include the removal of the opening credit sequence (credits are now done during the first segment of the show), the absence of Peter MacNicol's character for much of the season, and the absence of Diane Farr's character for a few episodes. Peter MacNicol appeared in the first eleven episodes before leaving for the television show 24, but returned to Numb3rs for the 21st episode of season 3 ("The Art of Reckoning"). His character's absence was written into the show by having him become a Payload Specialist on the International Space Station. Diane Farr, pregnant for most of the season, left the show for maternity leave in episode 18 ("Democracy"); her character's absence is explained as a special assignment to the Department of Justice.The season premiere aired on September 28, 2007, in the same time slot as in previous seasons, 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time.[4] Because of the writer's strike, only 12 episodes were initially produced. However, once the strike ended, CBS announced the show's return April 4, 2008, with six episodes.[5] The season ended on May 16, 2008.As this season starts, Colby Granger escapes from jail, and is revealed to be a triple agent. He then rejoins the team. Don and Liz break up halfway through this season, after Liz has trouble with Don's trust issues. Amita's parents come to visit, which becomes a secondary theme throughout most of the season. Due to her work at the D.O.J., Megan is conflicted by her work, and turns to Larry for help. Near the end of the season, Don's girlfriend from season 2, Robin Brooks, returns. Don and Robin then continue their relationship. Charlie attends FBI training camp because he has been working with Don for several years and wants to better understand what his brother does. In the season finale, Megan leaves the team to move back to Washington, D.C., and Charlie goes head-to-head with Don about a case. This causes Charlie to send information to scientists in Pakistan. He is subsequently arrested and has his security clearance revoked, so he can no longer help Don on cases. At the end of the episode, Don drives away to another case and Charlie admits that giving up FBI work will be harder than he expected.Several characters from previous seasons did not return in season 4. These characters include Mildred Finch and Ian Edgerton (though Edgerton appears in Seasons Five & Six).The fifth season premiered on October 3, 2008, and the season finale aired on May 15, 2009. The season premiere was moved back one week to accommodate the 2008 presidential debates.[6]Season five opens three weeks after "When Worlds Collide" (season four's season finale), with the government dropping the charges against Charlie. Charlie gets his security clearance back after he and Don fight FBI Security Officer Carl McGowan. Don begins to explore Judaism. The team adds new agent Nikki Betancourt, who arrives shortly after Megan Reeves' departure. Liz is offered a promotion but turns it down. Buck Winters (from the episodes, "Spree" and "Two Daughters") breaks out of prison and comes after Don. Alan suddenly finds himself coaching CalSci's basketball team. David becomes Don's primary relief supervisor. DARPA tries to recruit Charlie, but he turns down their offer. Toward the end of the season, Don is stabbed, and Charlie blames himself for it. The aftermath of Don's stabbing causes Charlie to focus more on his FBI consultation work. Amita is kidnapped, and the team races to find her. After she is rescued, Charlie proposes to Amita. Her response is unknown.Notes about Season Five: "Disturbed" marked the 100th episode of Numb3rs.[7]The sixth season premiered Friday September 25, 2009, at 10:00 p.m. EDT[8] and the season finale aired on March 12, 2010. The season starts with the engagement of Charlie and Amita. Soon after, Larry turns down an opportunity to meet with mathematicians at CERN, in Geneva, and drops his course load for the following semester. This leads Charlie to realize Larry is once again leaving, and leaving all of his work to Charlie. Don learns that his former mentor is crooked, causing Don angst when he has to shoot his mentor. Charlie and Don learn that Alan has lost a substantial amount of money in his 401(k). After some delay, Larry leaves Los Angeles, only to find a vacant piece of land for sale within driving distance of the city. Alan decides to return to work and finds a job as a software technical consultant. David asks Don for advice about career paths within the FBI. Larry returns from the desert with a new theory about the universe's fate. Charlie and Amita begin planning their wedding and decide to join the Big Brother/Big Sister program to practice parenting skills. They get married before their move to England to teach at the University of Cambridge. Don loses his gun, recovers it after it is used in some vigilante murders, and gets engaged. Before leaving, Charlie and Amita decide that the family garage should be converted to a guest house so Alan can continue living with them. Leaving Colby, Liz, and Nikki behind, David departs for Washington, D.C., to take a position as an anti-corruption team leader.CBS DVD (Distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment) has released all 6 seasons of Numb3rs on DVD in Region 1. The first five seasons have been released in Regions 2 & 4.Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, have won several awards for the show, including the Carl Sagan Award for Public Understanding of Science in 2006,[31] and the National Science Board's Public Service Award in 2007.[32] Also, the show's stunt coordinator, Jim Vickers, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Stunt Coordination in 2006 for episode 14 of Season 2, "Harvest".[33]Several mathematicians work as consultants for each episode.[34][35][36] Actual mathematics is presented in the show; the equations on the chalkboards are mathematically valid, and are somewhat applicable to the situations presented in each show. This mathematical validity and applicability of the equations has been asserted by professional mathematicians.[34][37][38]However, "getting the math right and getting it to fit with the plot are not priorities for the NUMB3RS team", according to creator Cheryl Heuton.[39]A book entitled The Numbers Behind Numb3rs: Solving Crime with Mathematics (ISBN 0452288576; published August 28, 2007) has been written by Keith Devlin and Dr. Gary Lorden, a consultant to the show, explaining some of the mathematical techniques that have been used both in actual FBI cases and in other law enforcement departments.[40][41]Since the premiere season, the blog[42] edited by Prof. Mark Bridger (Northeastern University) has explained the mathematics behind each episode of the show.In Denmark, a blog[43] on the mathematics in Numb3rs was established when the show premiered there. It is run by Assoc. Prof Lisbeth Fajstrup and is written in Danish.Wolfram Research (the developers of Mathematica) is the chief math consultant, reviewing scripts and providing background mathematics for the show. Starting with season four, their website in collaboration with CBS is entitled "The math behind NUMB3RS".[44]At least one mathematician consultant to the show has expressed concern with its use of mathematics, which is inserted after the script and written to provide plausible sounding jargon, rather than having consultants involved at all stages of story development.[39] Other criticisms include the show's portrayal of female mathematicians and inappropriate aspects of the relationship between Charlie Eppes and his graduate student Amita Ramanujan.[39]The idea of Numb3rs was generated in the late 1990s when Nick Falacci and Cheryl Heuton, the show's creators, attended a lecture given by Bill Nye, a popular science educator.[45] The premise of the show is similar to that of author Colin Bruce's reimaginings of the Sherlock Holmes character,[46] and to the "Mathnet" segment on the children's television show Square One.Gabriel Macht was originally cast to portray the character of Don Eppes[citation needed]. Also, the original concept for the show had the events take place at Massachusetts Institute of Technology;[47] this was later changed to the fictional California Institute of Science, commonly called CalSci. Scenes which take place at CalSci are filmed at California Institute of Technology (Caltech)[47] and the University of Southern California. One of the most frequent campus locations at Caltech is the vicinity of Millikan Library, including the bridge over Millikan Pond, the Trustees room, and the arcades of nearby buildings. At USC, locations include Doheny Library and the Town and Gown dining room. Exteriors for the FBI offices are on the distinctive bridge at Los Angeles Center Studios.[48]Another common location is the Craftsman home of the Eppes family. The house shown in the first season is real; it is owned by David Raposa and Edward Trosper,[49] although a replica set was used from the second season onwards.[50]Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of Numb3rs on CBS.[51]Note: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.Numb3rs at TV.com1 Cast and characters2 Episodes

General relativity, or the general theory of relativity, is the geometric theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1916[1] and the current description of gravitation in modern physics. General relativity generalises special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations.Some predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational time delay. The predictions of general relativity have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity is not the only relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.Einstein's theory has important astrophysical implications. For example, it implies the existence of black holesregions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escapeas an end-state for massive stars. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for example, microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and black holes of a much more massive type, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which have since been observed indirectly; a direct measurement is the aim of projects such as LIGO and NASA/ESA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and various pulsar timing arrays. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe.Soon after publishing the special theory of relativity in 1905, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations. These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter is present, and form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity.[2]The Einstein field equations are nonlinear and very difficult to solve. Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the so-called Schwarzschild metric. This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the ReissnerNordstrm solution, now associated with electrically charged black holes.[3] In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equationsthe cosmological constantto reproduce that "observation".[4] By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. Lematre used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state.[5] Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.[6]During that period, general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to Newtonian gravity, being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters ("fudge factors").[7] Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by Eddington confirmed general relativity's prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919,[8] making Einstein instantly famous.[9] Yet the theory entered the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, now known as the golden age of general relativity.[10] Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify quasars as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations.[11] Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power,[12] and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.[13]General relativity can be understood by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit of a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.[14]At the base of classical mechanics is the notion that a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration.[15] The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.[16]Conversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Etvs and its successors (see Etvs experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties.[17] A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard an accelerating rocket generating a force equal to gravity.[18]Given the universality of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force. This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and timein mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific connection which depends on the gradient of the gravitational potential. Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary Euclidean geometry. However, spacetime as a whole is more complicated. As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not integrable. From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved. The result is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system.[19] In this geometric description, tidal effectsthe relative acceleration of bodies in free fallare related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.[20]As intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is merely a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics.[21] In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincar group which also includes translations and rotations.) The differences between the two become significant when we are dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.[22]With Lorentz symmetry, additional structures come into play. They are defined by the set of light cones (see the image on the left). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there is a set of events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image). These sets are observer-independent.[23] In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the spacetime's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure.[24]Special relativity is defined in the absence of gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global inertial frames. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.[25]A priori, it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity holdthat theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity.[26] The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.[27]The same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational fieldproper time, to give the technical termdoes not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the Minkowski metric. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The metric tensor that defines the geometryin particular, how lengths and angles are measuredis not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo-Riemannian metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the Levi-Civita connection, and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable locally inertial coordinates, the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).[28]Having formulated the relativistic, geometric version of the effects of gravity, the question of gravity's source remains. In Newtonian gravity, the source is mass. In special relativity, mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the energymomentum tensor, which includes both energy and momentum densities as well as stress (that is, pressure and shear).[29] Using the equivalence principle, this tensor is readily generalized to curved space-time. Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity, it is natural to assume that the field equation for gravity relates this tensor and the Ricci tensor, which describes a particular class of tidal effects: the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest, and then fall freely. In special relativity, conservation of energymomentum corresponds to the statement that the energymomentum tensor is divergence-free. This formula, too, is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved-manifold counterparts, covariant derivatives studied in differential geometry. With this additional conditionthe covariant divergence of the energymomentum tensor, and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation, is zero the simplest set of equations are what are called Einstein's (field) equations:On the left-hand side is the Einstein tensor, a specific divergence-free combination of the Ricci tensor  and the metric. In particular,is the curvature scalar. The Ricci tensor itself is related to the more general Riemann curvature tensor asOn the right-hand side, Tab is the energymomentum tensor. All tensors are written in abstract index notation.[30] Matching the theory's prediction to observational results for planetary orbits (or, equivalently, assuring that the weak-gravity, low-speed limit is Newtonian mechanics), the proportionality constant can be fixed as  = 8G/c4, with G the gravitational constant and c the speed of light.[31] When there is no matter present, so that the energymomentum tensor vanishes, the result are the vacuum Einstein equations,There are alternatives to general relativity built upon the same premises, which include additional rules and/or constraints, leading to different field equations. Examples are BransDicke theory, teleparallelism, and EinsteinCartan theory.[32]The derivation outlined in the previous section contains all the information needed to define general relativity, describe its key properties, and address a question of crucial importance in physics, namely how the theory can be used for model-building.General relativity is a metric theory of gravitation. At its core are Einstein's equations, which describe the relation between the geometry of a four-dimensional, pseudo-Riemannian manifold representing spacetime, and the energymomentum contained in that spacetime.[33] Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow.[34] The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energymomentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.[35]While general relativity replaces the scalar gravitational potential of classical physics by a symmetric rank-two tensor, the latter reduces to the former in certain limiting cases. For weak gravitational fields and slow speed relative to the speed of light, the theory's predictions converge on those of Newton's law of universal gravitation.[36]As it is constructed using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its lawsand further laws formulated within the general relativistic frameworktake on the same form in all coordinate systems.[37] Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.[38] Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.[39]The core concept of general-relativistic model-building is that of a solution of Einstein's equations. Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold. Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energymomentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.[40]Einstein's equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and, as such, difficult to solve exactly.[41] Nevertheless, a number of exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications.[42] The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the ReissnerNordstrm solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to a certain type of black hole in an otherwise empty universe,[43] and the FriedmannLematreRobertsonWalker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos.[44] Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gdel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and Anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the Maldacena conjecture).[45]Given the difficulty of finding exact solutions, Einstein's field equations are also solved frequently by numerical integration on a computer, or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions. In the field of numerical relativity, powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes.[46] In principle, such methods may be applied to any system, given sufficient computer resources, and may address fundamental questions such as naked singularities. Approximate solutions may also be found by perturbation theories such as linearized gravity[47] and its generalization, the post-Newtonian expansion, both of which were developed by Einstein. The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light. The expansion involves a series of terms; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity, whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton's theory due to general relativity.[48] An extension of this expansion is the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions of general relativity and alternative theories.[49]General relativity has a number of physical consequences. Some follow directly from the theory's axioms, whereas others have become clear only in the course of the ninety years of research that followed Einstein's initial publication.Assuming that the equivalence principle holds,[50] gravity influences the passage of time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent in the opposite direction (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.[51]Gravitational redshift has been measured in the laboratory[52] and using astronomical observations.[53] Gravitational time dilation in the Earth's gravitational field has been measured numerous times using atomic clocks,[54] while ongoing validation is provided as a side effect of the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS).[55] Tests in stronger gravitational fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars.[56] All results are in agreement with general relativity.[57] However, at the current level of accuracy, these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid.[58]General relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.[59]This and related predictions follow from the fact that light follows what is called a light-like or null geodesica generalization of the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics. Such geodesics are the generalization of the invariance of lightspeed in special relativity.[60] As one examines suitable model spacetimes (either the exterior Schwarzschild solution or, for more than a single mass, the post-Newtonian expansion),[61] several effects of gravity on light propagation emerge. Although the bending of light can also be derived by extending the universality of free fall to light,[62] the angle of deflection resulting from such calculations is only half the value given by general relativity.[63]Closely related to light deflection is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction.[64] In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called , which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.[65]One of several analogies between weak-field gravity and electromagnetism is that, analogous to electromagnetic waves, there are gravitational waves: ripples in the metric of spacetime that propagate at the speed of light.[66] The simplest type of such a wave can be visualized by its action on a ring of freely floating particles. A sine wave propagating through such a ring towards the reader distorts the ring in a characteristic, rhythmic fashion (animated image to the right).[67] Since Einstein's equations are non-linear, arbitrarily strong gravitational waves do not obey linear superposition, making their description difficult. However, for weak fields, a linear approximation can be made. Such linearized gravitational waves are sufficiently accurate to describe the exceedingly weak waves that are expected to arrive here on Earth from far-off cosmic events, which typically result in relative distances increasing and decreasing by  or less. Data-analysis methods routinely make use of the fact that these linearized waves can be Fourier decomposed.[68]Some exact solutions describe gravitational waves without any approximation, e.g., a wave train traveling through empty space[69] or so-called Gowdy universes, varieties of an expanding cosmos filled with gravitational waves.[70] But for gravitational waves produced in astrophysically relevant situations, such as the merger of two black holes, numerical methods are presently the only way to construct appropriate models.[71]General relativity differs from classical mechanics in a number of predictions concerning orbiting bodies. It predicts an overall rotation (precession) of planetary orbits, as well as orbital decay caused by the emission of gravitational waves and effects related to the relativity of direction.In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the point of the orbiting body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precessthe orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a test particle. For him, the fact that his theory gave a straightforward explanation of the anomalous perihelion shift of the planet Mercury, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.[72]The effect can also be derived by using either the exact Schwarzschild metric (describing spacetime around a spherical mass)[73] or the much more general post-Newtonian formalism.[74] It is due to the influence of gravity on the geometry of space and to the contribution of self-energy to a body's gravity (encoded in the nonlinearity of Einstein's equations).[75] Relativistic precession has been observed for all planets that allow for accurate precession measurements (Mercury, Venus and the Earth),[76] as well as in binary pulsar systems, where it is larger by five orders of magnitude.[77]According to general relativity, a binary system will emit gravitational waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, the distance between the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the solar system or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Since the neutron stars are very compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.[79]The first observation of a decrease in orbital period due to the emission of gravitational waves was made by Hulse and Taylor, using the binary pulsar PSR1913+16 they had discovered in 1974. This was the first detection of gravitational waves, albeit indirect, for which they were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics.[80] Since then, several other binary pulsars have been found, in particular the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039, in which both stars are pulsars.[81]Several relativistic effects are directly related to the relativity of direction.[82] One is geodetic precession: the axis direction of a gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, with the direction of light received from distant starseven though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible ("parallel transport").[83] For the MoonEarth system, this effect has been measured with the help of lunar laser ranging.[84] More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0.3%.[85][86]Near a rotating mass, there are so-called gravitomagnetic or frame-dragging effects. A distant observer will determine that objects close to the mass get "dragged around". This is most extreme for rotating black holes where, for any object entering a zone known as the ergosphere, rotation is inevitable.[87] Such effects can again be tested through their influence on the orientation of gyroscopes in free fall.[88] Somewhat controversial tests have been performed using the LAGEOS satellites, confirming the relativistic prediction.[89] Also the Mars Global Surveyor probe around Mars has been used.[90][91]The deflection of light by gravity is responsible for a new class of astronomical phenomena. If a massive object is situated between the astronomer and a distant target object with appropriate mass and relative distances, the astronomer will see multiple distorted images of the target. Such effects are known as gravitational lensing.[92] Depending on the configuration, scale, and mass distribution, there can be two or more images, a bright ring known as an Einstein ring, or partial rings called arcs.[93] The earliest example was discovered in 1979;[94] since then, more than a hundred gravitational lenses have been observed.[95] Even if the multiple images are too close to each other to be resolved, the effect can still be measured, e.g., as an overall brightening of the target object; a number of such "microlensing events" have been observed.[96]Gravitational lensing has developed into a tool of observational astronomy. It is used to detect the presence and distribution of dark matter, provide a "natural telescope" for observing distant galaxies, and to obtain an independent estimate of the Hubble constant. Statistical evaluations of lensing data provide valuable insight into the structural evolution of galaxies.[97]Observations of binary pulsars provide strong indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational waves (see Orbital decay, above). However, gravitational waves reaching us from the depths of the cosmos have not been detected directly, which is a major goal of current relativity-related research.[98] Several land-based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation, most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600, LIGO (three detectors), TAMA 300 and VIRGO.[99] Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 109 to 106 Hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes.[100] European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development,[101] with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) due for launch in 2014.[102]Observations of gravitational waves promise to complement observations in the electromagnetic spectrum.[103] They are expected to yield information about black holes and other dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, about certain kinds of supernova implosions, and about processes in the very early universe, including the signature of certain types of hypothetical cosmic string.[104]Whenever the ratio of an object's mass to its radius becomes sufficiently large, general relativity predicts the formation of a black hole, a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, neutron stars of around 1.4 solar masses, and stellar black holes with a few to a few dozen solar masses, are thought to be the final state for the evolution of massive stars.[105] Usually a galaxy has one supermassive black hole with a few million to a few billion solar masses in its center,[106] and its presence is thought to have played an important role in the formation of the galaxy and larger cosmic structures.[107]Astronomically, the most important property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation.[108] Accretion, the falling of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes, is thought to be responsible for some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects, notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars.[109] In particular, accretion can lead to relativistic jets, focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed.[110] General relativity plays a central role in modelling all these phenomena,[111] and observations provide strong evidence for the existence of black holes with the properties predicted by the theory.[112]Black holes are also sought-after targets in the search for gravitational waves (cf. Gravitational waves, above). Merging black hole binaries should lead to some of the strongest gravitational wave signals reaching detectors here on Earth, and the phase directly before the merger ("chirp") could be used as a "standard candle" to deduce the distance to the merger eventsand hence serve as a probe of cosmic expansion at large distances.[113] The gravitational waves produced as a stellar black hole plunges into a supermassive one should provide direct information about the supermassive black hole's geometry.[114]The current models of cosmology are based on Einstein's field equations, which include the cosmological constant  since it has important influence on the large-scale dynamics of the cosmos,where gab is the spacetime metric.[115] Isotropic and homogeneous solutions of these enhanced equations, the FriedmannLematreRobertsonWalker solutions,[116] allow physicists to model a universe that has evolved over the past 14billionyears from a hot, early Big Bang phase.[117] Once a small number of parameters (for example the universe's mean matter density) have been fixed by astronomical observation,[118] further observational data can be used to put the models to the test.[119] Predictions, all successful, include the initial abundance of chemical elements formed in a period of primordial nucleosynthesis,[120] the large-scale structure of the universe,[121] and the existence and properties of a "thermal echo" from the early cosmos, the cosmic background radiation.[122]Astronomical observations of the cosmological expansion rate allow the total amount of matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be so-called dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly.[123] There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics[124] or otherwise.[125] Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.[126]A so-called inflationary phase,[127] an additional phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around  seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 to account for several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation.[128] Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation have resulted in the first evidence for this scenario.[129] However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations.[130] An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed[131] (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).In general relativity, no material body can catch up with or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using PenroseCarter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.[132]Aware of the importance of causal structure, Roger Penrose and others developed what is known as global geometry. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of so-called energy conditions) are used to derive general results.[133]Using global geometry, some spacetimes can be shown to contain boundaries called horizons, which demarcate one region from the rest of spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius[134]), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's horizon, is not a physical barrier.[135]Early studies of black holes relied on explicit solutions of Einstein's equations, notably the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution (used to describe a static black hole) and the axisymmetric Kerr solution (used to describe a rotating, stationary black hole, and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere). Using global geometry, later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes. In the long run, they are rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, location at a specified time and electric charge. This is stated by the black hole uniqueness theorems: "black holes have no hair", that is, no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans. Irrespective of the complexity of a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole, the object that results (having emitted gravitational waves) is very simple.[136]Even more remarkably, there is a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is analogous to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process).[137] There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy.[138] This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decreaseas long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).[139]There are other types of horizons. In an expanding universe, an observer may find that some regions of the past cannot be observed ("particle horizon"), and some regions of the future cannot be influenced (event horizon).[140] Even in flat Minkowski space, when described by an accelerated observer (Rindler space), there will be horizons associated with a semi-classical radiation known as Unruh radiation.[141]Another generaland quite disturbingfeature of general relativity is the appearance of spacetime boundaries known as singularities. Spacetime can be explored by following up on timelike and lightlike geodesicsall possible ways that light and particles in free fall can travel. But some solutions of Einstein's equations have "ragged edges"regions known as spacetime singularities, where the paths of light and falling particles come to an abrupt end, and geometry becomes ill-defined. In the more interesting cases, these are "curvature singularities", where geometrical quantities characterizing spacetime curvature, such as the Ricci scalar, take on infinite values.[142] Well-known examples of spacetimes with future singularitieswhere worldlines endare the Schwarzschild solution, which describes a singularity inside an eternal static black hole,[143] or the Kerr solution with its ring-shaped singularity inside an eternal rotating black hole.[144] The FriedmannLematreRobertsonWalker solutions and other spacetimes describing universes have past singularities on which worldlines begin, namely Big Bang singularities, and some have future singularities (Big Crunch) as well.[145]Given that these examples are all highly symmetricand thus simplifiedit is tempting to conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization.[146] The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage[147] and also at the beginning of a wide class of expanding universes.[148] However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the so-called BKL conjecture).[149] The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.[150]Each solution of Einstein's equation encompasses the whole history of a universe  it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.[151]To understand Einstein's equations as partial differential equations, it is helpful to formulate them in a way that describes the evolution of the universe over time. This is done in so-called "3+1" formulations, where spacetime is split into three space dimensions and one time dimension. The best-known example is the ADM formalism.[152] These decompositions show that the spacetime evolution equations of general relativity are well-behaved: solutions always exist, and are uniquely defined, once suitable initial conditions have been specified.[153] Such formulations of Einstein's field equations are the basis of numerical relativity.[154]The notion of evolution equations is intimately tied in with another aspect of general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational fieldlike any physical fieldmust be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.[155]Nevertheless, there are possibilities to define a system's total mass, either using a hypothetical "infinitely distant observer" (ADM mass)[156] or suitable symmetries (Komar mass).[157] If one excludes from the system's total mass the energy being carried away to infinity by gravitational waves, the result is the so-called Bondi mass at null infinity.[158] Just as in classical physics, it can be shown that these masses are positive.[159] Corresponding global definitions exist for momentum and angular momentum.[160] There have also been a number of attempts to define quasi-local quantities, such as the mass of an isolated system formulated using only quantities defined within a finite region of space containing that system. The hope is to obtain a quantity useful for general statements about isolated systems, such as a more precise formulation of the hoop conjecture.[161]If general relativity is considered one of the two pillars of modern physics, quantum theory, the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to solid state physics, is the other.[162] However, it is still an open question as to how the concepts of quantum theory can be reconciled with those of general relativity.Ordinary quantum field theories, which form the basis of modern elementary particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth.[163] In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime. These theories rely on classical general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime.[164] Using this formalism, it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation, leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time.[165] As briefly mentioned above, this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes.[166]The demand for consistency between a quantum description of matter and a geometric description of spacetime,[167] as well as the appearance of singularities (where curvature length scales become microscopic), indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity: for an adequate description of the interior of black holes, and of the very early universe, a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics.[168] Despite major efforts, no complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity is currently known, even though a number of promising candidates exist.[169]Attempts to generalize ordinary quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, so as to include gravity have led to serious problems. At low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity.[170] At very high energies, however, the result are models devoid of all predictive power ("non-renormalizability").[171]One attempt to overcome these limitations is string theory, a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects.[172] The theory promises to be a unified description of all particles and interactions, including gravity;[173] the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three.[174] In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity[175] form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity.[176]Another approach starts with the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), the result is the WheelerdeWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrdinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined.[177] However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables,[178] this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.[179]Depending on which features of general relativity and quantum theory are accepted unchanged, and on what level changes are introduced,[180] there are numerous other attempts to arrive at a viable theory of quantum gravity, some examples being dynamical triangulations,[181] causal sets,[182] twistor models[183] or the path-integral based models of quantum cosmology.[184]All candidate theories still have major formal and conceptual problems to overcome. They also face the common problem that, as yet, there is no way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.[185]General relativity has emerged as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. However, there are strong indications the theory is incomplete.[186] The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open.[187] Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics.[188] Even taken as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration. Mathematical relativists seek to understand the nature of singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations,[189] and increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes) are run.[190] The race for the first direct detection of gravitational waves continues,[191] in the hope of creating opportunities to test the theory's validity for much stronger gravitational fields than has been possible to date.[192] More than ninety years after its publication, general relativity remains a highly active area of research.[193]   vte1 History2 From classical mechanics to general relativity

$74,854,777Roger Federer (German pronunciation: [fedrr]; born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss professional tennis player who as of November 2012[update] is ranked World No. 2 by the ATP. Many sports analysts, tennis critics and former and current players consider Federer the greatest tennis player of all time.[a] He owns several men's world records of the Open Era: holding the World No. 1 position for 302 weeks overall;[15][16] a 237-consecutive-week stretch at the top from 2004 to 2008;[17] winning 17 Grand Slam singles titles; reaching the finals of each Grand Slam tournament at least five times (an all-time record); and reaching the Wimbledon final eight times. He is one of seven men, and one of four in the Open Era, to capture the career Grand Slam, and one of three (with Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal) to do so separately on clay, grass, and hard courts. Federer also shares the Open Era record for most Grand Slam titles at the Australian Open with Agassi (4 titles), at Wimbledon with Pete Sampras (7 titles) and at the US Open with Jimmy Connors and Sampras (5 titles). Federer's ATP tournament records include winning six ATP World Tour Finals, winning 21 ATP Masters 1000 titles (a record shared with Nadal), playing in the finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (a record matched by Novak Djokovic), and one of the three (alongside Agassi and Djokovic) in winning seven.Federer has appeared in 24 men's Grand Slam finals, with ten in a row, both records, and appeared in 18 of 19 finals from the 2005 Wimbledon Championships through to the 2010 Australian Open. He is the only man to reach the semifinals of 23 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments, from the 2004 Wimbledon Championships through the 2010 Australian Open.[18] At the 2012 Wimbledon men's championship, he reached his 32nd Grand Slam semi-final and seventh trophy, both records. At the 2012 US Open, he reached a record consecutive 34th Grand Slam quarter-final. He has also won the most matches, 247, in men's Grand Slam tournaments. He also won the Olympic gold medal in doubles with his compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games and the Olympic silver medal in singles at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. He spent eight years (20032010) continuously in the top 2 in the year-end men's rankings and ten (20032012) in the Top 3. His rivalries with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, making for a "trivalry", are considered some of the greatest of all time.Federer has won the ATPWorldTour.com Fans' Favorite Award a record ten times straight (20032012) and the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award (voted for by the players) a record eight times (20042009, 2011-2012)[19], both being awards indicative of respect and popularity. He also won the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year Award in 2006. In 2011, in a South African poll, he was voted the second most trusted and respected person in the world, next to Nelson Mandela.[20][21] He was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year for a record four consecutive years (20052008).[22] Federer is at times referred to as the Federer Express,[23] shortened to Fed Express or FedEx, and the Swiss Maestro,[23] or just Maestro.[23][24][25][26]Federer was born in Binningen, Switzerland near Basel, to Swiss national Robert Federer and South African-born Lynette Durand, of Dutch and French Huguenot ancestry.[27][28][29] He holds both Swiss and South African citizenship.[30] He grew up in nearby Mnchenstein, close to the French and German borders and speaks Swiss German, German, French and English fluently, Swiss German being his native language.[29][31][32] He was raised as a Roman Catholic and met Pope Benedict XVI while playing the 2006 Internazionali BNL d'Italia tournament in Rome.[33] Like all male Swiss citizens, Federer was subject to compulsory military service in the Swiss Armed Forces. However, in 2003 he was deemed unfit because of a long-standing back problem and was subsequently not required to fulfill his military obligation.[34] Federer himself also credits the range of sports he played as a childhe also played badminton, cricket and basketballfor his hand-eye coordination. Federer has stated in various interviews that he is an "avid cricket fan", having met Sachin Tendulkar twice. "I was always very much more interested if a ball was involved," he says. Most tennis prodigies, by contrast, play tennis to the exclusion of all other sports.[35] In later life, Federer has been friends with the golfer Tiger Woods.[36]Federer is married to former Women's Tennis Association player Mirka Vavrinec. He met her while both were competing for Switzerland in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Vavrinec retired from the tour in 2002 because of a foot injury and has since been working as Federer's public relations manager.[37] They were married at Wenkenhof Villa in Riehen near Basel on 11 April 2009, surrounded by a small group of close friends and family.[38] On 23 July 2009, Mirka gave birth to identical twin girls, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva.[39]Federer supports a number of charities. He established the Roger Federer Foundation in 2003 to help disadvantaged people and to promote sports.[40][41] In 2005, he auctioned his racquet from his US Open championship to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina.[42] He was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador by UNICEF in 2006.[43] At the 2005 Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, Federer arranged an exhibition involving several top players from the ATP tour and WTA tour called Rally for Relief. The proceeds from the event went to the victims of the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Since then, he has visited South Africa and Tamil Nadu, one of the areas in India most affected by the tsunami.[44] He has also appeared in UNICEF public messages to raise public awareness of AIDS. In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Federer arranged a collaboration with fellow top tennis players Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Roddick, Kim Clijsters, Serena Williams, Lleyton Hewitt, and Sam Stosur to forgo their final day of preparation for the 2010 Australian Open to form a special charity event called Hit for Haiti, in which all proceeds went to Haiti earthquake victims.[45] He was named a 2010 Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum in recognition of his leadership, accomplishments, and contributions to society.[46]Similar to the 2010 event, Hit for Haiti, Federer organized and participated in a charity match called Rally for Relief on 16 January 2011, to benefit those that were affected by the 20102011 Queensland floods.Federer is currently number 31 on Forbes top 100 celebrities as of May 2012.[47]Federer's main accomplishments as a junior player came at Wimbledon in 1998, where he won both the boys' singles final over Irakli Labadze,[48] and in doubles teamed with Olivier Rochus, defeating the team of Michal Llodra and Andy Ram.[49] In addition, Federer lost the US Open Junior final in 1998 to David Nalbandian. He won four ITF junior singles tournaments in his career, including the prestigious Orange Bowl, where he defeated Guillermo Coria in the final.[50] He ended 1998 with the No. 1 junior world ranking, and he entered his first tournament as a professional during 1998 in Gstaad, where he lost to Lucas Arnold Ker in the first round.Junior Grand Slam results:Australian Open: SF (1998)
French Open: 1R (1998)
Wimbledon: W (1998)
US Open: F (1998)Federer's first final came at the Marseille Open in 2000, where he lost to fellow Swiss Marc Rosset.[51] Federer won the 2001 Hopman Cup representing Switzerland, along with Martina Hingis.[52][53] The duo defeated the American pair of Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill in the finals. Federer's first singles win was at the 2001 Milan Indoor tournament, where he defeated Julien Boutter.[51] Although he won his first ever title already in 1999 on the challenger tour, winning the doubles event in Segovia, Spain together with Dutchman Sander Groen, the finals was played on Federer's 18th birthday. In 2001, Federer made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open, and at Wimbledon that same year defeated four-time defending champion Pete Sampras to reach the quarterfinals. The most prestigious event final he reached during this period was the 2002 Miami Masters event, where he lost to Andre Agassi, on hard court.[54] In addition, Federer won his first Master Series event at the 2002 Hamburg Masters on clay, over Marat Safin; the victory made him a top-10 player for the first time.[54] Federer made 10 singles finals between 1998 and 2002, of which he won four and lost six.[51][54][55][56][57] He also made six finals in doubles. Of note are Federer and partner Max Mirnyi's defeat in the final of the Indian Wells Masters in 2002, and their victory in the same year in the final of the Rotterdam 500 series event. Federer had won the latter a year earlier with partner Jonas Bjrkman.[54][57] He finished 2001 with an ATP ranking of 13th, 2002 was the first year he finished within the top 10, finishing 6th.In 2003, Federer won his first Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, beating Mark Philippoussis.[58] Federer won his first and only doubles Masters Series 1000 event in Miami with Max Mirnyi,[59] and made it to one singles Masters Series 1000 event in Rome on clay, which he lost.[58] Federer made it to nine finals on the ATP Tour and won seven of them, including the 500 series events at Dubai and Vienna.[58] Lastly, Federer won the year-end championships over Andre Agassi finishing the year as world number 2, narrowly behind Andy Roddick.[58]During 2004, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles for the first time in his career and became the first person to do so since Mats Wilander in 1988. His first Grand Slam hard-court title came at the Australian Open over Marat Safin thereby becoming the world number 1 for the first time. He then won his second Wimbledon crown over Andy Roddick.[60] Federer defeated the 2001 US Open champion, Lleyton Hewitt, at the US Open for his first title there.[60] Federer won three ATP Masters Series 1000 events, one was on clay in Hamburg, and the other two were on hard surfaces at Indian Wells and Canada.[60] Federer took the ATP 500 series event at Dubai and wrapped up the year by winning the year-end championships for the second time.[60] He improved his year-end ranking to world number 1 for the first time.In 2005, Federer failed to reach the finals of the first two Grand Slam tournaments, losing the Australian Open semifinal to eventual champion Safin and the French Open semifinal to eventual champion Rafael Nadal.[61] However, Federer quickly reestablished his dominance on grass, winning the Wimbledon Championships over Andy Roddick. At the US Open, Federer defeated Andre Agassi in the latter's last Grand Slam final.[61] Federer also took four ATP Masters Series 1000 wins: Indian Wells, Miami, and Cincinnati on hard court, and Hamburg on clay.[61] Furthermore, Federer won two ATP 500 series events at Rotterdam and Dubai.[61] Federer lost the year-end championships to David Nalbandian in the final but maintained his position as world number 1.[61]In 2006, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and reached the final of the other, with the only loss coming against Nadal in the French Open. He was the first man to reach all four finals in a calender year since Rod Laver in 1969. This was Federer and Nadal's first meeting in a Grand Slam final.[62] Federer defeated Nadal in the Wimbledon Championships final. In the Australian Open, Federer defeated Marcos Baghdatis,[62] and at the US Open, Federer defeated Roddick (2003 champion).[62] In addition, Federer made it to six ATP Masters Series 1000 finals, winning four on hard surfaces and losing two on clay to Nadal. Federer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo and captured the year-end championships for the third time in his career, again finishing the year as world number 1.[62]In 2007, Federer reached all four Grand Slam singles finals, winning three of them again. He won the Australian Open over Fernando Gonzlez, Wimbledon over Rafael Nadal for the second time, and the US Open over Novak Djokovic. Federer lost the French Open to Nadal.[63] Federer made five ATP Masters Series 1000 finals in 2007, winning the Hamburg and Cincinnati titles.[63] Federer won one 500 series event in Dubai and won the year-end championships.[63] He finished as the year-end world number 1 for the fourth year in a row, demonstrating his dominance, and in these four years he won 11 grand slams.In 2008, Federer won one Grand Slam singles title at the US Open over Briton Andy Murray.[64] Federer was defeated by Nadal in two Grand Slam finals, at the French Open, and at Wimbledon, when he was going for six straight wins to break Bjrn Borg's record.[64] At the Australian Open, Federer lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Djokovic, which ended his record of 10 consecutive finals.[64] Later in the year it was found Federer had been suffering from mononucleosis at the start of the year, including during the Australian Open. He lost twice in Master Series 1000 finals on clay to Nadal, at Monte Carlo and Hamburg.[64] However, Federer captured two titles in 250-level events at Estoril and Halle and one title in a 500 level event in Basel. At the Olympic Games, Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka won the gold medal in doubles[65], but Federer could only reach the quarter finals in the singles draw, knocked out by then world number 8 James Blake.[66] He ended the year as world number 2.In 2009, Federer won two Grand Slam singles titles, the French Open over Robin Sderling, and Wimbledon over Andy Roddick.[67] Federer reached two other Grand Slam finals, losing to Nadal at the Australian Open[68], and to Juan Martn del Potro at the US Open, both in tight 5-set matches.[67] Federer won two more events, the first at the Madrid Masters over Nadal in the final on clay.[67] The second was in Cincinnati over Djokovic, although Federer lost to Djokovic in Basel, later in the year.[67] Federer completed a career Grand Slam by winning his first French Open title and won a men's record fifteenth Grand Slam singles title by defeating Andy Roddick at Wimbledon in five sets, surpassing Pete Sampras's mark of fourteen.[67]In 2010, Federer slowed down in his milestones and achievements. The year started with a win at the Australian Open,[69] where he defeated Andy Murray in the final and extended his Grand Slam singles record to sixteen titles, matching Andre Agassi's record of four Australian Open titles.[64] At the French Open, Federer won his 700th tour match and 150th tour match on clay.[69][70] However, he failed to reach a Grand Slam semifinal for the first time since the 2004 French Open, losing to Sderling in the quarterfinals and relinquishing his no. 1 ranking,[69] having been just one week away from equaling Pete Sampras's record of 286 weeks as world no. 1. In a huge upset at Wimbledon, Federer lost in the quarterfinal to Tom Berdych and fell to no. 3 in the rankings for the first time in 6 years and 8 months.[69][71][72] At the 2010 US Open, Federer reached the semifinals, avenging his French Open loss to Sderling in the quarterfinals, but proceeded to lose a five-set match to third seed Novak Djokovic.[69] Federer made it to four Masters 1000 finals, losing three of them (the Madrid Open, the Canadian Masters, and the Shanghai Masters), while winning the Cincinnati Masters against Mardy Fish.[73] In 2010 Federer equaled Agassi for the number of Masters wins at 17 and tied Bjorn Borg's mark for number of total titles won, moving to just one behind Sampras. Towards the middle of July, Federer hired Pete Sampras' old coach Paul Annacone to put his tennis game and career on the right path on a trial basis.[74] Federer won two lesser titles at the Stockholm Open and the Davidoff Swiss Indoors, which brought his tally to 65 career titles. Lastly, Federer won the year-end championships by beating rival Rafael Nadal, for his fifth title at the event. He showed much of his old form, beating all contenders except Nadal in straight sets. Since Wimbledon 2010, Federer had a win-loss record of 344 and had multiple match points in two of his losses: to Novak Djokovic in the semifinal of the US Open, and to Gal Monfils in the semifinal of the Paris Masters. Federer did not play in the 2010 Davis Cup[75] and finished the year as world no. 2.The 2011 season, although great by most players' standards, was a lean year for Federer. He was defeated in straight sets in the semifinals of the 2011 Australian Open by eventual champion Novak Djokovic[76], marking the first time since July 2003 that he did not hold any of the four Major titles. In the French Open semifinal, Federer ended Djokovic's undefeated streak of 43 consecutive wins with a stunning four-set victory. However, Federer then lost in the final to Rafael Nadal. At Wimbledon, Federer advanced to his 29th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal, but lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. It marked the first time in his career that he had lost a Grand Slam match after winning the first two sets. At the US Open, Federer lost a much-anticipated semifinal match with Novak Djokovic, after squandering two match points in the fifth set which repeated his previous year's result against Djokovic and added a second loss from two sets up in Grand Slam play to his record. The loss at Flushing Meadows meant that Federer did not win any of the four Majors in 2011, the first time this has happened since 2002. In pulling out of the 2011 Shanghai Masters, Federer dropped out of the top 3 for the first time since June 2003, nearly 8 1/2 previously.[77] However, he finished the season on a high note by winning his last three tournaments of the year. He ended a 10-month title drought (spanning since the Qatar Open in January) and won the Swiss Indoors for the fifth time, defeating youngster Kei Nishikori, who had defeated an ailing Djokovic in the semifinals. Federer followed this up with his first Paris Masters title, where he became the first player to reach all nine Masters 1000 finals. At the 2011 ATP World Tour Finals, Federer crushed Rafael Nadal in exactly one hour en route to the semifinals,[78] where he defeated David Ferrer to reach the final at the year-end championships for the seventh time, his 100th tour-level final overall. As a result of this win, Federer also regained the world no. 3 ranking from Andy Murray. In the final, he defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for the third consecutive Sunday and, in doing so, claimed a record sixth ATP World Tour Finals title, finishing the year as world no. 3.[79]Federer began his 2012 season with the Qatar Open, where he withdrew in the semifinals. He then played in the 2012 Australian Open, where he reached the semifinals, setting up a 27th career meeting with Nadal, a match he lost in four tight sets. He participated in the Davis Cup representing Switzerland in the 2012 Davis Cup World Group, but Switzerland was eliminated in a home tie against the United States played on indoor clay in Fribourg. The loss included a four-set defeat for Federer at the hands of John Isner, as well as a tight four-set loss with Stanislas Wawrinka in the doubles rubber against Mardy Fish and Mike Bryan. He then played the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament for the first time since winning the title in 2005. He beat Juan Martin del Potro in the final to clinch his second title in Rotterdam. Federer played in the 2012 Dubai Tennis Championships, where he defeated Andy Murray in the final, improved his record against him to 78, and won the championship title for the fifth time in his career. Federer then moved on to the Indian Wells Masters, where he defeated Rafael Nadal in the semifinal, and John Isner in the final. Federer won the title for a record fourth time, and, in doing so, equalled Rafael Nadal's record of 19 ATP Masters 1000 titles. Federer then lost in the third round of the Miami Masters to Andy Roddick in three sets. Federer went on to compete at the Madrid Masters on the new blue clay surface, where he beat Milos Raonic, Richard Gasquet, David Ferrer, Janko Tipsarevic, and Tom Berdych en route to regaining the world no. 2 ranking from Rafael Nadal. Federer then participated in the Italian Open tournament in Rome, where he won over Carlos Berlocq, Juan Carlos Ferrero, and Andreas Seppi, en route to the semifinal, where he was defeated in straight sets by the defending champion and 2012 runner-up Novak Djokovic. In the French Open, Federer won matches against Tobias Kamke, Adrian Ungur, Nicolas Mahut, David Goffin, and Juan Martn del Potro before he lost in the semifinal to Djokovic.[80] At the Gerry Weber Open, Federer lost to an inspired Tommy Haas in the final.[81]At Wimbledon, Federer won matches against Albert Ramos, Fabio Fognini, Julien Benneteau, Xavier Malisse, and Mikhail Youzhny on his way to reaching the semifinals. In his semifinal match-up against the world no. 1 Novak Djokovic, Federer earned a record eighth Wimbledon final appearance after dispatching Djokovic in four sets. On 8 July 2012, Federer defeated Andy Murray in four sets in the 2012 Wimbledon Final,[82] regaining the world number-one ranking in the process.[83] "It's amazing. It equals me with Pete Sampras, who's my hero. It just feels amazing," Federer said of winning his seventh Wimbledon championship, tying Sampras' Open Era record.[84] By defeating top-ranked Djokovic in the semifinals and winning in the finals, Federer returned to the top spot in the world rankings and in doing so, broke Sampras' record of 286 weeks atop the list.[85]Four weeks after the Wimbledon final, Federer again faced Murray on the Wimbledon centre court, this time for the final of the 2012 Summer Olympics. This came after a monster match in the semifinals against Juan Martin del Potro that went to 1917 in the final set. In the final, he lost to Murray and won a silver medal for his country.[86]Federer did not play in the Rogers Cup, but he won in Cincinnati, beating Novak Djokovic soundly in the final.[87] In the US Open, five-time champ Federer was defeated by Tom Berdych, 67(1), 46, 63, 36, in the quarterfinals.[88] In the Shanghai Rolex Masters, defeating Stanislas Wawrinka in the third round, confirmed his 300th week at No.1. Following his defeat against Juan Martin del Potro in the title match at the Swiss Indoors[89], Federer withdrew from the Paris Master[90], thus losing his chance to finish as year-end No. 1 for a sixth time. Federer made it to the finals of ATP World Tour Finals where he lost to Novak Djokovic 7-6 (8/6), 7-5.[91]Federer and Nadal have been playing each other since 2004 and their rivalry is a significant part of both men's careers.[92][93][94][95][96]They held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 until 14 September 2009, when Nadal fell to World number 3 (Andy Murray became the new number 2).[97] They are the only pair of men to have ever finished four consecutive calendar years at the top. Federer was ranked number 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks beginning in February 2004. Nadal, who is five years younger, ascended to number 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for a record 160 consecutive weeks before surpassing Federer in August 2008.[98]Nadal leads their head-to-head 1810. Fourteen of their 28 matches have been on clay which is statistically Nadal's best surface.[99] Federer has a winning record on grass (21) and indoor hard courts (40), while Nadal leads the outdoor hard courts (52) and clay (122).[100] Because tournament seedings are based on rankings, 19 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all-time record 8 Grand Slam finals.[101] From 2006 to 2008 they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final. They then met in the 2009 Australian Open final and the 2011 French Open final. Nadal won six of the eight, losing the first two Wimbledon finals. Three of these finals were five set-matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 Australian Open), with the 2008 Wimbledon final being lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts.[102][103][104][105] 10 of their 28 meetings have reached a deciding set. They have also played in a record 9 Masters Series finals (tied with Nadal-Djokovic finals), including their lone five hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth-set tie-break having saved two match points.Federer and Djokovic have met 28 times with Federer leading 1613. Federer leads 1210 on hard-courts and 10 on grass. They are tied at 33 on clay. The FedererDjokovic rivalry is the largest rivalry in Grand Slam history with a record 11 matches played against each other and Federer leading 65. Djokovic is the only player besides Nadal to have defeated Federer more than once in a Grand Slam tournament since 2004, the only player besides Nadal to defeat Federer in consecutive grand slam tournaments (2010 US Open and 2011 Australian Open), and the only player besides Nadal who has double-figure career wins over Federer. Djokovic is one of two players (the other again being Nadal) currently on tour to have defeated Federer in straight sets at a Grand Slam (2008 Australian Open, 2011 Australian Open, 2012 French Open) and the only player to do it three times. 11 of their 28 meetings have reached a deciding set.Federer ended Djokovic's perfect 410 start to the 2011 season in the semifinals of the French Open, but Djokovic was able to avenge this loss at the 2011 US Open in five sets after saving two match points against Federer for the second straight year.[106] In the semifinals of Wimbledon 2012, Federer beat defending champion and world number one Djokovic in four sets.[107] Many experts have included the rivalry between Federer and Djokovic as one of the best rivalries in the Open Era.[108]Federer and Andy Murray have met 19 times with the series led 109 by Murray. Murray leads 98 on hard courts and they are tied 11 on grass.[109] The two have met three times at Grand Slam level, each time in the final, and Federer has won all three of these matches; at the 2008 US Open[110] and the 2010 Australian Open,[111] both of which he won in straight sets, and at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships in which Murray took the opening set but went on to lose in four sets. However, Murray leads 61 in ATP 1000 tournaments. They have also met four times at the ATP World Tour Finals with Murray winning in Shanghai in 2008,[112] and Federer in London in 2009, 2010, and 2012.[113] Apart from Nadal, Murray is the only other active player to have a positive head-to-head record against Federer.Federer and Lleyton Hewitt have played each other on 26 occasions. Early in their careers, Hewitt dominated Federer winning seven of their first nine meetings including a victory from two sets to love down in the deciding rubber of the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. However, from 2004 onward, Federer has dominated the rivalry winning 16 of the last 17 meetings to emerge with an 188 overall head-to-head record.[114] This is Federer's longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. Their one Grand Slam final meeting came at the 2004 US Open where Federer beat Hewitt to win his first US Open title. Federer is 90 against Hewitt in Grand Slams and has won six of the Grand Slams in which he has defeated Hewitt.One of Federer's longstanding rivalries was with American Andy Roddick. Roddick lost his World number 1 ranking to Federer after Federer won his first Australian Open in 2004. Federer and Roddick have met on 24 occasions, including in four Grand Slam finals (three at Wimbledon and one at the US Open). Federer leads 213, making Roddick the ATP player with the most tournament losses to Federer. [115]In the 2009 Wimbledon final, Roddick lost to Federer in five sets. It included a fifth set made up of 30 games (a Grand Slam final record) and a match that was over 4 hours long. In the final game of the deciding set Roddick's serve was broken for the first, and therefore last, time during the whole match. With that victory, Federer broke Pete Sampras' record of 14 Grand Slam titles.David Nalbandian was arguably Federer's biggest rival earlier in his career. Both players had an outstanding junior career with Federer winning the Wimbledon junior title and Nalbandian winning the US Open junior title (beating Federer). Even though Federer has a narrow advantage against Nalbandian, leading their meetings 118, Nalbandian beat Federer in their first five meetings after turning professional which included fourth round meetings at the Australian Open and US Open in 2003. Their most impressive match was the final of the 2005 Shanghai Tennis Masters Cup where Nalbandian came back from being two sets to love down against Federer and ultimately prevailed in a fifth set tiebreak. The loss prevented Federer from tying John McEnroe's 823 all-time single year record, set in 1984. Nalbandian and Lleyton Hewitt have beaten Federer 8 times with only Rafael Nadal (18), Novak Djokovic (12), and Andy Murray (9), recording more victories over Federer.Federer has played Juan Martin del Potro on 17 occasions, with the series lead by Federer 134. Federer leads 84 on hard courts, 30 on grass and 20 on clay. They have met three times in finals, with del Potro most notably triumphing at the 2009 US Open becoming the first man to defeat Federer from a deficit of 2 sets to 1 in a grand slam final 36, 76(75), 46, 76(74), 62. In 2012, Del Potro also defeated Federer at the final of the 2012 Swiss Indoors, whereas Federer won their final encounter at the Rotterdam Open. In winning the 2009 US Open final, del Potro became the only player other than Federer, Nadal or Djokovic to win a Grand Slam title in 30 tournaments, and the first player to defeat Federer at the US Open in 6 years.[116] Federer and del Potro also met at the semifinals of the 2012 Summer Olympics, where the two recorded the longest match in Olympic tennis history with Federer eventually emerging victorious 36, 76(75), 1917 in 4 hours and 26 minutes.[117] The pair's most recent meeting came at the 2012 ATP World Tour Finals in both men's final round robin match where del Potro was the eventual winner 76(73), 46, 63.Marat Safin and Federer have played each other 12 times with Federer leading 102. Atp World Tour features updated information on Federer and Safin's head to head statistics. [118] Federer and Safin turned pro within one year of each other with Safin turning pro in 1997 and Federer turning pro in 1998. Federer leads 41 on hard courts, 30 on grass, and 30 on clay courts while Safin leads 10 on carpet. Federer defeated Safin at the 2002 Hamburg Masters to win his first Masters 1000 title of his career. Federer would also defeat Safin in the finals of the 2004 Australian Open to capture his first Australian Open and second slam title. However, Safin would defeat Federer in the 2005 Australian Open semifinals 5-7, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6(86), 9-7 having saved one match point in the fourth set tiebreak to end a 26 match win streak by Federer.[119] They have met each other 5 times in Grand Slams with Federer leading 41.Federer's versatility has been summarised by Jimmy Connors: "In an era of specialists, you're either a clay court specialist, a grass court specialist, or a hard court specialist...or you're Roger Federer."[120]Federer is an all-court, all-round player known for his speed, fluid style of play, and exceptional shot making. Federer mainly plays from the baseline but is also comfortable at the net, being one of the best volleyers in the game today. He has a powerful, accurate smash and very effectively performs rare elements in today's tennis, such as backhand smash, half-volley and jump smash (slam dunk). David Foster Wallace compared the brute force of Federer's forehand motion with that of "a great liquid whip,"[121] while John McEnroe has referred to Federer's forehand as "the greatest shot in our sport."[122] Federer is also known for his efficient movement around the court and excellent footwork, which enables him to run around shots directed to his backhand and instead hit a powerful inside-out or inside-in forehand, one of his best shots.Federer plays with a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. Federer's forehand and backhand slice are both thought by many to be the best ever. He employs the slice, occasionally using it to lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net.[121] His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve he is going to hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph);[123][124][125] however, he is capable of serving at 220km/h (137mph).[123][124] Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying,[126] and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.[127] His speciality is a half-volley from the baseline which enables him to play close to the baseline and to pick up even the deeper shots very early after they bounce, giving his opponents less time to react.[citation needed] Later in his career Federer added the drop shot to his arsenal, and can perform a well-disguised one off both wings. He sometimes uses a between-the-legs shot, which is colloquially referred to as a "tweener." His most notable use of the tweener was in the semifinals of the 2009 US Open against Novak Djokovic, bringing him triple match point, on which he capitalised for a straight-set victory over the Serb.[128]Federer currently plays with a customised Wilson Pro Staff 6.1 90 BLX tennis racquet,[129] which is characterised by its smaller hitting area of 90 square inches, heavy strung weight of 364grams, and thin beam of 17.5 millimeters. His grip size is 4 3/8inches (sometimes referred to as L3).[130] Federer strings his racquets at 21.5kg mains/20kg crosses pre stretched 20%, utilizing Wilson Natural Gut 16 gauge for his main strings and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough 16L gauge (polyester) for his cross strings.[130] When asked about string tensions, Federer stated "this depends on how warm the days are and with what kind of balls I play and against who I play. So you can see it depends on several factors and not just the surface; the feeling I have is most important."[131]Federer is one of the highest-earning athletes in the world. Forbes listed him as number 4 in their list of the top 50 highest-paid athletes in 2011.[132] He has a contract with Nike footwear and apparel.[133] For the 2006 championships at Wimbledon, Nike designed a jacket emblazoned with a crest of three tennis racquets, symbolising the three Wimbledon Championships he had previously won, and which was updated the next year with four racquets after he won the Championship in 2006.[134] In Wimbledon 2008 and again in 2009, Nike continued this trend by making him a personalised cardigan.[135] He also has his own logo, an R and F joined together.[136] Federer endorses Gillette,[137] Jura, a Swiss-based coffee machine company,[138] as well as Mercedes-Benz and NetJets. Federer also endorses Rolex watches,[139] although he was previously an ambassador for Maurice Lacroix.[140] Also in 2009 Federer became brand ambassador for Swiss chocolate makers Lindt.[141] In 2010 his endorsement by Mercedes-Benz China was extended into a global Mercedes-Benz partnership deal.[142]Information in these tables is updated only once the player's participation in the tournament has concluded.       1stall-timeleaderinearnings1 Personal life

House (also known as House, M.D.) is an American television medical drama that originally ran on the Fox network for eight seasons from November 16, 2004, to May 21, 2012. The show's main character is Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), a drug-addicted, unconventional, misanthropic medical genius who leads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional PrincetonPlainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The shows premise originated with Paul Attanasio, while David Shore, who is credited as creator, was primarily responsible for the conception of the title character. The shows executive producers include Shore, Attanasio, Attanasios business partner Katie Jacobs, and film director Bryan Singer. It was largely filmed in Century City.House often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patients illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights. His flouting of hospital rules and procedures frequently leads him into conflict with his boss, hospital administrator and Dean of Medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). Houses only true friend is Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), head of the Department of Oncology. During the first three seasons, Houses diagnostic team consists of Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). At the end of the third season, this team disbands. Rejoined by Foreman, House gradually selects three new team members: Dr. Remy Thirteen Hadley (Olivia Wilde), Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), and Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn). Kutner makes his final appearance late in season five. Chase and Cameron continue to appear in different roles at the hospital until early in season six. Cameron then departs the hospital, and Chase returns to the diagnostic team. Thirteen takes a leave of absence for most of season seven, and her position is filled by medical student Martha M. Masters (Amber Tamblyn). Cuddy and Masters depart before season eight; Foreman becomes the new dean of medicine, while Dr. Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) and Dr. Chi Park (Charlyne Yi) join Houses team.Critically acclaimed for the first half of its run, House was among the top-ten rated shows in the United States from its second through its fourth season. Distributed to 66 countries, House was the most watched television program in the world in 2008.[1] The show received numerous awards, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Peabody Award, and nine People's Choice Awards. On February 8, 2012, Fox announced that the eighth season, then in progress, would be Houses last.[2] The series finale aired on May 21, 2012, following an hour-long retrospective.In 2004, David Shore and Paul Attanasio, along with Attanasio's business partner Katie Jacobs, pitched the show (untitled at the time) to Fox as a CSI-style medical detective program,[3] a hospital whodunit in which the doctors investigated symptoms and their causes.[4] Attanasio was inspired to develop a medical procedural drama by The New York Times Magazine column "Diagnosis", written by physician Lisa Sanders, who is an attending physician at Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH), and Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) is modeled after this teaching institution.[5] Fox bought the series, though the network's then-president, Gail Berman, told the creative team, "I want a medical show, but I don't want to see white coats going down the hallway".[6] Jacobs has said that this stipulation was one of the many influences that led to the show's ultimate form.[6]We knew the network was looking for procedurals, and Paul [Attanasio] came up with this medical idea that was like a cop procedural. The suspects were the germs. I mean, germs don't have motives.After Fox picked up the show, it acquired the working title Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain[8] ("zebra" is medical slang for an unusual or obscure diagnosis, while "circling the drain" refers to terminal cases, patients in an irreversible decline).[9] The original premise of the show was of a team of doctors working together trying to "diagnose the undiagnosable".[10] Shore felt it was important to have an interesting central character, one who could examine patients' personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies.[10] As Shore and the rest of the creative team explored the character's possibilities, the program concept became less of a procedural and more focused upon the lead role.[11] The character was named "House", which was adopted as the show's title as well.[8] Shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the pilot episode.[3] Bryan Singer, who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles, has said that the "title of the pilot was 'Everybody Lies', and that's the premise of the show".[11] Shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of Berton Rouech, a staff writer for The New Yorker between 1944 and 1994, who specialized in features about unusual medical cases.[4]Shore traced the concept for the title character to his experience as a patient at a teaching hospital.[12] Shore recalled: "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [for my cluelessness] and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room."[13] A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way.[14] The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox rejected this. Jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network's insistence that the character be reimaginedputting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension.[11] The writers ultimately chose to give House a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis, which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency.[14]Similarities between Gregory House and the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle appear throughout the series.[15][16] Shore explained that he was always a Holmes fan and found the character's indifference to his clients unique.[13] The resemblance is evident in House's reliance on deductive reasoning[15] and psychology, even where it might not seem obviously applicable,[9] and his reluctance to accept cases he finds uninteresting.[17] His investigatory method is to eliminate diagnoses logically as they are proved impossible; Holmes used a similar method.[8] Both characters play instruments (House plays the piano, the guitar, and the harmonica; Holmes, the violin) and take drugs (House is addicted to Vicodin; Holmes uses cocaine recreationally).[15] House's relationship with Dr. James Wilson echoes that between Holmes and his confidant, Dr. John Watson.[8] Robert Sean Leonard, who portrays Wilson, said that House and his characterwhose name is very similar to Watson'swere originally intended to work together much as Holmes and Watson do; in his view, House's diagnostic team has assumed that aspect of the Watson role.[18] Shore said that House's name itself is meant as "a subtle homage" to Holmes.[8][19] House's building number is 221B, a direct reference to Holmes's street address.[9]Individual episodes of the series contain additional references to the Sherlock Holmes tales. The main patient in the pilot episode is named Rebecca Adler after Irene Adler, a character in the first Holmes short story, "A Scandal in Bohemia".[20] In the season two finale, House is shot by a crazed gunman credited as "Moriarty," the name of Holmes's nemesis.[21] In the season four episode "It's a Wonderful Lie," House receives a "second edition Conan Doyle" as a Christmas gift.[22] In the season five episode "The Itch," House is seen picking up his keys and Vicodin from the top of a copy of Conan Doyle's The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes.[23] In another season five episode, "Joy to the World," House, in an attempt to fool his team, uses a book by Joseph Bell, Conan Doyle's inspiration for Sherlock Holmes.[8] The volume had been given to him the previous Christmas by Wilson, who included the message "Greg, made me think of you." Before acknowledging that he gave the book to House, Wilson tells two of the team members that its source was a patient, Irene Adler.[24] The series finale pays homage to Holmes's apparent death in "The Final Problem", the 1893 story with which Conan Doyle originally intended to conclude the Holmes chronicles.[25]House is a co-production of Heel and Toe Films, Shore Z Productions, and Bad Hat Harry Productions in association with Universal Media Studios for Fox.[27] Paul Attanasio and Katie Jacobs, the heads of Heel and Toe Films; David Shore, the head of Shore Z Productions; and Bryan Singer, the head of Bad Hat Harry Productions, have been executive producers of the program since its inception.[12] Lawrence Kaplow, Peter Blake, and Thomas L. Moran joined the staff as writers at the beginning of the first season after the making of the pilot episode. Writers Doris Egan, Sara Hess, Russel Friend, and Garrett Lerner joined the team at the start of season two. Friend and Lerner, who are business partners, had been offered positions when the series launched, but turned the opportunity down. After observing the show's success, they accepted when Jacobs offered them jobs again the following year.[28] Writers Eli Attie and Sean Whitesell joined the show at the start of season four. Since the beginning of season four, Moran, Friend, and Lerner have been credited as executive producers on the series, joining Attanasio, Jacobs, Shore, and Singer.[27] Hugh Laurie was credited as an executive producer for the second[29] and third[30] episodes of season five.Shore is House's showrunner.[31] Through the end of the sixth season, more than two dozen writers have contributed to the program. The most prolific have been Kaplow (18 episodes), Blake (17), Shore (16), Friend (16), Lerner (16), Moran (14), and Egan (13). The show's most prolific directors through its first six seasons were Deran Sarafian (22 episodes), who was not involved in season six, and Greg Yaitanes (17). Of the more than three dozen other directors who have worked on the series, only David Straiton directed as many as 10 episodes through the sixth season. Hugh Laurie directed the seventeenth episode of season six, "Lockdown".[32] Elan Soltes has been the visual effects supervisor since the show began.[33] Lisa Sanders, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, is a technical advisor to the series. She writes the "Diagnosis" column that inspired House's premise.[34] According to Shore, "three different doctors... check everything we do".[35] Bobbin Bergstrom, a registered nurse, is the program's on-set medical adviser.[35]It wasn't a massive move when I first considered [doing House]. What usually happens is you do a pilot and of the very few picked up, only about a quarter go to a second year. So I thought I'll have three fun weeks. I never dreamed I'd be here three and a half years later.At first, the producers were looking for a "quintessentially American person" to play the role of House.[37] Bryan Singer in particular felt there was no way he was going to hire a non-American actor for the role.[10] At the time of the casting session, actor Hugh Laurie was in Namibia filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix. He assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light,[37] and apologized for its appearance[38] (which Singer compared to a "bin Laden video").[39] Laurie improvised, using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the "American actor" was able to grasp the character.[10][40] Singer was not aware that Laurie was English, due to his convincing American accent. Laurie credits the accent to "a misspent youth [watching] too much TV and too many movies".[37] Although locally better-known actors such as Denis Leary, David Cross, Rob Morrow, and Patrick Dempsey were considered for the part, Shore, Jacobs, and Attanasio were as impressed as Singer and cast Laurie as House.[41]Laurie later revealed that he initially thought the show's central character was Dr. James Wilson. He assumed that House was a supporting part, due to the nature of the character, until he received the full script of the pilot episode.[42] Laurie, the son of a doctor, Ran Laurie, said he felt guilty for "being paid more to become a fake version of [his] own father".[37] From the start of season three, he was being paid $275,000 to $300,000 per episode, as much as three times what he had previously been making on the series.[43][44] By the show's fifth season, Laurie was earning around $400,000 per episode, making him one of the highest paid actors on network television.[45]Robert Sean Leonard had received the script for the CBS show Numb3rs, as well as that for House.[46] Leonard thought the Numb3rs script was "kind of cool" and planned to audition for the show.[46] However, he decided that the character he was up for, Charlie Eppes, was in too many scenes; he later observed, "The less I work, the happier I am".[46] He believed that his House audition was not particularly good, but that his lengthy friendship with Singer helped win him the part of Dr. Wilson.[46] Singer had enjoyed Lisa Edelstein's portrayal of a prostitute on The West Wing, and sent her a copy of the pilot script.[47] Edelstein was attracted to the quality of the writing and her character's "snappy dialogue" with House, and was cast as Dr. Lisa Cuddy.[47]Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent suggested that he audition for the role of Dr. Robert Chase. Spencer believed the program would be similar in style to General Hospital, but changed his mind after reading the scripts.[48] After he was cast, he persuaded the producers to turn the character into an Australian.[49] Patrick Dempsey also auditioned for the part of Chase; he later became known for his portrayal of Dr. Derek Shepherd on Grey's Anatomy.[50] Omar Epps, who plays Dr. Eric Foreman, was inspired by his earlier portrayal of a troubled intern on the NBC medical drama ER.[51] Jennifer Morrison felt that her audition for the part of Dr. Allison Cameron was a complete disaster.[52] However, before her audition, Singer had watched some of her performances, including on Dawson's Creek, and already wanted to cast her in the role.[52] Morrison left the show when her character was written out in the middle of season six.[53]At the end of season three, House dismisses Chase, while Foreman and Cameron resign.[54] House must then recruit a new diagnostic team, for which he identifies seven finalists. The producers originally planned to recruit two new full-time actors, with Foreman, who returns in season four's fifth episode, bringing the team back up to three members; ultimately, the decision was made to add three new regular cast members.[55] (Along with Epps, actors Morrison and Spencer remained in the cast, as their characters moved on to new assignments.) During production, the show's writers dismissed a single candidate per episode; as a result, said Jacobs, neither the producers nor the cast knew who was going to be hired until the last minute.[56] In the season's ninth episode, House's new team is revealed: Foreman is joined by doctors Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn),[57] Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson),[58] and Remy "Thirteen" Hadley (Olivia Wilde).[59] The candidates rejected by House have not returned to the show, with the exception of the last one cut: Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek), who appeared for the rest of season four as Wilson's girlfriend,[60] and in season five as a hallucination of House's.[61] While Penn and Wilde had higher profiles than the actors who played the other finalists, Jacobs said they went through an identical audition process and stayed with the show based on the writers' interest in their characters.[56] Kutner was written out of the series near the end of season five after Penn took a position in the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs.[62]The contracts of Edelstein, Epps, and Leonard expired at the end of season seven. As a cost-cutting measure, the three actors were asked to accept reduced salaries. Epps and Leonard came to terms with the producers, but Edelstein did not, and in May 2011 it was announced that she would not be returning for the show's eighth season.[63]House is often filmed using the "walk and talk" filming technique,[6][17] popularized on television by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, Sports Night, and The West Wing.[64] The technique involves the use of tracking shots, showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking.[64] Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because "when you put a scene on the move, it's a... way of creating an urgency and an intensity".[6] She noted the significance of "the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6'2" and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop".[6] Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker described the show's "cool, 'Fantastic Voyage'like special effects of patients' innards. I'll bet you didn't know that when your kidneys shut down they sound like bubble wrap popping."[65] "Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat" of one patient, another critic observed, "but up her nose and inside her brain and leg".[66] Instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery, the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography.[33] Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise, revealing aspects of his character and the story.[6]The pilot episode was filmed in Canada; primary photography for all subsequent episodes has been shot on the Fox lot in Century City.[35] Bryan Singer chose the hospital near his hometown, West Windsor, New Jersey, as the show's fictional setting.[12] Princeton University's Frist Campus Center[a] is the source of the aerial views of PrincetonPlainsboro Teaching Hospital seen in the series.[67] Some filming took place at the University of Southern California for the season three episode "Half-Wit", which guest-starred Dave Matthews and Kurtwood Smith.[68] Part of House's sixth season was filmed at the abandoned Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital, in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, as the fictional Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital.[69]The opening sequence begins with an MRI of a head with an image of the boxed "H" from the logo (the international symbol for hospital) in the foreground. This is then overlaid with an image of Dr. House's face taken from the pilot episode with the show's full title appearing across his face. House's head then fades and the show's title is underlined and has the "M.D." appear next to it, producing the entire logo of the show. This was the full extent of the title sequence in the pilot episode.[70] All subsequent episodes contain a longer sequence including the names of the six featured cast members and creator David Shore. Laurie's name appears first, followed by the names of the five other featured cast members in alphabetical order (Edelstein, Epps, Leonard, Morrison, Spencer, then Shore).[71]After the show's title fades, there is an aerial view of PPTH (actually various Princeton University buildings, primarily Frist Campus Center).[67] This is followed by a series of images accompanying each cast member's name; most are shown next to, or superimposed upon, illustrations of the human anatomy. Laurie's name appears next to a model of a human head with the brain exposed; Edelstein's name appears next to a visual effectsproduced graphic of nerve axons; Epps's name is superimposed upon a rib cage X-ray; Leonard's name appears on a drawing of the two hemispheres of the brain.[71] The producers originally wanted to include an image of a cane and an image of a Vicodin bottle, but Fox objected. Morrison's title card was thus lacking an image; an aerial shot of rowers on Princeton University's Lake Carnegie was finally agreed upon to accompany her name.[72] Spencer's name appears next to an old-fashioned anatomical drawing of a spine. Between the presentations of Spencer's and Shore's names is a scene of House and his three original team members walking down one of the hospital's hallways.[71] Jacobs said that most of the backgrounds have no specific meaning; however, the final imagethe text "created by David Shore" superimposed upon a human neckconnotes that Shore is "the brain of the show".[72] The sequence was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design in 2005.[73] The title sequence continued to credit Spencer and Morrison, even when their characters were reduced to background roles during seasons four and five, and Morrison even after hers was written out. A new opening sequence was introduced in season seven to accommodate the changes in the cast, removing Morrison's name and including Jacobson and Wilde's.[74][75]The series' original opening theme, as heard in the United States, comprises instrumental portions of "Teardrop" by Massive Attack.[76][77] An acoustic version of "Teardrop", with guitar and vocals by Jos Gonzlez, is heard as background music during the season four finale.[78]Anytime you try to summarize a show in one word, you sound like an ass. It's about truth.Gregory House, M.D., often construed as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey.[70] Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a pre-credits scene set outside the hospital, showing events ending with the onset of the patient's symptoms.[17] The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness,[76][80] which often fail until the patient's condition is critical.[76] They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed,[67] and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting.[17] The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices,[dubious  discuss] and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.[3]The team employs the differential diagnosis method,[80] listing possible etiologies on a whiteboard, then eliminating most of them, usually because one of the team (most often House) provides logical reasons for ruling them out.[81] Typically the patient is misdiagnosed at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless;[80] this usually causes further complications, butas the nature of the complications often provides valuable new evidenceeventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly.[17] House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character.[80] Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases.[82]The team face many diagnostic difficulties from patients' concealment of symptoms, circumstances, or personal histories, so House frequently proclaims during the team's deliberations, "The patient is lying", or mutters "Everybody lies"; such an assumption guides House's decisions and diagnoses,[9] and makes the countermeasure of housebreaking a routine procedure. Because many of his hypotheses are based on epiphanies or controversial insights, he often has trouble obtaining permission for medical procedures he considers necessary from his superior, who in all but the final season is hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy.[83] This is especially the case when the proposed procedures involve a high degree of risk or are ethically questionable. There are frequent disagreements between House and his team,[84] especially Dr. Allison Cameron, whose standards of medical ethics are more conservative than those of the other characters.[76]Like all of the hospital's doctors, House is required to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic.[70][85] His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief.[76][86] During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments.[70] However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses.[15] Analogies with some of the simple cases in the clinic often[dubious  discuss] inspire insights that help solve the team's case.[17][87]It's not a show about addiction, but you can't throw something like this into the mix and not expect it to be noticed and commented on. There have been references to the amount of his consumption increasing over time. It's becoming less and less useful a tool for dealing with his pain, and it's something we're going to continue to deal with, continue to explore.A significant plot element is House's use of Vicodin to manage pain, caused by an infarction in his quadriceps muscle five years before the show's first season, which also forces him to use a cane.[89] In the first season; eleventh episode "Detox", House admits he is addicted to Vicodin, but says he does not have a problem because the pills "let me do my job, and they take away my pain".[b] His addiction has led his colleagues, Cuddy and Dr. James Wilson, to encourage him to go to drug rehabilitation several times.[90] When he has no access to Vicodin or experiences unusually intense pain, he occasionally self-medicates with other narcotic analgesics such as morphine,[91] oxycodone,[92] and methadone.[93] House also frequently drinks liquor when he is not on medical duty, and classifies himself as a "big drinker".[94] Toward the end of season five, House begins to hallucinate; after eliminating other possible diagnoses, he and Wilson determine that his Vicodin addiction is the most likely cause.[95] House goes into denial about this for a brief time, but at the close of the season finale, he commits himself to Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital.[96] In the following season's debut episode, House leaves Mayfield with his addiction under control.[97] However, about a year and a half later, in season seven's 15th episode, "Bombshells", House reacts to the news that Cuddy possibly has kidney cancer by taking Vicodin,[98] and his addiction recurs.[99]Throughout House's run, six of the main actors have received star billing. All of them play doctors who work at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey.[70] Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), the title character, heads the Department of Diagnostic Medicine.[106] House describes himself as "a board-certified diagnostician with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology".[107] Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), House's one true friend, is the head of the Department of Oncology.[108] Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), an endocrinologist,[109] is House's boss, as she is the hospital's dean of medicine and chief administrator.[110] House has a complex relationship with Cuddy, and their interactions often involve a high degree of innuendo and sexual tension.[111] In the sixth episode of season five, "Joy", they kiss for the first time.[112] Their physical relationship does not progress any further during the fifth season; in the finale, House believes he and Cuddy had sex, but this is a hallucination brought on by House's Vicodin addiction.[96] In the finale of season six, Cuddy tells House she loves him. They kiss and agree to try being a couple.[113] Throughout season seven, House and Cuddy try to make their relationship work.House's original team of diagnosticians consists of Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), a neurologist; Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), an intensivist; and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), an immunologist.[110] In the season three episode "Family", Foreman announces his resignation, telling House, "I don't want to turn into you".[c] During the season finale, House tells Chase that he has either learned everything he can, or nothing at all, and dismisses him from the team. Cameron, who has developed an affection for Chase, soon resigns.[54] This leaves House without a team for the season four premiere.[114]Under orders from Cuddy to recruit a new team, House considers forty doctors.[94] Season four's early episodes focus on his selection process, structured as a reality TVstyle elimination contest[94] (Jacobs referred to it as a "version of Survivor").[115] House assigns each applicant a number between 1 and 40, and pares them down to seven finalists.[116] He assesses their performance in diagnostic cases, assisted by Foreman, who returns to the department after his dismissal from another hospital for House-like behavior.[116][117][118] While Foreman's return means there are only two open slots, House tricks Cuddy into allowing him to hire three new assistants.[119] He ultimately selects Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), a former plastic surgeon; Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn), a sports medicine specialist; and Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley (Olivia Wilde), an internist (nicknamed for her number in the elimination contest).[119][120] In the season finale, Thirteen discovers she has, as she had long dreaded, Huntington's disease, which is incurable.[78]In the eleventh episode of season five, "Joy to the World", Foreman and Thirteen engage in a passionate kiss.[24] Thirteen is at first reluctant to start a relationship with Foreman, but the two eventually begin dating and are still together at the end of the season.[96] They break up early in season six. In the twentieth episode of season 5, "Simple Explanation", Kutner is found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. Because Kutner left no note, House suspects foul play, though the death is accepted by the other characters as a suicide.[121]In the seventh episode of season two, "Hunting", Cameron and Chase have a one-night stand.[122] In the middle of season three, they initiate a sexual relationship that Cameron insists be casual;[109] when Chase declares that he "wants more", Cameron ends the affair.[123] By the end of the season, however, Cameron recognizes that she has romantic feelings for Chase and they begin a serious relationship.[54] After leaving the diagnostic team, they assume different roles at the PPTH, Cameron as a senior attending physician in the emergency room[d] and Chase as a surgeon.[94] They become engaged in the season five episode "Saviors" (the episode immediately following Kutner's suicide)[61] and are married in the season finale.[124] When Chase rejoins House's team in season six, Cameron leaves her husband and the hospital in "Teamwork", the season's eighth episode.[125] She returns as a guest character in "Lockdown", nine episodes later.[126]Early in season seven, Thirteen takes an unexplained leave of absence. Cuddy orders House to fill her position with another woman,[127] but eventually makes the choice for him: medical student Martha M. Masters (Amber Tamblyn), who makes her first appearance in the season's sixth episode.[128] Thirteen returns in the "The Dig"the season's 18th episode and the show's 150thin which the reason for her absence is revealed: she was in prison for six months for having helped euthanize her brother, who was suffering from advanced Huntington's.[129] While Jacobson and Wilde play central characters (as did Penn), they did not receive star billing until season seven. They were credited as "Also Starring", with their names appearing after the opening sequence.[130] In season seven, Jacobson and Wilde received star billing; new regular cast member Tamblyn did not.[131]The first six seasons of House each included one or more recurring featured characters, who appear in multi-episode story arcs.[132] In season one, Edward Vogler (Chi McBride), the billionaire owner of a pharmaceutical company, appears in five episodes.[133] He donates US$100 million to the PPTH in return for chairing its board.[134] Vogler represented an attempt to introduce a villain, a move urged by Fox. By the time the Vogler episodes began to air, the show had become a hit and the character was soon dropped.[133] Shore said the concept of a villainous boss was not really viable for the series: "It's called House. The audience knows he'll never get fired."[9]Stacy Warner (Sela Ward), House's ex-girlfriend,[135] appears in the final two episodes of the first season, and seven episodes of season two.[9] She wants House to treat her husband, Mark Warner (Currie Graham), whom House diagnoses with acute intermittent porphyria in the season one finale.[135] Stacy and House grow close again, but House eventually tells Stacy to go back to Mark, which devastates her.[136]Michael Tritter (David Morse), a police detective, appears in several season three episodes. He tries to extract an apology from House, who left Tritter in an examination room with a thermometer in his rectum.[137] After House refuses to apologize, Tritter brings him up on charges of unprescribed narcotics possession and forces him to attend rehab. When the case reaches court, Cuddy lies for House and the case is dismissed. The judge reprimands Tritter for pursuing House to excess, and tells House that she thinks he "has better friends than he deserves", referring to Cuddy's 11th-hour testimony on his behalf. House is sentenced to one night in jail for contempt of court and finishes his rehabilitation under the influence of Vicodin.[90]The candidates for House's new diagnostics team are season four's primary recurring characters.[138] In addition to the three who are chosen, the other four finalists are Jeffrey Cole (Edi Gathegi); Travis Brennan (Andy Comeau), an epidemiologist;[138] Henry Dobson (Carmen Argenziano), a former medical school admissions officer;[94] and Amber "Cut-throat Bitch" Volakis (Anne Dudek), an interventional radiologist.[120] Each of the four departs the show after elimination, except for Volakis, who appears throughout the season, having started a relationship with Wilson.[139][140] In the two-part season finale, Volakis attempts to shepherd a drunken House home when Wilson is unavailable. They are involved in a bus crash, which leads to her death.[78][141] She reappears late in season five among the hallucinations House suffers.[61]Private investigator Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston), a character inspired in part by Shore's love of The Rockford Files, appears in three episodes of season five.[142][143] House initially hires Douglas to spy on Wilson, who has ended their friendship after Volakis's death (the friendship is subsequently rekindled). House later pays Douglas to look into the private lives of his team members and Cuddy.[144] If the character was accepted by the audience, there were plans to feature him as the lead in a spin-off show.[145] In September 2008, Shore spoke to Entertainment Weekly about his vision for the character: "I don't want to do just another medical show. What does excite me in terms of writing is the choices people make and the nature of right and wrong... and a private investigator can approach that question much more readily than a doctor can."[146] There was no show featuring Douglas on the fall 2009 network television schedule.[147] He returns to House in season six as Cuddy's boyfriend.[148] They are briefly engaged until Cuddy breaks it off, realizing that she is in love with House.[149]House received largely positive reviews on its debut;[150] the series was considered a bright spot amid Fox's schedule, largely filled with reality shows.[151] Matt Roush of TV Guide said that the program was an "uncommon cure for the common medical drama".[152] New York Daily News critic David Bianculli applauded the "high caliber of acting and script".[66] The Onion's "A.V. Club" approvingly described it as the "nastiest" black comedy from FOX since 1996's short-lived Profit.[153] New York's John Leonard called the series "medical TV at its most satisfying and basic",[154] while The Boston Globe's Matthew Gilbert appreciated that the show did not sugarcoat the flaws of the characters to assuage viewers' fears about "HMO factories".[155] Variety's Brian Lowry, less impressed, wrote that the show relied on "by-the-numbers storytelling, albeit in a glossy package".[156] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle described it as "mediocre" and unoriginal.[157]General critical reaction to the character of Gregory House was particularly positive.[150][158] Tom Shales of The Washington Post called him "the most electrifying new main character to hit television in years".[159] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Rob Owen found him "fascinatingly unsympathetic".[160] Critics have compared House to fictional detectives Nero Wolfe,[161] Hercule Poirot, and Adrian Monk,[162] and to Perry Cox, a cantankerous doctor on the television show Scrubs.[151][160] One book-length study of the series finds a powerful kinship between House and another famous TV doctor, Hawkeye Pierce of M*A*S*H.[163] Laurie's performance in the role has been widely praised.[76][161][164] The San Francisco Chronicle's Goodman called him "a wonder to behold" and "about the only reason to watch House".[157] Gabrielle Donnelly of the Daily Mail said that because of Laurie's complex personality, he was "perfectly cast" in the title role.[44]Critics have also reacted positively to the show's original supporting cast, which the Post's Shales called a "first-rate ensemble".[159] Leonard's portrayal of Dr. Wilson has been considered Emmy Award worthy by critics with TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly, and USA Today.[165][166] Bianculli of the Daily News was happy to see Edelstein "finally given a deservedly meaty co-starring role".[66] Freelance critic Daniel Fienberg was disappointed that Leonard and Edelstein have not received more recognition for their performances.[167]Reaction to the major shifts of season four was mixed. "With the new crew in place House takes on a slightly more energized feel", wrote Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk. "And the set up for the fifth season is quite brilliant."[168] The Star-Ledger's Alan Sepinwall wrote, "The extended, enormous job audition gave the writers a chance to reinvigorate the show and fully embrace Laurie's comic genius".[132] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times, on the other hand, took issue with the developments: "the cast just kept getting bigger, the stories more scattered and uneven until you had a bunch of great actors forced to stand around watching Hugh Laurie hold the show together by the sheer force of his will".[169] USA Today's Robert Bianco cheered the season finale: "Talk about saving the best for last. With two fabulous, heartbreaking hours... the writers rescued a season that had seemed diffuse, overcrowded and perhaps too ambitious for its own good."[166]In contrast to the acclaim the series had earlier received, season five of House met with relatively poor notices. A. A. Gill of The Sunday Times felt that the show had "lost its sense of humour".[170] The Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan wrote, "House used to be one of the best shows on TV, but it's gone seriously off the rails".[171] Though McNamara of the Los Angeles Times found detective Lucas Douglas a "delightful addition" to the season's early episodes,[169] Ryan saw him as an "unwelcome distraction... an irritating pipsqueak".[143] The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman came in for particular criticism.[132][172]At the end of the show's run, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote that "House had, in its final seasons, become a rather sentimental show".[173] In New York Magazine's blog Vulture, Margaret Lyons wrote, "More than a hospital drama or a character piece or anything else, House is a complex meditation on misery." But, continued Lyons, there is a line between "enlightened cynicism" and "misery-entropy", and "as the show wore on, its dramatic flare dimmed while its agony flare burned ever brighter."[174] Alan Sepinwall wrote, "The repetition and muck of [the] middle seasons ultimately severed whatever emotional connection I had to House's personal struggles."[25]The show placed #62 on Entertainment Weekly's "New TV Classics" list.[175] The show was declared the second highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002-2012).[176]After its first five seasons, House was included in various critics' top ten lists; these are listed below in order of rank.Since its premiere, House has been consistently popular. In its first season, when it ranked twenty-fourth among all television series, House was the ninth most popular primetime program among women.[182] Aided by a lead-in from the widely popular American Idol,[183] the following three seasons of the program each ranked in the top ten among all viewers. House reached its peak Nielsen ratings in its third season, attracting an average of 19.4 million viewers per episode.[184] According to Jacobs, the production team was surprised that the show garnered such a large audience.[185] In its fifth season, the show attracted 12.0 million viewers per episode and slipped to nineteenth place overall. It remained Fox's most popular show other than American Idol.[186]The most-watched episode of House is the season four episode "Frozen",[187] which aired after Super Bowl XLII.[188][189] It attracted slightly more than 29 million viewers.[190] House ranked third for the week, equalling the rating of American Idol and surpassed only by the Super Bowl itself and the post-game show.[191] Below is a table of House's seasonal rankings in the U.S. television market, based on average total viewers per episode. Each U.S. network television season starts in September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.House has redefined the medical television show. No longer a world where an idealized doctor has all the answers or a hospital where gurneys race down the hallways, House's focus is on the pharmacologicaland the intellectual demands of being a doctor. The trial-and-error of new medicine skillfully expands the show beyond the format of a classic procedural, and at the show's heart, a brilliant but flawed physician is doling out the prescriptionsa fitting symbol for modern medicine.House has received many awards and award nominations. In 2005, 2007, and 2008, Laurie was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.[202] The Emmy board also nominated House for Outstanding Drama Series in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, but the show has yet to win the award.[203] For the season one episode "Three Stories", David Shore won a writing Emmy in 2005[73][204] and the Humanitas Prize in 2006.[205] Director Greg Yaitanes received the 2008 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing - Drama Series, for directing "House's Head", the first part of season four's two-episode finale.[206]The show has been nominated for six Golden Globe Awards and received two. Hugh Laurie has been nominated four times for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Drama; he won in 2006[207][208] and again in 2007.[209][210] In 2008 the series received its first nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series - Drama.[211] House was nominated for best dramatic series again the following year, but has yet to win in the category.[212]The show received a 2005 Peabody Award for what the Peabody board called an "unorthodox lead charactera misanthropic diagnostician" and for "cases fit for a medical Sherlock Holmes", which helped make House "the most distinctive new doctor drama in a decade".[213] The American Film Institute (AFI), included House in its 2005 list of 10 Television Programs of the Year.[201]In 2011, House won four People's Choice Awards: favorite TV drama; favorite dramatic actor and actress for Laurie and Edelstein; and favorite TV doctor.[214]Laurie won the Screen Actors Guild's award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series in both 2007 and 2009.[215] Writer Lawrence Kaplow won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2006 for the season two episode "Autopsy".[216] In 2007, the show won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for prosthetic makeup.[217]In 2005, Laurie appeared on the cover of TV Guide as "TV's Sexiest Man".[182] In 2008, Gregory House was voted second sexiest television doctor ever, behind ER's Doug Ross (George Clooney).[44][218]In 2008, House was distributed in a total of 66 countries. With an audience of over 81.8 million worldwide, it was the most watched television show on the globe and far surpassed the viewership figures of the leading TV dramas the previous two years (CSI and CSI: Miami).[219][220] The following year, it placed second in the world after CSI.[221]House episodes premiere on Fox in the United States and Global in Canada, which have identical schedules.[222] The show was the third most popular on Canadian television in 2008.[223] That same year, House was the top-rated television program in Germany,[224] the number 2 show in Italy,[225] and number 3 in the Czech Republic.[226] The series is also very popular in France,[227] Spain,[228] Sweden, and the Netherlands.[229] In the United Kingdom, the first four seasons were broadcast on Five. Sky1 acquired first-run rights beginning with season five.[230] The original, English-language version of the show also airs in Australia on Network Ten,[231] in New Zealand on TV3,[232] and in Ireland on 3e, TV3's cable channel.[233]Episodes of the show are also available online for download: Amazon Video on Demand, iTunes Store and the Zune Marketplace offer episodes from all of seasons 1 through 6, with episodes from the current season (season 7)[citation needed] appearing one week after they air live on television.[234] In 2007, NBC Universal (the show's distributor) and Apple Inc. (iTunes' owner) had a disagreement that temporarily kept the fourth season off iTunes.[235] In a statement to the press, Apple claimed that NBC Universal wanted to drive up the per-episode price to $4.99.[236] In September 2008, it was reported that the issue between Apple and NBC had been resolved.[237] Episodes can now also be purchased in HD on iTunes for $2.99.[238] Recent episodes are available in streaming video on Fox's official House webpage[239] and on Hulu.com.[240]The first seven seasons of the show were released on DVD encoded for regions 1, 2 and 4. A boxed set comprising seasons one through seven has been issued, as well.[241] Universal Studios Home Entertainment announced plans to rerelease the first season in region 1 in anamorphic widescreen (the original release is letterboxed).[242] It is unclear if the DVDs will be re-released with anamorphic widescreen in regions 2 and 4, where they have been presented in 4:3 fullscreen.[243][244]For a charity auction, T-shirts bearing the phrase "Everybody Lies" were sold for a limited time starting on April 23, 2007, on Housecharitytees.com. Proceeds from sales of those shirts and others with the phrase "Normal's Overrated" went to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).[245][246] House cast and crew members also regularly attend fundraisers for NAMI and have featured in ads for the organization that have appeared in Seventeen and Rolling Stone. The show's efforts have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the charity. Jacobs said that through their association with NAMI, they hope to take "some of the stigma off that illness".[247]Nettwerk released the House M.D. Original Television Soundtrack album on September 18, 2007.[248] The soundtrack includes full length versions of songs featured in House and previously unreleased songs especially recorded for the series.[249] In 2008, the Spanish game company Exelweiss designed a cellphone game for the show, which was released in both Spanish and English versions.[250]In June 2009, Legacy Interactive announced a licensing agreement with Universal Pictures Digital Platforms Group (UPDPG) to develop a video game based on the series, in which players step into the roles of House's diagnostic team to deal with five unusual medical cases.[251] The game, released in May 2010, included a minigame calling upon the player to "navigat[e] a restaurant-placemat-style maze, in which a giant sandwich must avoid hungry physicians on its way to Dr. House's office." It received an F from The A.V. Club,[252] however Legacy had updated the game by August 2010.[252]House at TV.com  1 Production

Ironhide is the name of several different fictional characters in the Transformers universes. According to the original creator of the Transformers names, Bob Budiansky, Ironhide was named after the television series Ironside.Ironhide (Rhino in Canada, Falco in Italy, Vaskl (Ironfist) in Hungary, Bronevik in Russia) is portrayed as a toughened old Autobot who has seen his share of battle.Ironhide was one of the favorite Autobots of IGN.[1]Ironhide's first appearance is in the comics resembled his toy but was soon updated to his more anthropomorphic animated form. In US Transformers #4, with the Autobots low on fuel and facing an imminent Decepticon assault, he was chosen by Optimus Prime alongside Huffer, Bluestreak and Mirage to be given all the remaining fuel and stand against the Decepticons. While Megatron's soldiers collapsed at the last moment due to poisoned fuel, the Autobots were abruptly offlined and the Ark captured by Shockwave.Once reactivated, he was part of the team sent on a failed mission to prevent the Decepticons contacting Cybertron and battled the Constructicons for the first time.He later worked alongside Jetfire in the Dinobot Hunt and learned to trust him despite his Decepticon origins; and he fought the Constructicons again at a demolition derby while working as a bodyguard for Buster Witwicky. Things took a darker turn when, in Target: 2006, Galvatron arrived and Optimus Prime was sent to Limbo. Losing to the future Decepticon and having taken a humiliating beating, it was Ironhide who made the decision to dig up & reactivate Megatron and have him assume command against Galvatron.Ironhide was sidelined as a character in subsequent issues, though he was drawn as fighting against Ratbat's forces on the moon and in the Time Wars.He was later deactivated, presumably during the Underbase battle, and reactivated by Grimlock using nucleon.In the latter-day black-and-white U.K. stories, he was one of five Autobots who Galvatron accidentally reactivated whilst trying to find Autobots with flaws that he could exploit to gain as troops. It was revealed Ironhide had once thwarted a terrorist siege only for the police to almost mess it up, leaving him feeling frustrated with humans. The five defeated him and Ironhide became part of the Autobot Earthforce, where he went on to thwart Decepticon attempts to create an Actionmaster Devastator and help Jazz prevent Megatron & Shockwave from uniting their two factions.Ironhide appeared in the Marvel Generation Two comics in his Generation 1 form, seemingly dying alongside Smokescreen.The character designers for the cartoon redesigned Ironhide's body, which is now the best-known of all his appearances. He was originally depicted as being a black 72' GMC. Despite being known for being part of the Autobot security detail and Optimus Prime's bodyguard, Ironhide was most often seen in the capacity of a warrior, often fighting in battle without Optimus Prime, or a specific work site/person/cargo to protect. He was also used as an officer, leading a team of Autobots just as would Optimus's advisers, Prowl and Jazz. Ironhide seemed to develop a bond with the Autobots' human allies, engaging with them on a friendly basis as much as protecting them. Ironhide was in love with the female Autobot Chromia.In the "More Than Meets The Eye" three parter that launched the animated series, Ironhide was shown assisting Bumblebee in stopping a Rumble created flood. Later, tired of being constantly a step behind the Decepticons, Ironhide impetuously took off after them - only to be brought back down to Earth with a bump by a teleporting Skywarp. Ironhide's most prominent appearance was in the second season episode The Immobilizer. Distracted by Spike's friend Carly (who was a big fan of the Autobots) while on guard duty, Ironhide inadvertently allowed the Decepticons to steal Wheeljack's latest invention - a weapon that could freeze anything it fired at, including Transformers. Guilt-ridden and believing himself to be too old to be of any further use, Ironhide resigned from active service, against the wishes of Optimus Prime. However, when Carly was captured by the Decepticons trying to make up for what had happened to Ironhide, the veteran Autobot went to her rescue and saved her from the Decepticon base. After being frozen and unfrozen by the Immobilizer (after Carly and Brawn sabotaged it) Ironhide personally destroyed the device and returned to active duty.Ironhide fulfilled his role as Prime's bodyguard in the episode "Transport to Oblivion." While battling Megatron at a power plant, Prime accidentally knocked the Decepticon leader into a generator, giving him a temporary "power boost." Megatron took advantage of the boost, knocking Prime down and temporarily stunning him. He then transformed into his gun mode, ordering Soundwave to destroy the Autobot leader. Ironhide, leaping forward, took the shot himself, saving Prime's life. Rather than pursue the withdrawing Decepticons, Optimus ordered the team back to base because of how badly Ironhide had been hit. The grouchy Ironhide was not at all pleased with needing some "R&R" (what Ratchet said was needed for one of his components--"removed and rebuilt"). Ratchet humorously threatened to disconnect Ironhide's vocal circuits if he kept complaining. Ironhide made a full recovery and was available for duty soon thereafter.In "A Prime Problem", Ironhide took temporary leadership of the Autobots when they could not decide on which Optimus Prime was which, as Megatron had made a perfect clone of Optimus Prime to fool the Autobots into venturing down into a dangerous chasm.In "The Search for Alpha Trion", when Optimus Prime returned to Cybertron alone to save Elita One, Ironhide leads Inferno and Powerglide after him. On Cybertron the Autobots are briefly reunited with Chromia, Moonracer and Firestar to defeat the Decepticons.Ironhide is killed in The Transformers: The Movie as the Decepticons invade an Autobot shuttle in which Ironhide, Prowl, Ratchet and Brawn are traveling to Earth. Before the shuttle departed, Spike asked Ironhide to tell his son, Daniel, that he misses him, and that he will be coming home as soon as they 'kick Megatron's tail clear across the galaxy.' Despite his "heavily concentrated armor in his front section", he falls as result of a number of blasts from the invading Decepticons and several shots to the chest from Megatron in his 'gun' mode, wielded by Starscream. When Megatron reveals to Starscream how he is going to attack Autobot City on Earth and wipe them out forever, a wounded Ironhide clutches at Megatron's leg and yells, "No!!". Megatron answers with the famous words: "Such heroic nonsense", and kills Ironhide offscreen with a point-blank blast to the head from his fusion cannon. A few scenes later, Ironhide appears to be attacking Autobot City with the Decepticons, but this is actually a mis-colored Reflector.Ironhide was featured in the 1985 audio adventures Megatron's Fight For Power, Autobots Fight Back and Laserbeak's Fury by John Grant, published by Ladybird Books.[2][3]The Beast Wars Ironhide made appearance in Transformers: Universe #3 as part of Magnaboss. In this comic Optimus Primal pleads with Magnaboss and the Maximal High council (which oddly includes Bantor, Air Hammer, Corahda, Torca and Battle Unicorn) to take the threat of Unicron seriously, but they doubt his claims. Optimus Primal is detained, but Snarl breaks him out of the detention center.Ironhide spent his peacetime years as a construction engineer fashioning the vast bridges that connect Cybertron's many city-states. When civil war broke out on the planet Cybertron between the Autobots and Decepticon factions, Ironhide joined the Autobot cause.In the War Within stories, Ironhide was shown during the war often teamed with Grimlock. Ironhide was present under Grimlock's at the battle of Altihex, where they proved unable to save the city. When new leader Optimus ordered the evacuation of Cybertron by the Autobots, Ironhide was among those who reluctantly prepared for the evacuation; he was subsequently part of Grimlock's team sent to rescue Optimus in Cybertron's depths and fought to stop Starscream from mechaforming the planet. When Megatron and Optimus Prime temporarily disappeared in an accident with a space bridge and both sides split into multiple factions, Ironhide joined the Lightning Strike Coalition under Grimlock. Working with the LSC, he helped steal a shipment of energon from Starscream at the Moon Alpha Space Port. It is worth noting that this Cybertronian incarnation of Ironhide represented the original toy closely, with his windscreen in front of his face.Ironhide was among the Autobots on the Ark mission, who crashed on Earth and were awoken, reformatted into Earth forms, in 1984. After the Decepticons were defeated, the Autobots returned home in the Ark II, but the ship exploded shortly after takeoff and a deactivated Ironhide was one of those lost in the ocean. He was also one of those recovered by Lazarus and reprogrammed as slave war machines to be sold to the highest bidder. Megatron broke free and then freed his fellow Decepticons; the captured Autobots were abused, but eventually freed by Optimus Prime.In 2003, a Cybertronian task force under Shockwave announced that the war had ended on Cybertron and that Megatron and Optimus Prime's troops were all criminals for their violent acts. Ironhide was taken back to Cybertron, and after Shockwave was deposed he helped Prowl give combat training to the younger Cybertronian Autobots.In this alternate-continuity crossover between Transformers and G.I. Joe, the Ark was discovered by the terrorist group Cobra, and all the Transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles remotely controlled by Tele-Vipers (Cobra's communications officers). In this storyline, Ironhide turned into a Cobra HISS (HIgh Speed Sentry) tank.Ironhide appeared in the second Devil's Due comic series, this time reformatted by Teletran-3 into a 1970s car and also in the third crossover, where he was part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe force that attempted to rescue Optimus Prime. Although his alternate mode is not shown, his body resembles that of the classic G1 look, indicating his alternate mode is now the familiar Nissan.A remold of the Energon Autobot Tow-Line, the original Ironhide makes his first appearance as a new toy in ten years as a BotCon exclusive. His body has been reconfigured by Optimus Prime and the Matrix into a form resembling a more advanced version of his old body. In the accompanying comic, Descent into Evil, set in a possible future he leads a group of Autobots, including his old friend Ratchet. Sent to investigate Deathsaurus' activities, they discovered his plan to create a massive army of Insecticon clones. After his team had been captured Ironhide took on Deathsaurus himself, hoping to distract him long enough to allow Ratchet to free the others. He failed and was captured by the larger Decepticon. However, he and Ratchet were freed by Ricochet, who was in fact an agent of Bumblebee, and had infected the Insecticons with a virus that slowly destroyed their clones. Ironhide was then instrumental in leading Autobot reinforcements to victory over the Decepticons.At the command of Megatron a human city was attacked by Dirge, Ramjet and Thrust. The city was defended by Ironhide, Jetfire, Optimus Prime and Sunstreaker.[4]Ironhide is among the Autobots present when Megatron attacks Iacon with his new weapon, Devastator.[5]In IDW Publishing's new The Transformers: Infiltration mini-series, Ironhide is part of an infiltration unit consisting of Ratchet, Wheeljack, Jazz, Bumblebee and Sunstreaker, led by Prowl. He first appears saving Ratchet from Thundercracker. He was also part of the expedition to the Decepticon base to watch the duel between Megatron and a super-powered Starscream. It is interesting to note here that it is Ironhide, not Prowl (who is in command) or Ratchet (who was arguing for it) who takes the decision to call in Optimus Prime. Although presented as Generation 1's Ironhide, he and Ratchet are shown transforming into full-sized Dodge/Freightliner/Mercedes Benz Sprinter vans, as opposed to the Japanese-manufactured vanettes.In the sequel series The Transformers: Escalation, Ironhide was dispatched along with Sunstreaker to escort the humans back to their homes. Unfortunately, Sunsteaker was attacked by the Machination, an organization dedicated to acquiring Transformer technology, and apparently destroyed as Ironhide tried to get to him. Forced to back off as the humans recovered his remains, Ironhide took Verity and Jimmy back to base. Later he suggested to Prime that he be allowed to look for Sunstreaker, but was overruled - leading to a confrontation with Prowl. After discovering that Ratchet, Verity and Jimmy planned to disobey orders again, Ironhide insisted on going with them. Locating the garage that had built the fake Sunstreaker, Ironhide was talked into letting Verity and Jimmy go in to have a look. When they failed to reappear, Ironhide went in personally - only to discover their gassed bodies, as a timer ticked down past three minutes. Ironhide and Ratchet managed to get the humans to safety, but Ironhide was too slow escaping, and was seemingly destroyed in the blast.Ironhide did not feature prominently in the following instalment, The Transformers: Devastation, but his wreck was rescued from a junkyard by Hot Rod, Wheeljack and Hardhead.Ironhide was shown in the second volume of the Beast Wars: The Ascending miniseries to be part of the Maximal Imperium along with Silverbolt and Prowl. With civil unrest on Cybertron reaching a peak they called in Big Convoy to find out why.Ironhide had a biography printed in the Beast Wars Sourcebook by IDW Publishing.[6]An alternate version of Ironhide would appear in IDW's Hearts of Steel. When Starscream's plan is discovered Ironhide was one of those who followed Bumblebee's lead in following the Decepticon train convoy, shooting down Scourge, and was present at their defeat. Following this, he and the other Autobots went back into stasis.Ironhide was among the Autobots who opposed the Decepticons seving the elder gods in the IDW Publishing Infestation 2: Transformers comic.[7]Ironhide appears in the 2010 video game Transformers: War for Cybertron. Voiced by Keith Szarabajka.Ironhide and Ratchet appear in the 2010 Nintendo DS video game Transformers: War for Cybertron - Autobots. They are unlocked as player characters upon completing the Retaking Iacon mission. He also appears in the video games for both live-action films as a playable character.Ironhide is among the characters who appear in the TRANSFORMERS CVBERVERSE Battle Builder Game.[8]Ironhide appears in the Robot Chicken episode "Junk in the Trunk" voiced by Dax Shepard. When Ironhide asks Prowl about Optimus Prime's urinating problems, Prowl answers him by making a joke because he cannot urinate. In this cameo, a modified Robot Masters Optimus Prime was used to portray Ironhide, since the original G1 Ironhide's robot mode bore little resemblance to the cartoon character.Ironhide appears in the TFcon 2012 live script reading prelude comic. In this story he appears on future Cybertron as a Maximal leader and refuses to let Depth Charge go after Protoform X.[9]Optimus Prime, Ironhide and Grimlock are the three Autobot figures available to play in the Monopoly Transformers Collectors Edition game.[16]Ironhide joined the Autobots forces in the final battle of armageddon, and the very end, he is killed by BombshellIronhide is the strongest of the Spy Changers. Usually a peaceful intellectual until he gets pushed to the limit, then stay out of his way. He's an expert in materials transport and carries a shockwave rifle. Like the original this Ironhide has a Southern accent.In the television series, the Spy Changers received little characterization - usually acting in a group to attack or perform whatever mission they had been assigned. Ironhide's best friend was fellow Spy Changer Mirage which was the basis of one particular episode called "Mirage's Betrayal". After an incident where Mirage, fearing collateral damage, allowed the Predacons to get away, the others on the team accused him of failure. A furious Mirage walked out, realizing the Predacons had put a bug on him. Ironhide attempted to talk him out of it, but snapped and punched him when Mirage threatened to join the Predacons (unaware he was just doing it for show). Later, Mirage called the Spy Changers to Megatron's latest weapon, having ostensibly joined the Predacons. He managed to communicate his true intentions to the other Spy Changers, and they destroyed the laser. A guilty Ironhide demanded Mirage hit him to even things out between them - but Mirage simply prodded his friend, claiming they were now even before challenging him to a race back to base.According to the bio given in Dreamwave comics Ironhide was a supporter of the Mini-Cons joining the Autobots, and was joined with an Autobot warrior until he was killed by Terrorsaur. When Terrorsaur was taken by Unicron she was freed but felt an emptiness in her life and now misses him.She is particularly strong and tough for a Mini-Con as well as being very smart. Her main weapon is her machine gun which fires armor piercing rounds.Ironhide is very emotionally needy.[17]Ironhide is a young, reckless Autobot who idolizes Hot Shot. He's a good fighter, but lacks trouble. He most commonly powerlinx with Jetfire, becoming the lower (or upper) half of their combined form. Carries a laser cannon. In vehicular mode, he resembles a cobalt blue, then later green Mercedes-Benz W163Also note that the Japanese name for the Decepticon Demolishor was Ironhide.The youthful, impetuous Ironhide (Roadbuster) is the newest addition to Optimus Prime's team, and is desperate to prove himself to his commanders, particularly his idol, Hot Shot. Indeed, it is not generally the actions Ironhide performs on his own that define his character, but rather the actions taken in his relationships with others, the first such challenging being his partnership with the disagreeable human, Kicker. Neither Ironhide nor Kicker were happy about Optimus Prime's decision to force them together, but despite everything, the two eventually became good friends. Ironhide would also have to deal with the betrayal of Demolishor and the corruption of Scorponok, resulting in an emotional growth that saw him become the object of adoration himself, and leader of his own team. As a matter of fact, he broke the fourth wall when he said "What will happen next after the break? The world will never know" in the episode "Unicron Unleashed". Ironhide transforms into an SUV with roof-mounted cannons, and possesses the Spark of Combination, allowing him to combine with other Transformers. During the battle against Unicron, Ironhide was evolved into a more powerful form by Primus (the cartoons continued to refer to him by his original name, while the toys were released as Energon Ironhide and Roadbuster W in the U.S. and Japan, respectively).Ironhide would also appear in the Dreamwave Productions Energon comic series, where his backstory was expanded on. In the years of the civil war Ironhide was a prisoner of the Decepticons, most notably the sadistic Tidal Wave, who killed other Autobots whenever Ironhide refused his orders, forcing him to make weapons. Before the events of Energon he had come to Earth under the command of Jetfire. However, his past would come to the fore once again in Energon #24 when he was attacked by Tidal Wave - now a Terrorcon, a group of former Decepticons enhanced by Unicron - who threatened Cliffjumper's life to get what he wanted. Forcing Ironhide to take him to a store of planet-destroying warheads to obtain one for the Terrorcons, Tidal Wave underestimated his prisoner's resolve as he activated the warhead and attacked Tidal Wave. The Terrorcon easily defeated him, but was forced to flee by the arrival of Jetfire and the seemingly imminent detonation of the bomb - unaware that Ironhide had rigged it not to go off.He was subsequently on Earth for the arrival of the Omnicons, and was one of the defenders of the Autobot base alongside Overload and Dropshot, but was easily defeated by Scorponok. After Megatron surprisingly arrived and defeated the Terrorcon leader, he confronted Ironhide - but instead of destroying him he merely gave Ironhide a message to give to the Autobots: that Megatron was back.Dreamwave went out of business before the end of Energon could be reached, so any further tales of Ironhide would remain untold.Ironhide appeared in the text story from Fun Publications called "Force of Habit." This story explained where he was during the events of the Cybertron story. Ultra Magnus was the commander of various Autobot ships sent to other planets in search for the Cyber Planet Keys. He also served as captain of the Iron Hope which was crewed by Bonecrusher, Grimlock, Ironhide, Knock Out, Overcast, Prowl, Quickstrike, RipTide, Skyblast, Smokescreen, Swoop, Wreckage and the Sky Scorcher Mini-Con Team.A new version of Ironhide was created for the Transformers: Universe storyline. Oddly, his deco seems to be a homage to Generation 1 Trailbreaker.This character appeared in the 2004 BotCon voice actor play, and was seemingly yet another new Ironhide taken from a parallel dimension to that of the Robots in Disguise fiction.The Voice Actor Drama was written for OFTCC 2004 by Simon Furman, set after the events in the comics. Spy Changers Optimus Prime, Prowl, Ultra Magnus and Ironhide were among those taken from their world via teleportation beam by Unicron and his Decepticon minions. The Autobot forces opposing Unicron attempted to deflect the beam, which left them all trapped on an uninhabited ice-world. The Autobot forces teamed up to overcome the Decepticons led by Reptilion. Presumably the Autobots were then returned to their own worlds.In the 2007 Transformers live action film, Ironhide appears as a modified GMC Topkick C4500 pickup truck, replacing Arcee in the cast list. Peter Cullen, who provided the voices for both Optimus Prime and Ironhide in the original animated series, does not voice Ironhide in the film. In the film, Ironhide is described as being Prime's oldest friend and the weapons specialist of the team. He is a tough soldier who has sustained many injuries. His right eye has a large scar surrounding it. Before arriving on Earth, he sustained a broken ankle. According to the tech specifications of his toy, he was built during the Battle of Tyger Pax and is one of the oldest Autobots. His weapons include an energy rocket launcher on his left arm, a plasma rocket launcher on his right arm. In Dark of the Moon he has two new cannons invented by Que/Wheeljack. Despite his advanced age and extra bulk, Ironhide revealed himself to be an extremely agile and formidable opponent - He managed to helix twist over a screaming woman in the street at high speed while firing both wrist mounted weapons, and was seen engaging and withstanding assaults from Brawl, Starscream, Blackout, Bonecrusher and Crowbar. He is amongst the most powerful Autobots, exceeded only by Optimus Prime, Sentinel Prime and Jetfire.According to an early interview with Michael Bay, Ironhide stands at 26 feet tall,[19] but the scale of his Voyager class toy would suggest he stands closer to 21 feet tall. The official guide to the Transformers video game says he is 22 feet tall. The Transformers U.K. magazine states he stands 22 feet 5inches tall, weighs 3.8 tons and can travel up to 180mph. He has a California license plate number 4PCI382. Ironhide also possesses a retractable faceplate that he activates when he goes into combat to shield himself from injuries.The weapons in Ironhide's CGI model have over 10,000 pieces each. According to an interview with Industrial Light and Magic, Ironhide's guns alone have more pieces than some of the other Transformers in the film (Optimus Prime has 10,108 pieces).[20]The vehicles used for Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz and Ratchet were put on display by GM at the 2007 Detroit River Walk Festival a little over a week before the U.S. release of the film.[21]This back story of the Transformers on ancient Cybertron is told in Transformers: Defiance. In this story, Starscream returns to Cybertron after encountering an enemy scout ship in the Eshems Nebula. After being repaired for minor damage by Ratchet, Starscream and Ironhide report to Optimus Prime and Megatron.[22] Later, the planet is invaded by aliens from the Eshems Nebula and Ironhide is among the defenders in the city of Metrotitan, near the temple at Simfur. When Megatron forms the Decepticons, Ironhide leaves most of his fellow warriors to join Optimus Prime instead, as he refuses to destroy innocents.In Transformers: Alliance The Autobots aided the human soldiers after the battle in Mission City to destroy the Allspark powered machines that were created. Ironhide destroyed the "Y-Box" and Ratchet killed the Dewbot. After Ratchet finished repairing Bumblebee's legs, a trailer was obtained for Optimus Prime to carry the remains of Jazz. The Autobots then left Mission City before the Sector-7 personnel arrived to claim the remains of the Decepticons. About a month later Epps and Lennox contacted Optimus Prime, Ratchet and Ironhide about aiding them in escorting the remains of the Decepticons to the naval yard, but they were spied on by Barricade, who transmitted the information to Starscream. In issue #4 Fracture was hunted down by Ironhide and human members of N.E.S.T., who chased her until Ironhide could run her off a cliff, killing her.[23]In California the Autobots set a trap for Starscream's minions Divebomb, Fearswoop and Skystalker by having Theodore Galloway pose as an arms dealer attempting to purchase Cybertronian technology. The trap is uncovered and the Autobots send in Arcee, Chromia, Elita-One, Ironhide, Mudflap and Skids. Divebomb and Skystalker are killed while Fearswoop is captured by the Autobots and taken back to the NEST base on Diego Garcia.[24]Note: Events occurring in the alternate universe where Megatron won the battle of Mission City are in italics.The Titan Transformers U.K. Magazine would reveal Ironhide's role in the departure of the Allspark from Cybertron. When it was jettisoned into space he, Ratchet and Jazz hit the pursuing Megatron with a tractor beam, dragging him back to Cybertron. They were no match for his firepower, but the Decepticon leader, realizing they were just stalling him, called in Brawl (Devastator). He proved impervious to their firepower, and seemingly eliminated them all with a foldspace warhead, with Megatron commenting they were lost in space.In the story Lost in Space 3: Ironhide" Ironhide was captured by aliens who were looking for the Allspark. In order to resist the alien mind probe Ironhide remembered a time when he was commanded the Autobots Skyblast, Signal Flare, Strongarm, Bumper and Slipstream against a Decepticon outpost. Discovering the outpost was mostly automated with only one Decepticon, Swindle, the Autobots learned that looks are often deceiving. Ironhide then determined that his alien captors may not be as powerful as they appeared, overcame them, and learned they were merely scavengers who found the ship they used to captures him. He also found a device designed to track the Allspark they had be using.In a later issue, set after the events of the film Ironhide aids the human military in hunting Scorponok.In "Twilight's Last Greaming" part 3 Ironhide and Ratchet sneak into the Decepticon Allspark Power Distribution Hub in Savannah, Georgia disguised as Payload style drones. Although they believe the stolen code they used got them inside safely, once there they are ambushed by Bonecrusher, who says that the code didn't work and he let them in so he could fight them. In part 4 Ratchet and Ironhide continued fighting Bonecrusher in Savannah, but didn't stand much of a chance until they were joined by Arcee, Armoride and Longarm, arriving from the moon.Ironhide appeared in issue #17 of the Titan Transformers Magazine, in a story called "Return to Cybertron Part 1". In this story he is among the Autobots that go to Cybertron.Ironhide would return in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called "The Decepticon who Haunted Himself."Ironhide appeared in the prequel novel Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday. His character is a veteran and longtime friend of Optimus Prime. He is part of Prime's Autobot team searching for the Allspark, and voices the most displeasure at Prime's plan to communicate with the human vessel Ghost-1. With Prime and Bumblebee on the surface, Ironhide and Jazz battle the Decepticons, but Ironhide is put to flight by Starscream's return, only being saved by Ratchet's volley of fire from the Ark. In the final battle, he fights Bonecrusher, delaying him long enough for Prime to get a bead on Starscream, but is unable to stop Starscream from destroying Ghost-1.Ironhide arrives on Earth at the same time as Optimus Prime, Jazz and Ratchet. He scans a GMC Topkick pickup truck and reconfigures his alternate mode to a new camouflaged form before meeting up with the other Autobots at Bumblebee's location. The Autobots then return to Sam's house and retrieve the glasses (containing the location of the Allspark) whilst attempting to hide from Sam's parents, which results in his mother's and father's prized gardens being destroyed by Prime's massive feet and Ratchet cutting off the neighborhood's power after accidentally colliding with an electric transformer. At one point, he becomes so frustrated that he asks Optimus if he can "take them out". He then gets a stern scolding from Optimus, who is frustrated at Ironhide's overuse of cannons. Unfortunately, that same evening a secret government organization, Sector 7, arrests Sam Witwicky, Mikaela Banes, and captures Bumblebee. Ironhide appears somewhat 'trigger-happy' throughout the film, and often pulls out his arm-cannons when he wishes to show off to new people, such as when he is first introduced to Sam, he draws his cannons out, and makes a classic Clint Eastwood impression, quoting "You feeling lucky, punk?", or to get rid of things which annoy him, like Sam's dog Mojo when it urinated on his foot and Sam's over-protective and inadvertently interfering parents. Optimus Prime, at one point, gets so annoyed with Ironhide's trigger finger that he right out asks "What is with you?!". He is also shown to be slightly contemptuous towards the humans; he questions Prime as to why they should protect the human race, describing them as "primitive" and "violent", only to be reminded that the Autobots were not so different from them once. When the Autobots arrive in Mission City Ironhide declares Starscream's arrival by shouting out " It's Starscream!". He is then seen taking cover behind a truck with Bumblebee before being blown away when Starscream fires. Ironhide is, despite being easily the bulkiest of the Autobots, a tough warrior endowed with surprising agility, shown in the final battle when he transforms, flips forward, and dodges Brawl's missiles while doing a helix twist at the same time. He was also able to maneuver through the city, and flip over a nearby human without injuring her, rocket jumping over her right after transforming. Ironhide plays a large role in the final battle: when Bumblebee is unable to fight, he provides cover despite being outnumbered three to one. He battles Brawl alongside Jazz and Ratchet. Ratchet and Ironhide cover Sam as he runs to a nearby building to deliver the Allspark to the military. The two cover him from Blackout and Starscream, driving off both, but being disabled by Starscream. In too much pain to continue on, Ironhide orders Sam to "get to the building." After the battle is over, Ironhide brings the remains of his destroyed Autobot brother Jazz to Optimus Prime. Ironhide then gives Captain William Lennox a ride home, and is seen alongside Ratchet, Bumblebee, and Optimus watching the sunset or watching Sam kiss Mikaela at the end of the film.He goes to Shanghai, China, with NEST and is the first Autobot to transform to robot mode to fight the Decepticons. He chased after the giant Decepticon Demolishor and helped in taking him off-balance, and is then seen alongside Optimus Prime when they execute Demolishor, calling him a "'punk-ass Decepticon'".He seems to promoted to Second-In-Command after Jazz's death. Later on, Ironhide is with the Autobots helping Sam escape the forest from Megatron. Still later, he is angered by the arrival of military vehicles to threaten to Autobots, and he and the others are deported by the U.S. government once Ironhide convinces the others to stay as Optimus would want them to. He goes to Egypt, and leads a team to search for Sam along with the Arcee sisters in the village ruins. After locating him he tells Sam to head for the others while he holds back some attacking Decepticons. When the U.S. airforce carpet bombs the village, Ironhide narrowly gets out of the way, dropping his cannons to lighten himself, and survives the battle.Ironhide first appears when he receives a weapons upgrade from Que. Here he also warns Director Mearing that Optimus is in a bad mood after learning of the discovery of the Ark and asks if they checked the ship's crash vault. He is present when Optimus revives Sentinel Prime with the Matrix of Leadership, and appears late in battle when the Autobots escorting Sentinel are attacked by the Dreads. Ironhide rams them in his truck mode and quickly transforms, while the Dreads need a moment to recover. Ironhide and Sideswipe enter a standoff with the two and all four drop their weapons, agreeing to let the Dreads go, but Crankcase throws an explosive spear into Ironhide's shoulder. Sideswipe kicks a gun to Ironhide and shoots Crowbar in the face then throws the spear into Crankcase's mouth, killing them. Ironhide kicks Crankcase's body (on top of a car) into a car repair shop where it explodes and Ironhide comments "class dismissed." Back at NEST HQ, Sentinel Prime reveals to the Autobots and their allies that he had made a deal with Megatron to enslave mankind to bring back Cybertron. While doing so, he shoots Ironhide in the back twice with his cosmic rust-cannon. As Ironhide cringes in his pain, he expresses in shock at what Sentinel has done, and Sentinel responds by relieving him of duty before delivering the fatal shot to the chest. With Bumblebee forced to take cover from Sentinel's attack, Ironhide dies as he disintegrates to dust. However in the end, Optimus avenges Ironhide's death, by executing Sentinel.It is unknown whether or not that Ironhide will return for the fourth film in 2014.Ironhide is shown fighting his rival Bludgeon, and also runs into Mindwipe.In the video game, a conversation between Ironhide and Optimus Prime reveals that Ironhide was, at least partially, responsible for the destruction of a planet - or a moon - named "Kaiba-5". However, Ironhide responds by claiming, "Awww, that hunk of rock was gonna blow up anyway." In the Autobots storyline, he battles and defeats Brawl as revenge for the former killing Jazz. In the Decepticons storyline, he is killed by Blackout.Ironhide is among the playable characters in the 2009 Revenge of the Fallen video game by Activision. In Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Ironhide Is able to play in more missions due to the character select feature.[25]In another Activision game, Transformers:Dark of the Moon:The Game,he is a default playable character. He has the right-hand mounted Autocannon, a Shotgun, and a full-automatic rifle called a Heavy Iron. He faces "Mixmaster", who is destroyed in the movie but appears in the game as a non-playable boss character.All toys of this character are officially licensed from General Motors.A red and black redeco of Ironhide from G1.A new Ironhide has appeared in the Transformers Animated series. Much like the Generation 1 character named Ironhide, he appears to be a recolored version of Ratchet. Due to Cartoon Network online game mistakenly labeling him as a Decepticon, it was speculated that he was the Autobot traitor mentioned by Megatron (however, it was later revealed that Longarm was the traitor). During the flashbacks in the Transformers Animated episode "Autoboot Camp", Ironhide earned his name from his ability to transmutate his body into a nearly-impenetrable metal (similar to the Marvel Comics character Colossus), and was good friends with Wasp.This version of Ironhide is much younger and more mischievous than his Generation 1 incarnation.It should be noted that in the Japanese translation of Animated, as Bulkhead is given the name Ironhide, this character is known as Armorhide in the Japanese version.[46]Ironhide first appeared in the episode "Mission Accomplished." He contacted Ultra Magnus and revealed that the Decepticons had begun an uprising, destroying a Space Bridge in the process. Before he could reveal all the details however, his transmission was cut short. Ironhide briefly reappeared in the season 3 episode, "Transwarped," where he was a member of Rodimus Minor's team, who were trying to protect a Space Bridge from Strika's Team Chaar. During the fight Rodimus ordered Ironhide and Brawn to fall back to the Space Bridge. Unfortunately, they got tripped up by Oil Slick and slashed at by Cyclonus.Ironhide, again, briefly appeared at the end of "Where is thy Sting?" where he found out that Longarm was the traitor. Ironhide was trying to apprehend him when he found a seriously mutilated Ultra Magnus. He asked him first where his hammer was and then asked what happened. All Ultra Magnus could say was "... Shockwave". He was not seen again after this.If a fourth season was made, Ironhide would have replaced Bulkhead as a main character and received an Earth mode similar to his film and G1 incarnations.Ironhide's biography was printed in issue #24 of the Transformers Collectors Club magazine. He is depicted as a likable, fun-loving young Autobot, whose jokes tend to get a little crude.An evil mirror universe version of Ironhide appeared in the Shattered Glass universe. This version of Ironhide works for the evil Optimus Prime.While no toy for this version of Ironhide was ever made, he is designed to look like the Deluxe Universe toy in the original Diaclone color of black.Appears in the novel Transformers: Exodus, and its sequel Transformers: Exiles.Ironhide makes an appearance as a playable character in the 2010 video game Transformers: War for Cybertron.[50] He first appears leading the Autobot forces during the Iacon City battle at the Decagon, and helps Optimus, Bumblebee and Ratchet get inside after tearing apart two brutes. He next appears as alongside Optimus and Warpath in their attempt to free Omega Supreme and clear Cybertron's core of Dark Energon, during which he expresses his disdain for Warpath's overly triggerhappy personality.In the Nintendo DS game Transformers: War for Cybertron - Decepticons Ironhide is unlockable by finding a data disk in one of the bonus levels. He is seen in the new trailer for Transformers: Fall Of Cybertron and is seen punching Starscream in the face when he tries to kill Optimus Prime and Bumblebee and after that he is seen standing with Optimus Prime watching the battle.In the episode "Toxicity", Bulkhead explains to Fowler about the dangers of Tox-En, a toxic form of energon. In his flashback, a Transformer resembling G1 Ironhide is seen dead.It was later said at BotCon 2012 that Ironhide would not appear in the show, but that he might show up in other places.1 Transformers: Generation 1

Psych is an American detective comedy-drama television series created by Steve Franks and broadcast on USA Network. It stars James Roday as Shawn Spencer, a young crime consultant for the Santa Barbara Police Department whose "heightened observational skills"[1] and impressive detective instincts allow him to convince people that he solves cases with psychic abilities. The program also stars Dul Hill as Shawn's best friend and reluctant partner Burton "Gus" Guster, as well as Corbin Bernsen as Shawn's captious father, Henry.The series airs new episodes in the U.S. on Wednesdays at 9PM ET/PT, 9PM CST on USA Network. During the second season, an animated segment was added to the series titled "The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus". Psych debuted on Friday, July 7, 2006, immediately following the fifth season premiere of Monk, and continued to be paired with the series until Monk's conclusion on December 4, 2009. It was the highest-rated U.S. basic cable television premiere of 2006.[2] The sixth season ended on April 11, 2012. It is currently USA Network's longest-running original series on air.[3] On January 10, 2012, USA renewed the series for a seventh season, to include 16 episodes. [4] Psych will begin its seventh season on February 27, 2013.[5]Most episodes begin with a cold open in the form of a flashback to Shawn and Gus's childhood. The flashbacks usually involve Shawn and Gus being taught a lesson by a young Henry Spencer, who wishes that his son would follow in his footsteps and become a law enforcement officer. As a child, Shawn was taught by Henry to hone his powers of observation and deduction, often using games and challenges to test him. Each flashback also sets the theme for the episode.Shawn originally becomes known as a psychic when, after calling in tips on dozens of crime covered on the news, which help the police to close the case, the police become suspicious of his knowledge. The police theorize that such knowledge could only come from the "inside" and they decide to arrest him as a suspect. To avoid being sent to jail, Shawn uses his observational skills to convince the police that he is psychic. The interim police chief warns Shawn that if his "powers" are fake, he will be prosecuted. With no choice but to keep up the act, and having proven himself an effective aid to the police in solving crimes, he establishes a psychic detective agency, Psych, and becomes a consultant to the police. Pretending to have psychic powers allows him to engage in strange and comic behavior as he turns real clues into hunches and otherworldly visitations. He enjoys teasing lifelong friend Gus, a pharmaceutical representative, about Gus's eclectic interests as they drive around in a Toyota Echo nicknamed "the blueberry" solving crimes.Head detective Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson), playfully named "Lassie" by Shawn and Gus, quietly respects Shawn's crime-solving skills but doubts his psychic abilities and is constantly exasperated by his antics. On the contrary, junior detective Juliet "Jules" O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Chief Vick (Kirsten Nelson) are far less antagonistic with O'Hara expressing belief in Shawn's abilities, while Vick is mum on the subject and usually willing to give Shawn the leeway he needs to solve cases. Henry and Shawn have a difficult relationship, but despite this, Henry reluctantly helps Shawn on various occasions.The show uses White Rock, British Columbia, Canada for its Santa Barbara, California setting.[13] Psych also incorporates Vancouver and various locations around the Lower Mainland of British Columbia as a backdrop. Santa Barbara is on a mountainous coastline without bays and just has the few Channel Islands miles offshore. Many of the overlooking helicopter shots and set up shots (in which the exterior of the Santa Barbara Courthouse is shown) are actually filmed in Santa Barbara. The animated segments "The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus" were created by J.J. Sedelmaier Productions, Inc. The music, effects and sound design for "The Big Adventures of Little Shawn and Gus" were created by Fred Weinberg.The theme song for Psych is "I Know You Know" by The Friendly Indians, series creator Steve Franks' band. Some episodes in Seasons 3, 4, 5, and 6 use the extended full-length version of "I Know You Know", but most episodes use the usual, shortened version. In some episodes the theme song is changed, usually as a tie-in to the theme of the episode to come.The Christmas and Hindi-themed variations of the song also include variations on the main titles. In particular, the Hindi and Chinese-themed episodes phonetically translated words into Devanagari and Chinese characters, respectively, in their title sequences. The theme in the Twin Peaks tribute is an almost shot-for-shot recreation of the Twin Peaks theme.Since the series first aired, a pineapple has been a recurring theme, with one visible or with an implied presence in every episode. The pineapple is a major marketing point for items related to the show on the USA website.[15] There is also a website that is dedicated to finding a pineapple or pineapple related object in each episode.[16]Psych scored a 4.51 rating and an average of 6.1 million total viewers at its premiere, which made it the highest rated scripted series premiere on basic cable in 2006 in all key demographics (households, P18-49, P25-54, and total viewers), according to a USA Network press release, quoted from the Futon Critic.[2]From the San Jose Mercury News:From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer:Seasons one through six are available on DVD in Region 1, while seasons one, two, and three are available in Regions 2 and 4.

However, it is really his exceptional observational skills and eidetic memory that allow him to obtain his "visions". He refuses to take anything seriously, though has matured slowly throughout the seasons. He has had romantic tension with Juliet since they met, which led them to start dating in the middle of season 5. In the middle of season 6 he tries to propose to her but finds out he is not ready and Juliet is not ready. At the end of season 6 he moves in with her.Burton "Gus" Guster (Dul Hill) is Shawn's best friend since childhood as well as business partner. He also is a pharmaceuticals salesman. Unlike Shawn, he takes his work very seriously, playing the "straight man" and usually tries to act professionally, yet in later episodes he ends up as invested in jokes and snacks like Shawn. He is famous for his many aliases (usually given to him by Shawn), including "Magic Head", "Lavender Gooms", "Ghee Buttersnaps", and "Control Alt Delete". He is known for being attracted to all types of women, who usually end up as the criminal. He is also known for his super sensitive nose, the "Super Sniffer" or "Super Smeller".Carlton "Lassie" Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) is the head detective for the Santa Barbara Police Department. He is skeptical of Shawn's psychic abilities, and is extremely annoyed by Shawn's comic antics. However, he once secretly confessed to Shawn while drunk that he respects him and because of this he occasionally comes to Psych for help with his more difficult cases.Juliet "Jules" O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) is a junior detective for the Santa Barbara Police Department, and is Lassiter's partner. She joined the SBPD after Lassiter's old partner got transferred in season 1, and was originally a cop in Miami. Throughout the series she and Shawn share constant romantic tension, and the two start dating in season 5.Chief Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson) is the SBPD Chief. She is tough but fair, usually reluctant to hire Shawn and Gus for cases, but almost always gives in. She respects Shawn's help and input but firmly keeps him in check (as much as she can) when he pushes the limits of the law or her patience.Henry Spencer (Corbin Bernsen) is Shawn's uptight and precise father and a former police sergeant. He trained Shawn on everything about being a detective, going so far as teaching him to remember the layout of a room with his eyes closed and beating a lie detector. He is usually visited by Shawn with questions about various cases, but is usually reluctant to help. He has been rehired to the SBPD to be in charge of the department's consultants, much to Shawn's chagrin. At the end of Season 6, Henry quit the SBPD and then was shot by a former police partner after finding out he was being paid to cover up cases for criminals in the season's cliffhanger ending.Young Shawn (Seasons 15: Liam James; Seasons 5present: Skyler Gisondo) is the younger version of Shawn Spencer. He is shown at the beginning of most episodes in flashbacks to the late 1980s and early 1990s, usually learning a life lesson from his father, which helps him later in the episode. He has also been portrayed in various episodes by Josh Hayden and Kyle Pejpar.Young Gus (Carlos McCullers II) is the younger version of Burton "Gus" Guster. He is shown at the beginning of various episodes in flashbacks with Shawn. He was also portrayed by Isaah Brown during the first season.Buzz McNab (Sage Brocklebank) is a naive but lovable cop who often provides Shawn and Gus with clues. He takes every case given him by Lassiter and Juliet with a polite, optimistic attitude, despite both Lassiter and Jules finding said case to be menial. Shawn gives him a "little boy cat" (that is actually a girl cat) that once helped him solve a case in season one. In "Shawn Gets the Yips" (4.05), McNab is severely injured when a bomb went off in his mailbox while he was getting his mail. Later in the episode, he returns to work with a severe concussion and on crutches, but alive; he remarks to Shawn and Gus that he had lost part of three toes, though, and when Shawn coughs from dehydration (he thought that his elliptical trainer was rigged with a bomb and a motivational note written by Jules said if his heart rate got below 150 beats/min he would die), he immediately begins to go get Shawn a drink of water before being told numerous times that he should rest. He has occasionally pulled Shawn over for various traffic violations only to realize that it is him and apologize. In the fourth season finale episode, "Mr. Yin Presents..." (4.16), McNab is attacked and knocked unconscious by the unseen killer, otherwise known as Yin, but survives. He returns in season 5.Madeleine Spencer (Cybill Shepherd) is a police psychologist who is Shawn's mother and Henry's ex-wife. In the episode "Ghosts" (3.01), she tells Lassiter that she has eidetic tonal memory, which is like Shawn's photographic memory but with sound. She appears in "Ghosts" (3.01), "Murder? ... Anyone? ... Anyone? ... Bueller?" (3.02), "An Evening with Mr. Yang" (3.16), and "Yang 3 in 2D" (5.16). She was portrayed over-the-shoulder by a different actress in "Shawn (and Gus) of the Dead" (2.16).Abigail Lytar (Rachael Leigh Cook) is Shawn's high school crush, whom he let get away when he moved from, then back to, Santa Barbara and his parents got divorced. She first appears in "Murder? ... Anyone? ... Anyone? ... Bueller?" (3.02) and returns in "An Evening with Mr. Yang" (3.16), "He Dead" (4.02), "Bollywood Homicide" (4.06), and "You Can't Handle This Episode" (4.10). In "You Can't Handle This Episode", the winter half premiere of Season 4, Abigail departs for Uganda. However, she returns in the episode "Mr. Yin Presents..." (4.16). After being kidnapped by Yin and saved by Shawn, she tells him she does not like danger and breaks up with him after the two share a final kiss.Winnie Guster (Phylicia Rashad) is Gus' mother. She appears in the first two of the series' Christmas episodes, "Gus's Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy" (2.10) and "Christmas Joy" (3.09).Bill Guster (Ernie Hudson, Keith David) is Gus' father. Although the character of Gus' father appeared in the first two Christmas episodes, Bill Guster was played by Ernie Hudson in "Gus's Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy" and by Keith David in "Christmas Joy".Mr. Yang (Ally Sheedy) is a serial killer, first appearing in "An Evening with Mr. Yang" (3.16). She returns after a decade-long absence to target Shawn in her deadly game of cat-and-mouse. In the season four finale, "Mr. Yin Presents..." (4.16), Shawn and Gus visit her in prison. She seems to have a deeper connection to Shawn, as the last scene of "Mr. Yin Presents..." shows Yin, Yang's partner, looking at a picture of what is presumably a younger Yang, standing next to young Shawn. Her help is enlisted again by Shawn and Gus in "Yang 3 in 2D", the fifth season's finale, in which it is revealed that she is actually Yin's daughter.Mary Lightly (Jimmi Simpson) was a department psychologist who was an expert on Mr. Yang. He first appeared in "An Evening with Mr. Yang" (3.16) and later in "Mr. Yin Presents..." (4.16). He was stabbed to death in the season four finale by Yin while bravely trying to capture him alone. He appears on videotape in "Yang 3 in 2D" (5.16) as well.Woody the Coroner (Kurt Fuller) is a police coroner that Shawn shares a mutual respect with. His wife cheats on him with multiple men, some of whom he has approved. He is also apparently wanted in the Philippines. He first appeared in "High Top Fade Out" (4.07).[6]Mr. Yin (Christopher Turner, Peter Weller) was a serial killer who was actually responsible for the Yang murders. He is also Yang's father. He first appeared in "Mr. Yin Presents..." (4.16) targeting Shawn, and later returned for a second round in "Yang 3 in 2D" (5.16), in which he is murdered by his daughter.Pierre Despereaux (Cary Elwes) is an extremely elusive Canadian art thief. He first appeared in "Extradition: British Columbia" (4.01). When Shawn and Gus travel to Canada on a ski trip they end up catching him. However, it is revealed that he, in fact, is simply an insurance fraudster. Despereaux returned in "Extradition II: The Actual Extradition Part" (5.10), in which he was accused of multiple murders after his escape from prison. He was later cleared of the murder charges and finally extradited to the United States. He makes a return in the episode "Indiana Shawn and the Temple of the Kinda Crappy, Rusty Old Dagger" (6.10), in which he races with Shawn and Gus against a gang of art thieves to find an old dagger.Declan Rand (Nestor Carbonell) is a rich criminal profiler so good at his job that he poses a threat to Shawn. He turns out to be a fake criminal profiler and knows that Shawn is not a real psychic. His first appearance was in "Shawn 2.0" (5.08), and his most recent appearance was in "One, Maybe Two, Ways Out" (5.09). In "Extradition II: The Actual Extradition Part" (5.10), Juliet announces that she and Declan broke up.Marlowe Viccellio (Kristy Swanson) is a woman Lassiter meets and becomes romantically involved with. It is later discovered that she has been stealing blood in order to help her dying brother, and she is sent to prison. Despite this, her relationship with Lassiter continues. She first appears in "This Episode Sucks" (6.03) and later in "Let's Doo-Wop It Again" (6.13).Frank O'Hara (William Shatner) is a talented con man who uses his talents to fool the Santa Barbara Police Department. Shawn figured out his schemes, but told him he wouldn't give him up if he mended his relationship with Juliet. Juliet figures it out but he tries to right his wrongs by solving the crime. Juliet is slowly starting to have a better relationship with him. He first appears in "In for a Penny", and again in "Indiana Shawn and the Temple of the Kinda Crappy, Rusty Old Dagger."The theme was given a Christmas theme for the episode "Gus's Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy" (2.10). It was used again in "Christmas Joy" (3.09) and "The Polarizing Express" (5.14).The song was sung in Spanish for "Lights, Camera... Homicidio" (2.13).It was expanded into Bollywood-themed version sung in Hindi in "Bollywood Homicide" (4.06).Boyz II Men performed an a cappella version of the theme for "High Top Fade Out" (4.07). It was used again for the episode "Let's Doo-Wop It Again" (6.13).In the season 5 premiere, "Romeo and Juliet and Juliet" (5.01), the main titles are translated in Chinese. However, the actual theme song itself is not edited.Curt Smith of Tears for Fears guest starred in "Shawn 2.0" (5.08) and recorded his own version of the theme. Smith also recorded a song ("This is Christmas") for the episode "The Polarizing Express" (5.14).[14]Julee Cruise, who recorded the theme for Twin Peaks, recorded a slower, extended version of the theme for the Twin Peaks-inspired episode "Dual Spires" (5.12).A superhero-themed version was recorded for "The Amazing Psych-Man & Tap Man, Issue #2" (6.04). The main titles were also re-done in a comic book style.For the episode "Heeeeere's Lassie" (6.11), the song and main titles were given a theme similar to The Shining.Psych was the winner of the Independent Investigations Group Annual Award for "Excellence in Entertainment" for advancing the cause of science and exposing superstition.

Maryland: Baltimore (Main), Laurel, Columbia, Montgomery CountyThe Johns Hopkins University[4] (informally Johns Hopkins, JHU, or just Hopkins) is a private research university based in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The university was founded on January 22, 1876 and named for its benefactor, the philanthropist Johns Hopkins.[5] Daniel Coit Gilman was inaugurated as the first president on February 22, 1876.[6]Johns Hopkins maintains campuses in Maryland; Washington, D.C.; Italy; China and Singapore. The university is organized into two undergraduate divisions and five graduate divisions on two main campusesthe Homewood campus and the Medical Institutions campusboth located in Baltimore. The university also consists of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, the Peabody Institute, the Carey Business School, and various other facilities.Johns Hopkins pioneered the concept of the modern research university in the United States and has ranked among the world's top such universities throughout its history. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has ranked Johns Hopkins #1 among U.S. academic institutions in total science, medical and engineering research and development spending for 31 consecutive years.[7] As of 2011, thirty-seven Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with Johns Hopkins,[8] and the university's research is among the most cited in the world.[9]On his death in 1873, Johns Hopkins, a Quaker entrepreneur and childless bachelor, bequeathed $7 million (between $140 million to $1.6 billion in 2011 dollars, by varying estimates) to fund a hospital and university in Baltimore, Maryland.[10] At that time this fortune, generated primarily from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,[11] was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States.[12]The first name of philanthropist Johns Hopkins is the surname of his great-grandmother, Margaret Johns, who married Gerard Hopkins. They named their son Johns Hopkins, who named his own son Samuel Hopkins. Samuel named one of his sons after his father and that son would be the university's benefactor.In his 2001 undergraduate commencement address, university president William R. Brody said about the name: "In 1888, just 12 years after the university was founded, Mark Twain wrote about this university in a letter to a friend. He said: 'A few months ago I was told that the Johns Hopkins University had given me a degree. I naturally supposed this constituted me a Member of the Faculty and so I started in to help as I could there. I told them I believed they were perfectly competent to run a college as far as the higher branches of education are concerned, but what they needed was a little help here and there from a practical commercial man. I said the public is sensitive to little things and they wouldn't have full confidence in a college that didn't know how to spell the name John.' More than a century later, we continue to bestow diplomas upon individuals of outstanding capabilities and great talent. And we continue to spell Johns with an s."[13]Milton Eisenhower, a former university president, once spoke at a convention in Pittsburgh where the Master of Ceremonies introduced him as "President of John Hopkins." Eisenhower retorted that he was "glad to be here in Pittburgh."[14]The original board opted for an entirely novel university model dedicated to the discovery of knowledge at an advanced level, extending that of contemporary Germany. Johns Hopkins thereby became the model of the modern research university in the United States. Its success eventually shifted higher education in the United States from a focus on teaching revealed and/or applied knowledge to the scientific discovery of new knowledge. The founders intended the university to be national in scope to strengthen ties across a divided country in the aftermath of the American Civil War. Therefore, the university's official inauguration took on great significance: 1876 was the nation's centennial year and February 22 was George Washington's birthday.The University's viability depended on its first president, Daniel Coit Gilman, recruited from the presidency of the University of California. Gilman launched what many at the time considered an audacious and unprecedented academic experiment to merge teaching and research. He dismissed the idea that the two were mutually exclusive: "The best teachers are usually those who are free, competent and willing to make original researches in the library and the laboratory," he stated. To implement his plan, Gilman recruited internationally known luminaries such as the biologist H. Newell Martin; the physicist Henry A. Rowland (the first president of the American Physical Society), the classical scholars Basil Gildersleeve and Charles D. Morris;[15] the economist Richard T. Ely; and the chemist Ira Remsen, who became the second president of the university in 1901.Gilman focused on the expansion of knowledge, graduate education and support of faculty research. To Gilman, Johns Hopkins existed not for the sake of God, the state, the community, the board, the parents, or even the students, but for knowledge. Faculty who added to such knowledge were rewarded. A complementary focus on graduate education fused advanced scholarship with such professional schools as medicine and engineering. Hopkins became the national trendsetter in doctoral programs and the host for numerous scholarly journals and associations with the founding of the first U.S. university press in 1878.With the completion of Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1889 and the medical school in 1893, the university's researchfocused mode of instruction soon began attracting world-renowned faculty members who would become major figures in the emerging field of academic medicine, including William Osler, William Halsted, Howard Kelly, and William Welch. During this period Hopkins made more history by becoming the first medical school to admit women on an equal basis with men and to require a Bachelors degree, based on the efforts of Mary E. Garrett, who had endowed the school at Gilman's request.In his will and in his instructions to the trustees of the university and the hospital, Hopkins requested that both institutions be built upon the vast grounds of his Baltimore estate, Clifton. When Gilman assumed the presidency, he decided that it would be best to use the university's endowment for recruiting faculty and students, deciding to "build men, not buildings." In his will Hopkins stipulated that none of his endowment should be used for construction; only interest on the principal could be used for this purpose. Unfortunately, stocks in The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which would have generated most of the interest, became virtually worthless soon after Hopkins's death. The university's first home was thus in Downtown Baltimore delaying plans to site the university in Clifton. This decision became the only major criticism of Gilman's presidency. In the early 20th century the university outgrew its buildings and the trustees began to search for a new home. Developing Clifton for the university was too costly, and so the estate became a public park. In the end, the 140 acres (57ha) estate in north Baltimore known as Homewood was purchased as the university's new campus with assistance from prominent Baltimore citizens.Since the 1910s, Johns Hopkins University has famously been a "fertile cradle" to Arthur Lovejoy's history of ideas.[16]The Johns Hopkins University Press, founded in 1878, is the oldest American university press in continuous operation. Along with the hospital, Hopkins established one of the nation's oldest schools of nursing in 1889. The school of medicine was America's first coeducational, graduate-level medical school, and was a prototype for academic medicine that emphasized bedside learning, research projects, and laboratory training. In 1909, the university was among the first to start adult continuing education programs and in 1916 it founded the US' first school of public health. Programs in international studies and the performing arts were established in 1950 and 1977 when the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington D.C and the Peabody Institute in Baltimore became divisions of the university.Hopkins was a prominent abolitionist who supported Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War. After his death, reports said his conviction was a decisive factor in enrolling Hopkins' first African-American student, Kelly Miller, a graduate student in physics, astronomy and mathematics, and in admitting Harvard-trained physician Whitfield Winsey and two other African-American physicians to Maryland's Medical and Chirurgical Society MedChi.[17] These physicians could attend meetings only because they were held on campus. As the memory of Hopkins faded and trustees like King died, Hopkins became like other Baltimore institutions, particularly in terms of race. The Johns Hopkins University chronology stated that on March 15, 1892, an administrator hired by Gilman recommended that the hospital should have a "separate ward for colored patients."[18] Johns Hopkins Hospital subsequently became segregated. Johns Hopkins' "separate but equal" stance was evident when it came to these segregated wards: "Special care will be taken to see that the heating and ventilation apparatus is as perfect as possible. A sun balcony will be erected on each floor on the east side, for convalescents, while a sun bay-window will be constructed at the south end of the south wing. On each floor there will be a dining room, kitchen, lavatory and bath-rooms...The building will be fireproof throughout."[18]As segregation grew within Johns Hopkins institutions, it affected pay, hiring and promotions. Staff in segregated wards and those employed in the lower rungs of the service industries had the longest history within the Johns Hopkins Institutions. Johns Hopkins' students, physicians, administrators and staff of African descent had a much shorter history within these institutions. The first black undergraduate was Frederick Scott who entered the school in 1945. In 1967 the first black students earned graduate degrees. Dr. James Nabwangu a British-trained Kenyan, was the first black graduate of the medical school. A second was earned by Robert Gamble.[19]The first African-American instructor was laboratory supervisor Vivien Thomas, who also invented and developed research instruments, served as an assistant in surgery to surgeon Alfred Blalock and worked closely with Blalock and Helen Taussig in developing and conducting the first successful blue baby operation. Black students and professionals were rare at Johns Hopkins Institutions and Maryland's state medical societies until after the 1940s. Diversity increased only in the 1960s and 1970s. African-Americans and women were labeled "The Uninvited" in the second major history of the university.[citation needed]Hopkins' most wellknown battle for women's rights was the one led by daughters of trustees of the university; Mary E. Garrett, M. Carey Thomas, Mamie Gwinn, Elizabeth King, and Julia Rogers.[20] They donated and raised the funds needed to open the medical school, and required Hopkins' officials to agree to their stipulation that women would be admitted. Unfortunately, this stipulation applied only to the medical school. Other graduate schools were opened to women by president Ira Remsen only in 1907. Christine Ladd-Franklin was the first woman to earn a PhD at Hopkins, in mathematics in 1882. The trustees denied her the degree and refused to change the policy about admitting women; she finally received her degree 44 years later. In 1893 Florence Bascomb became the university's first female PhD.[20]The nursing school opened in 1889 and accepted women and men as students.The decision to admit women at undergraduate level was not considered until the late 1960s and was eventually adopted in October 1969; in the fall of 1970, 90 females, five of them African-American, became undergraduates. In the academic year 19701971, 4.7% of students in the Arts and Sciences programs were women. In the year 19851986 the proportion of female students in the Arts and Sciences programs had increased to around 38%. As of 20092010, the undergraduate population was 47% female and 53% male.[21]The first campus was located on Howard Street. Eventually, they relocated to Homewood, in northern Baltimore, the estate of Charles Carroll, son of the oldest surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. Carroll's Homewood House is considered one of the finest examples of Federal residential architecture. The estate then came to the Wyman family, which participated in making it the park-like main campus of the schools of arts and sciences and engineering at the start of the 20th century. Most of its architecture was modeled after the Federal style of Homewood House. Homewood House is preserved as a museum. Most undergraduate programs are here.Collectively known as Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI) campus, the East Baltimore facility occupies several city blocks spreading from the Johns Hopkins Hospital trademark dome.The Washington, D.C. campus is on Massachusetts Avenue.The Applied Physics Laboratory, a division of the university co-equal to the nine schools but with a non-academic mission, lies between Baltimore and Washington in Laurel, Maryland.In 2009, JHU ranked fifth among US universities in private fundraising, collecting $433.39 million.[34]The President is JHU's chief executive officer, and the university is organized into nine academic divisions.[35]Johns Hopkins University has implemented a number of sustainability initiatives.[36]In 2011, the Sustainable Endowments Institute gave Johns Hopkins a College Sustainability Report Card grade of "C+." In particular the Institute criticized JHU for failing to disclose its endowment's holdings and proxy voting record on environmental issues.[37]In 2007 carbon emissions were inventoried and electric vehicles were used for some campus transportation needs.As of 2007 dining services managers sought locallysourced produce and seafood, and integrated organic food into menus.[38] In addition, the smaller cafs around campus sell exclusively organic, shadegrown coffees. A small pilot composting program operated on the undergraduate campus.[38]In 2007 the university was pursuing LEED certification for several buildings.[38] Energy retrofits in certain buildings have resulted in over 50% less energy consumption.[38] Retrofits included a green roof, experimentation with waterless urinals and low-flow shower heads, and upgraded fluorescent lighting that reduced electricity for lighting on one campus by over 40 percent. Similar lighting retrofits were underway at all campuses. At the beginning of 2012, Hopkins sustainability announced the installation of 2,708 solar panels atop buildings at Homewood (Rec/Athletic Center, Mattin Center), the Eastern Building on 33rd Street and the East Baltimore Campus (Pinkard Building, 2024 Building, Bloomberg Building, Hampton House). These solar panels will produce 997,400 kWh and decrease 1,200,000lbs of greenhouse gases each year.[39]In 2004, one campus completed a water conservation retrofit that annually saved over 8,000,000 US gallons (30,000,000l) of water.[38]As of 2010 students contributed significantly to environmental initiatives, setting up the JHU recycling program, hosting a national "Greening" conference, launching a transportation shuttle service between campuses and making the campus more bike-friendly.[36] Each year, students conduct the "S.E.X.:I.T." competition to see which dormitory can save the most electricity.[40]The Johns Hopkins entity is structured as two corporations, the university and The Johns Hopkins Health System, formed in 1986. The latter has grown into the bigger entity, with fiscal year 2005 consolidated net revenue of $3.3 billion, employing 27,700 people, including some 4,700 fulltime physicians.[35]JHU's bylaws specify a Board of Trustees of between 18 and 65 voting members. Trustees serve sixyear terms subject to a twoterm limit. The alumni select 12 trustees. Four recent alumni serve 4-year terms, one per year, typically from the graduating class. The bylaws prohibit students, faculty or administrative staff from serving on the Board, except the President as an exofficio trustee.[41] The Johns Hopkins Health System has a separate Board of Trustees, many of whom are doctors or health care executives. Some JHU Trustees also serve on the Johns Hopkins Health System Board.[42]The full-time, four year undergraduate program is "most selective"[43] with low transfer-in and a high graduate co-existence.[44] The cost of attendance per year is $60,820, however the average need met is 99%.[45]The university is one of fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities (AAU); it is also a member of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE) and the Universities Research Association (URA).In 2010, 87% of admitted students graduated in the top tenth of their high school class and the inter-quartile range on the SAT reading was 670750, math was 690780, and writing was 670770. 97% of freshmen returned after the first year, 84% of students graduated in 4 years and 92% graduated in 6 years.[48] The average GPA of enrolled freshmen is 3.74. Over time, applications to Johns Hopkins University have risen steadily. As a result, the selectivity of Johns Hopkins University has also increased. Early Decision is an option at Johns Hopkins University for students who wish to demonstrate that the university is their first choice. These students, if admitted, are required to enroll. This application is due November 1. Most students, however, apply Regular Decision, which is a traditional non-binding round. These applications are due January 1 and students are notified April 1.At the undergraduate level, Hopkins was ranked #13 among National Universities by U.S. News and World Report (USNWR).[57] It is ranked #1 in the nation in the high school counselor reputation rankings.[58] The 2012 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) ranked Hopkins #17 internationally (#15 nationally) and 3rd in the world for Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy.[59] In 2010, Johns Hopkins ranked 13th in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings[60] and 16th in the 2011 QS World University Rankings.[61][62][63] Johns Hopkins also placed #2 in the 2010 University Ranking by Academic Performance (URAP),[64] #2 in the 2011 HEEACT  Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities,[65] ranked #7 among Top Performing Schools according to the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index (FSPI) in 2008,[66] and was listed #9 among research universities by the Center for Measuring University Performance in 2007.[67]For medical and public health research U.S. News and World Report ranks the School of Medicine #2[68] and has consistently ranked the Bloomberg School of Public Health #1[69] in the nation. The School of Nursing was ranked #1 nationally among peer institutions.[70] The Times Higher Education Supplement ranked Johns Hopkins University #3 in the world for biomedicine and life sciences.[71] Hopkins ranks #1 nationally in receipt of federal research funds and the School of Medicine is #1 among medical schools in receipt of extramural awards from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).[72] Newsweek named Johns Hopkins as the "Hottest School for Pre-meds" in 2008.[73] The Johns Hopkins Hospital was ranked as the top hospital in the United States for the eighteenth year in a row by the U.S. News and World Report annual ranking of American hospitals.[74]The university's graduate programs in the areas of Biological & Biomedical Sciences, Engineering (Biomedical, Electrical & Environmental), Human Development & Family Studies, Health Sciences, Humanities, Physical & Mathematical Sciences and International Affairs & Development all rank among the top-10 of their respective disciplines.[75][76]The Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) ranked #1 (2005), #2 (2007), and #2 (2009), by College of William and Mary's surveys conducted once every two years beginning in 2005, for its MA program among the world's top schools of International Affairs for those who want to pursue a policy career.[citation needed]The School of Education is ranked #6 nationally by U.S. News and World Report.[77] Although no formal rankings exist for music conservatories, the Peabody Institute is generally considered one of the most prestigious conservatories in the country, along with Juilliard and the Curtis Institute.Johns Hopkins is ranked the #1 Social Media College by StudentAdvisor.[78] Several university departments have been known to actively engage on various social media platforms such as Blogs, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr to reach prospective students, current students, and alumni.[79]The Johns Hopkins University Library system houses more than 3.6 million volumes.[80] It includes ten main divisions: the Sheridan Libraries at Homewood, the Welch Medical Library, the Medical Institution Libraries, the School of Nursing Library, Abraham M. Lilienfeld Library at the Bloomberg School, the Peabody Institute Library, the Carey Business School and School of Education libraries, the School of Advanced International Studies Libraries (Sydney R. and Elsa W. Mason Library and Bologna Center Library), the R.E. Gibson Library at the Applied Physics Laboratory Library and other minor satellite locations, as well as the archives.The Milton S. Eisenhower Library, located on the Homewood campus, is the main library. It was built in the 1960s. It houses over 2.6 million volumes and over 20,000 journal subscriptions. The Eisenhower Library is a member of the university's Sheridan Libraries encompassing collections at the Albert D. Hutzler Reading Room (called "The Hut" by students) in Gilman Hall, the John Work Garrett Library at Evergreen House, and the George Peabody Library at Mount Vernon Place. Together these collections provide the major research library resources for the university, serving Johns Hopkins academic programs worldwide. The library was named for Milton S. Eisenhower, former president of the university and brother of former U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower. JHU's library was previously housed in Gilman Hall, and other smaller departmental libraries throughout the Homewood campus.[81]Only two of the Eisenhower library's six stories are above ground, though the architects designed the building so that every level has windows and natural light. The design accords with a bit of traditional campus lore that no structure can be taller than Gilman Hall, the oldest academic building ( although no written rule limits building height). In December 2008, an addition directly to the south of the library was announced. The six-and-a-half-story expansion will be named the Brody Learning Commons in honor of University President William R. Brody and will function as a "collaborative learning space." It successfully opened on August 13, 2012.[82][83]The opportunity to participate in important research is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Hopkins' undergraduate education. About 80 percent of undergraduates perform independent research, often alongside top researchers.[44][84] In FY 2009, Johns Hopkins received $1.856 billion in federal research grantsmore than any other US university.[7] Thirty-seven (37) Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with the university as alumni or faculty members.[85] JHU views its academic strengths as being in art history, biological, physical and other natural sciences, biomedical engineering, creative writing, English, history, economics, international studies, medicine, music, neuroscience, nursing, political theory, public health, public policy, and the Romance languages.[citation needed]Between 1999 and 2009, Johns Hopkins was among the most cited institutions in the world. It attracted nearly 1,222,166 citations and produced 54,022 papers under its name, ranking #3 globally behind Harvard University and Max Planck Society with the highest total citations published in Thomson Reuters-indexed journals over 22 fields in America.[9]In FY 2000, Johns Hopkins received $95.4 million in research grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), making it the leading recipient of NASA research and development funding.[86] In FY 2002, Hopkins became the first university to cross the $1 billion threshold on either list, recording $1.14 billion in total research and $1.023 billion in federally sponsored research. In FY 2008, Johns Hopkins University performed $1.68 billion in science, medical and engineering research, making it the leading U.S. academic institution in total R&D spending for the 30th year in a row, according to a National Science Foundation (NSF) ranking.[87] These totals include grants and expenditures of JHU's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. The Johns Hopkins University also offers the "Center for Talented Youth" programa nonprofit organization dedicated to identifying and developing the talents of the most promising K-12 grade students worldwide. As part of the Johns Hopkins University, the "Center for Talented Youth" or CTY helps fulfill the university's mission of preparing students to make significant future contributions to the world.[7]The Johns Hopkins University Press is the publishing division of the Johns Hopkins University. It was founded in 1878 and holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously running university press in the United States.[97] To date the Press has published more than 6,000 titles and currently publishes 65 scholarly periodicals and over 200 new books each year. Since 1993, the Johns Hopkins University Press has run Project MUSE, an online collection of over 250 fulltext, peerreviewed journals in the humanities and social sciences. The Press also houses the Hopkins Fulfilment Services (HFS), which handles distribution for a number of university presses and publishers. Taken together, the three divisions of the PressBooks, Journals (including MUSE) and HFSmake it one of the largest of America's university presses.The Johns Hopkins Student Government Association represents undergraduates in campus issues and projects. It is elected annually.[98] Blueprints for a new programming board called The Hopkins Organization for Programming ("The HOP") were drawn up during the summer and fall of 2006.In addition Charles Village, the region of North Baltimore surrounding the university, has undergone several restoration projects, and the university has gradually bought the property around the school for additional student housing and dormitories. The Charles Village Project, scheduled for completion in 2008, brought new commercial spaces to the neighborhood. The project included Charles Commons, a new, modern residence hall that includes popular retail franchises.[99][100]Hopkins invested in improving campus life with an arts complex in 2001, the Mattin Center, and a threestory sports facility, the O'Connor Recreation Center. The large oncampus dining facilities at Homewood were renovated in the summer of 2006.Quality of life is enriched by the proximity of neighboring academic institutions, including Loyola College, Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), UMBC, Goucher College, and Towson University, as well as nearby Inner Harbor.Annually, the Johns Hopkins Spring Fair is held on the Homewood campus over a three day weekend in mid-to-late April. Food, arts and crafts, and nonprofit vendors, along with a popular musical act and various other activities attract nearly 25,000 people from the greater BaltimoreWashington area. The Spring Fair is the largest entirely studentrun fair in the country.Since 1972, the Johns Hopkins Outdoors Club, or JHOC, has organized weekend trips for students looking to experience the outdoors. Along with Outdoor Pursuits, an arm of the University's Rec Center, JHOC offers students the opportunity to participate in activities such as canoeing, kayaking, caving, and mountain biking.Living on campus is required for first- and second-year students, except for commuter students who live with a parent or legal guardian.[101] Housing is not guaranteed for juniors or seniors at Johns Hopkins.Freshmen housing is centered around Freshman Quad, which consists of three major residence hall complexes: The Alumni Memorial Residences (AMR I and AMR II), Building A and Building B.[102] AMR I was built in 1923 and includes Royce, Sylvester, Vincent, Willard, Wilson and Wood houses; AMR II in 1954, holding Adams, Baker, Clark, Gildersleeve, Griffin, Hollander, Jennings, Lazear houses.[citation needed] The houses were named for Hopkins Alumni who died in World Wars I and II. While each house has its own outside entrance, there are no dividers indoors that distinguish them. In 1983, Buildings A and B were added to Freshmen Quad.[citation needed] They have not yet been dedicated. Freshmen are also housed in Wolman Hall and the terrace floor of McCoy Hall, located on the other side of North Charles Street.[102]Freshman enter a housing lottery in their spring semester to determine where they will live during their sophomore year. Juniors and seniors may choose between entering the campus housing lottery or moving into nearby apartments or row houses. They occupy one of four buildings.[103] The first, McCoy Hall, is located next to Wolman Hall on North Charles Street. McCoy Hall is predominantly composed of sophomores and transfer students.[104] Apartment-style housing is offered in the Bradford Apartments, one block east of campus on St. Paul Street, and in the Homewood Apartments, two blocks south on North Charles Street.[103] The last is Charles Commons, the newest and largest universityowned dormitory, located at the corner of North Charles and East 33rd. It was completed in 2006 to house 618 students and represented a major step by the university towards offering oncampus housing to students.[104] Charles Commons consists of two 11story towers connected by a bridge, residential suites and features a ballroom, fitness center and several conference rooms. Nolan's on 33rd, a dining hall specializing in dinner services, is also located in the building.[104]JHU rents several buildings on North Charles Street to house students when necessary. At full capacity, dormitory buildings can house approximately 60% of undergraduates.[citation needed] Privatelyowned apartment buildings around Homewood are usually filled with Hopkins upperclassmen, so despite the lack of universityowned dormitories, housing is available.The University Office of Greek Life recognizes thirteen fraternities and eight sororities, which include approximately 25% of the student body. Greek life has been a part of the university culture since 1877, when Beta Theta Pi fraternity became the first to form a chapter on campus. Sororities arrived at Hopkins in 1982. As with all Hopkins programs, Greek discrimination on the basis of "marital status, pregnancy, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status" is prohibited.[105] JHU also has an antihazing policy[106] and prohibits alcohol at recruitment activities.[107] Hopkins does not permit "citywide" chapters, and requires all members of a JHU recognized fraternity or sorority to be a JHU student.[108]As of spring 2011, 1,208 students were members of one of Hopkins' fraternities or sororities. The AllGreek Average GPA was 3.31, above the undergraduate average GPA.[109] In spring 2010 the university was considering construction of a "fraternity row" of houses to consolidate the groups on campus.[110]All Johns Hopkins fraternities and sororities belong to one of four Councils: the InterFraternity Council, the National Panhellenic Conference, the National Pan-Hellenic Council and the Multicultural Council.The InterFraternity Council includes eleven fraternities:[111]The National Panhellenic Conference includes four sororities:[114]The National PanHellenic Council includes two historically AfricanAmerican groups:[115]The Multicultural Council includes four groups:[116]Delta Phi Fraternity, also known as St. Elmo's, maintains a chapter exclusive to students at Johns Hopkins, though it is not recognized by the Office of Greek Life.Unrecognized Alpha Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta AfricanAmerican interest sororities often recruit Johns Hopkins undergraduates, in their citywide chapters. Delta Sigma Theta was the first National PanHellenic Council member to charter on the campus in 1976, as well as the first sorority of any kind on the JHU campus.[citation needed]Kappa Alpha Theta, a National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sorority, was disbanded by its national headquarters on April 14, 2009 after twelve years on campus.[117] The removal was due to repeated risk management violations.[citation needed]In March 2010, Johns Hopkins University officially opened for NPC extension.[clarification needed] In May 2010, the University Panhellenic Council selected Pi Beta Phi, which opened in the fall of 2010.[citation needed][118]Recruitment for InterFraternity Council and Panhellenic Conference fraternities and sororities takes place during the spring semester for freshmen, though some groups recruit upperclassmen during the fall semester.[citation needed] All participants must have completed one semester and must be in good academic standing.[citation needed]Many of the fraternities maintain houses off campus, but no sororities do.[citation needed] Baltimore City allows housing to be zoned specifically for use as a fraternity or sorority house, but in practice this zoning code has not been awarded for at least 50 years.[citation needed] Only Sigma Phi Epsilon's building has this zoning code due to its consistent ownership since the 1920s.[119]Hopkins has many student publications.Hopkins Student Enterprises (HSE)[132] is a startup incubator with the goal of fostering student innovation and encouraging the development of studentrun businesses. Currently, four businesses are in operation:[133]Athletic teams are called Blue Jays. Even though sable and gold are used for academic robes, the university's athletic colors are Columbia blue (PMS 284) and black.[136] Hopkins celebrates Homecoming in the spring to coincide with the height of the lacrosse season. The Men's and Women's lacrosse teams are in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. Other teams are in Division III and participate in the Centennial Conference. JHU is also home to the Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame, maintained by US Lacrosse.The school's most prominent team is its men's lacrosse team. The team does not belong to a conference. The team has won 44 national titles  nine Division I (2007, 2005, 1987, 1985, 1984, 1980, 1979, 1978, 1974), 29 United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA), and six Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (ILA) titles. Hopkins' primary national rivals are Princeton University, Syracuse University, and the University of Virginia; its primary intrastate rivals are Loyola College (competing in what is called the "Charles Street Massacre"), Towson University, the United States Naval Academy, and the University of Maryland. The rivalry with Maryland is the oldest. The schools have met 103 times since 1899, twice in playoff matches.The women's team is a member of the American Lacrosse Conference (ALC). The team is developing into a top twenty team. The Lady Blue Jays were ranked number 19 in the 2008 Inside Lacrosse Women's DI Media Poll (ILWDIMP). They ranked number 8 in both the 2007 Intercollegiate Women's Lacrosse Coaches Association (IWLCA) Poll for Division I and the ILWDIMP. In 2006, they were ranked 14th in the ILWDIMP, in 2005, they were 11th, and, in 2004, they were 9th. However, recently the team has struggled and finished with a record of 5 wins and 12 losses in the 2009 season.Hopkins has notable Division III Athletic teams. JHU Men's Swimming won three consecutive NCAA Championships in 1977, 1978, and 1979.[137] In 20092010, Hopkins won 8 Centennial Conference titles in Women's Cross Country, Women's Track & Field, Baseball, Men's and Women's Soccer, Football, and Men's and Women's Tennis. The Women's Cross Country team became the first women's team at Hopkins to achieve a #1 National ranking. In 20062007 teams won Centennial Conference titles in Baseball, Men's and Women's Soccer, Men's and Women's Tennis and Men's Basketball. Hopkins has an acclaimed fencing team, which ranked in the top three Division III teams in the past few years and in both 2008 and 2007 defeated the University of North Carolina, a Division I team. In 2008, they defeated UNC and won the MACFA championship.The Swimming team ranked highly in NCAA Division III for the last 10 years, most recently placing second at DIII Nationals in 2008. The Water Polo team was number one in Division III for several of the past years, playing a full schedule against Division I opponents. Hopkins also has a century-old rivalry with McDaniel College (formerly Western Maryland College), playing the Green Terrors 83 times in football since the first game in 1894. In 2009 the football team reached the quarterfinals of the NCAA Division III tournament, with three tournament appearances since 2005. In 2008, the baseball team ranked second, losing in the final game of the DIII College World Series to Trinity College.[138]As of 2011, there had been 37 Nobel Laureates, who attended the university as undergraduate students, graduate students or were faculty members.[139] Woodrow Wilson, who received his PhD from Johns Hopkins in 1886, was Hopkins' first affiliated laureate, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919.[139][140] Twenty-three laureates were faculty members, five earned PhDs, eight earned M.D. while Francis Peyton Rous and Martin Rodbell earned undergraduate degrees.Eighteen Johns Hopkins laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, more than any other category.[139] Four Nobel Prizes were shared by Johns Hopkins laureates: George Minot and George Whipple won the 1934 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,[141] Joseph Erlanger and Herbert Spencer Gasser won the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,[142] Daniel Nathans and Hamilton O. Smith won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,[143] and David H. Hubel and Torsten N. Wiesel won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[144] Two Johns Hopkins laureates won Nobel Prizes in Physics, Riccardo Giacconi in 2002 [145] and Adam Riess in 2011.

Whiting School of Engineering: The Whiting School contains 14 undergraduate and graduate engineering programs and 12 additional areas of study.[23]School of Education: Originally established in 1909 as The School of Professional Studies in Business and Education, the divisions of Education and Business became separate schools in 2007.School of Nursing: The School of Nursing is is one of America's oldest and pre-eminent schools for nursing education. It has consistently ranked first in the nation.[24]School of Medicine: The School of Medicine is widely regarded as one of the best medical schools and biomedical research institutes in the world.[25][26]Bloomberg School of Public Health: The Bloomberg School was founded in 1916, the world's first and largest public health school. It has consistently been ranked first in its field.[27]Carey Business School: The Carey Business School was established in 2007, incorporating divisions of the former School of Professional Studies in Business and Education. It was originally located on Charles Street, but relocated to the Legg Mason building in Harbor East in 2011.Peabody Institute: founded in 1857, is the oldest continuously active music conservatory in the United States; it became a division of Johns Hopkins in 1977. The Conservatory retains its own student body and grants degrees in musicology and performance, though both Hopkins and Peabody students may take courses at both institutions.

In October 1934, Dean Edward R.

Henry M. Gunn High School is one of two public high schools in Palo Alto, California. Gunn High School is a four-year high school with a current enrollment of just over 1,900 students.[1]The academic year has two semesters with 240 minutes of weekly instruction for every class. The school's schedule operates on a rotating bell schedule with classes assigned to lettered "periods" from A through G.In the spring of 2010, Gunn High School was picketed by the Westboro Baptist Church. Rather than responding with violence, students and staff staged a successful counter-demonstration in the form of a Phelps-A-Thon. As a result, the school received favorable press and publicity and raised more than $1,100.00 for its gay-straight alliance.[2][3]Gunn is well known for its academically rigorous environment and enjoys a spirited academic and athletic rivalry with nearby Palo Alto High School.Established in 1964, Gunn High School was named after the late Henry M. Gunn (18981988), who served as the Palo Alto superintendent from 1950 to 1961. In 1964, the Palo Alto Unified School District announced it would name the district's third high school after him. The Class of 1966 was the first class to graduate from Gunn High School.[4]U.S. News & World Report rated Gunn High School 66th in 2007, 74th in 2008, and 64th in 2010.[5] Newsweek rated Gunn High School the 81st best high school in America in 2008 and 42nd in 2011.[6]95.9% of the graduating class go on to attend college, with 80.2% going to four-year colleges. The average SAT score for Gunn seniors is 1942 for the Class of 2010 (633 CR, 673 M, 636 W).[7] Gunn has one of the highest average SAT scores for public high schools in the United States. Gunn also has many students who are selected as National Merit Semifinalists  43 in 2007, 44 in 2008, 31 in 2009, 42 in 2010, 30 in 2011, and 36 in 2012.[8] In addition, 50 students received a National Merit letter of commendation in 2007, 50 in 2008, 60 in 2009, 68 in 2010 and 74 in 2011. Usually 25% of the Gunn senior class receives one of these two National Merit honors.Gunn offers 22 AP classes and 8 Honors classes that count for the weighted GPA.[7] In May 2010, 657 students took 1820 AP tests. 93% scored 3 or higher and 54% scored a grade of 5. Gunn does not rank students individually  ranking is reported by decile.[7]Education in mathematics and sciences is particularly strong. In 2004, 5 students qualified for the USAMO out of around 250 nationally, and during the 20042005 school year 5 out of the approximately 35 American students in the Gold Division of the USACO were from Gunn. In 2009, nine students qualified for the USAMO. Gunn also consistently places in the Top 3 at the Bay Area Mathematics Olympiad (BAMO). In 2011, the Gunn team placed 9th at the Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament.In 2011, Gunn had four national semifinalists in the Siemens Competition and the Intel Science Talent Search, two of the most prestigious science competitions in America. In each competition, one individual went on to compete at the finalist stage.[9][10]Gunn is also host to PLTW, an organization that promotes science, technology, engineering, and math. Courses from this program include Digital Electronics and Introduction to Engineering Design, as well as Principles of Engineering.[11] However, in the 2012-2013 school year, only Introduction to Engineering Design will be offered. Digital Electronics was cancelled due to low enrollment and Principles of Engineering was cancelled due to funding issues.The ethnic and racial makeup of the 20102011 student population are: Caucasian  49.5%, Asian  34.9%, Hispanic  7.4%, Asian Indian  5.5%, African American  2.1%, Multiple or no response  20.2%. Males make up 51.0% and females make up 49.0%.[12] Approximately 6% of the student body are economically disadvantaged and 4% are English Learners.Gunn offers over 80 student clubs, teams, and organizations that focus on art, community action, culture, environment, politics, music, dance, journalism, and more.The Oracle is Gunn's official student newspaper publication. The organization was established in 1964. The newspaper publishes nine issues of approximately 28 pages every school year and concludes the year with the publication of a Senior Issue.[13]The Gunn Associated Student Body Student Executive Council (SEC) is in charge of maintaining student funds and planning and executing activities that foster school spirit and make high school memorable.[14] SEC handles Homecoming Week, Spring Fling, school dances, special events, and rallies on campus. SEC is led by an elected President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Class Presidents and VP's, and various Commissioners.[15]Gunn students stage three major productions every year (Fall, Spring and One Acts) and occasional staged readings.[16] Current theatre director James Shelby has been with the program since 1983.The Gunn Music Program has a long and proud tradition of excellence, achieving outstanding group results while rewarding individual competence and dedication.[17] The program contains several music groups including a Symphonic Band, Wind Ensemble, Jazz Ensemble, Orchestra, Concert Band, Concert Choir, and Chamber Singers.The acclaimed[18][19] Gunn Robotics Team (GRT), established in 1997, has consistently placed in the top 25 at the FIRST Robotics Competition. It is also the only FIRST Robotics team to have won the national animation award more than once, winning in 1997, 2006, and 2012. They also won best models worldwide in their 2010 animation.[20] In 2012 The Robotics Team won the Chesapeake Bay Regional in Baltimore and won National FRC Championship Excellence in Design Award (3D Animation) sponsored by Autodesk. GRT is the only team that has won a total of three Animation awards in the history of FIRST.[21]Coordinates: 372356N 1220759W / 37.399N 122.133W / 37.399; -122.1331 History2 Academic reputation

The Digital Media Academy (commonly referred to as "DMA") is a digital art and technology training company, corporately located in Los Gatos, CA, offering Stanford University Continuing Studies accredited courses for adults as well as summer camp programs for kids, age 6-18, computer camp and tech camp at several universities in the US and Canada.[1] DMA was officially incorporated in 2002, but was incubated at Stanford University in the late 1990s as the Academy for New Media, a program of Stanfords Academic Computing department. The Academy for New Media was created at Stanford in 1999 as an outreach to K-12 educators and high-school students interested in learning the latest digital media software tools from award-winning creative professionals.[2] In Fall 2001, the Academy for New Media fell victim to University budget cuts and the program was transitioned away from Stanford to a private entity  and the Digital Media Academy was born. The Stanford University Continuing Studies department has continued to offer CEU credit through the Digital Media Academy since its inception in 2002.[3] Students may attend Digital Media Academy summer camps with the day camp or sleepaway camp option. These camps offer sports and recreation, while being known as computer camp or tech camp primarily.For adult-learners, DMA offers various industry certifications in topics like 3D Animation, Film Production, Game Programing, Mobile Device Programing and Web Design, and is also an Apple Inc. Authorized Training Center[4] and Adobe Systems Training Partner.[5] For youth, DMA offers summer computer camps, including sleep away camps at the University of British Columbia, Stanford University, UCLA, UCSD, the University of Texas at Austin, George Washington University, Drexel University, Swarthmore College, Harvard University and the University of Chicago.[6]The Digital Media Academy offers a robust scholarship program[7] to make its courses accessible to everyone and has partnered with various non-profit and community-focused organizations including the New Media Consortium[8] and the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus.[9]
Blue Collar TV is a television program that aired on The WB Television Network with lead actors Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy. The show's humor dealt principally with contemporary American society, and especially hillbilly, redneck, and Southern stereotypes. The show was greenlighted on the heels of the success of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. It was created by Fax Bahr and Adam Small, in addition to J.P. Williams and Jeff Foxworthy. Blue Collar is a US phrase used to describe manual laborers, as opposed to White Collar for office or professional workers.Fellow Blue Collar Comedy Tour costar Ron White declined to star on Blue Collar TV due to a fear of being typecast as "blue collar." However, he guest-starred on many episodes of the show. On his 2006 comedy album, You Can't Fix Stupid, White jokingly cited his own lack of work ethic as a reason for not participating more on the show.Unlike most sketch comedy programs, each episode of Blue Collar TV was generally centered around a theme, which Foxworthy reveals at the start of each episode. Themes included "Food", "Kids", and "Stupidity", among others. Foxworthy occasionally does a comedic monologue based on the theme.The show originated from the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta. Later episodes of season 1 and all episodes of season 2 were taped at The Classic Center in Athens, Georgia, although the show taped at the House of Blues in New Orleans during a two-episode road trip in 2004. Later episodes were filmed during their Blue Collar tour.The show halted production a few weeks into the 2005 fall season. It was also removed from the lineups of both Comedy Central and the WB. No official statement was given by the WB, though Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy both confirmed the end of Blue Collar TV on their websites.Blue Collar TV returned on May 31, 2006, to finish airing its second season throughout the summer as filler for the final weeks of The WB, which would shut down later that year. The show did not move to The CW. In summer 2006, Foxworthy started his own show, Foxworthy's Big Night Out, which aired on Country Music Television and retained some aspects of the Blue Collar TV format. It was canceled after its first season. As of Summer 2010 the show is in reruns on CMT.Blue Collar TV had many guest stars during its short run. Sometimes, it was a musical guest that performs at the end of the episode. In most cases, the musical guest also takes part in at least one sketch.Guests have included:Note: Due to the show's relatively short life, no cast members were added or removed during the show's run.Season releases1 Recurring sketches2 Guest appearances3 Cast members4 DVD releases5 External links"Bad Jobs for Take Your Daughter to Work Day:" This sketch features Foxworthy, Engvall, or Larry the Cable Guy at a job with their "daughter" tagging along. Their job is always something that would make Take-Your-Daughter-To-Work-Day awkward, such as NASCAR driver or Newscaster."Big Kids:" Foxworthy, Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy play Ronnie, Blake, and Dooley, three toddlers who constantly misbehave and annoy their parents, usually from the back seat of their car."Bill The Bad Storyteller:" Bill Engvall tries to tell a story to his friends, but he's unable to tell it very well. In most cases, the story starts off interesting or creepy, but the conclusion is very plain and boring."Dan Grogan:" Grogan (Foxworthy) is the spokesman and owner of Dan Grogan's House of Gravy and Gravy Spa. Grogan's company also makes and sells Pre-chewed Food and Ranch Cleanser. Grogan's restaurants and spas are well known for their "Gravy Bombs" (balloons filled with brown gravy) and appearances by "Seargant Gravy(Engvall) & Davey the Gravy Dog"."Dinner With...:" After a short skit featuring a character saying who he wouldn't want to be invited over for dinner, the scenario is shown featuring a typical family, with that very person over for dinner. The dinner guests have included Hank Williams Jr., Joe Rogan, and Jeff Jarrett."Fat Family:" Engvall, Brooke Dillman, and Ayda Field play a family of morbidly obese people, though they are proud of their physical state and don't like skinny people or the thought of losing weight. Their appearances usually revolve around normal sitcom happenings, though modified to suit their happiness of their weight."Martha Stewart's Tips from the Inside:" Martha Stewart (Dillman) gives household hints from jail, each hint inspired by her prison experiences."The Martin Bros.:" Casey, Jack, and Dale Martin (Foxworthy, Engvall, and Larry the Cable Guy), are three unruly brothers who drink all the time, play jokes on people, and never take anything seriously. They were first seen hosting the show "Hick Eye For The Queer Guy", and later opened a party planning company."On the Red Carpet with Dee & Engle Barry:" Dee & Engle (Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy) interview big names in country music at the Country Music Awards red carpet pre show."Politically Correct Fairy Tales:" Larry the Cable Guy reads fairy tales that are now politically correct from his niece's (or nephew's) fairy tale book (Snow Caucasian and the Seven Handy Capable Little Persons, for example) to the children. He isn't impressed with the stories in their new state, and usually stops before the story is finished, (except The Tortoise and the Hare in the Non-Competitive Fun Run), to explain "how it really ends", which usually involves him going into the story, and abruptly ending it (For example, in "Vertically-Challenged Native American Riding Hood and the endangered wolf" He ends the story by saying "I go in there, I shoot the wolf, send grandma to an old folks home, get Little Red Riding Hood out of that hood, and shack up and eat wolf steaks."). Other "Politically Correct Fairy Tales" that have been told by Larry the Cable Guy:

"Jack and the Organic Beanstalk" (formerly known as Jack and the Beanstalk).
"Twas The Night Before A Non-denominational Winter Holiday" (formerly known as Twas the Night Before Christmas).
"A Child's Guide to Health and Wellness" (formerly known as Hansel and Gretel).

"Jack and the Organic Beanstalk" (formerly known as Jack and the Beanstalk)."Twas The Night Before A Non-denominational Winter Holiday" (formerly known as Twas the Night Before Christmas)."A Child's Guide to Health and Wellness" (formerly known as Hansel and Gretel)."Redneck Dictionary:" On each episode, an entry in "The Redneck Dictionary" is shown, where cast members take common words and morph them into perceived redneck speech. An example would be "Artichoke" (I "artichoke" the feller who told me to order this). Only recurring sketch used in every episode. It is published by Hatfield-McCoy and is a parody of Merriam-Webster."Redneck Yard of the Week:" Each week, Foxworthy and Ayda Field present a Redneck Yard Of The Week, as submitted by home viewers to http://www.redneckyard.com. The presentation is done like an awards ceremony, with Foxworthy providing commentary on the winning yard after the yard is shown."Rescue 911!:" A parody of the TV show of the same name, hosted by Jim Farnsworth (Foxworthy). Each episode inexplicably revolves around the Parker family, after Tom (Oldring) gets devastating injuries caused inadvertently by his grandma, followed by the dad (Larry) calling 911, and the EMT's arriving, where Jim Mayweather (Williams) suffers similar injuries, and Don Clinton (Engvall) saves the day."Tell Me That Don't Stink:" Here, Foxworthy has the female cast members (Heath and an audience member also played once each) smell a substance that doesn't smell very pleasant at all. Smelled items include doe-in-heat urine and valerian root."The Deck:" four friends sit on a deck and tell deck stories.The first with comic/actor Drew Carey."The Tacketts:" A dysfunctional redneck family, in a sitcom-like environment. Each episode involves a conflict, usually involving the bickering father and mother (Jeff and Brooke), though each episode ends happily. Also features Larry, Bill, and Ashley as the other members of the family."CSI:" based on the TV show CSI, it talks about crimes that take place, for example the Greensboro Tri-County Area, finds evidence of the crime and finds the criminal."The What Burns Me Booth:" This is a sort of testimonial booth where various people say what burns them up."White Trash Days Of Our Lives:" A spoof of Days of our Lives, which Ayda Field costars in. Follows the formula of a soap opera except with redneck characters."Who's the Fool:" A game show featuring two contestants listening to humorous stories from Engvall, Foxworthy, and Larry the Cable Guy, then deciding whether or not the story is true.Though not technically a recurring sketch, many episodes feature a parody of a TV show or movie, only featuring Larry the Cable Guy as the star. Such examples have included "The Real Bachelor" (a parody of The Bachelor), "Larry the Spider Guy" (a parody of Spider-Man), and "Handicops" (a parody of COPS)."Totes TV-A skit featuring Brook, Ashley, Ayda and Bill playing a woman hosting a talk show television show with a sorority background. The girls act out of excitement and incoherently whenever they have a celebrity guest on. Travis Trit being one of them."Jack and the Organic Beanstalk" (formerly known as Jack and the Beanstalk)."Twas The Night Before A Non-denominational Winter Holiday" (formerly known as Twas the Night Before Christmas)."A Child's Guide to Health and Wellness" (formerly known as Hansel and Gretel).AbyssTrace AdkinsBig & RichClint BlackJeremy BorashBrooks & DunnDrew CareyDeana CarterRonny CoxDiana DeGarmoJeff Dunham and WalterFredi Gonzalez, manager for the Atlanta BravesJeff JarrettChristopher KnightAdam LaRoche, first baseman for the Atlanta BravesRascal FlattsMontgomery GentryLonestarSterling MarlinDavid Lee MurphyTerry Pendleton, hitting coach for the Atlanta BravesBilly ReddenLeAnn RimesBrad PittTrick PonyMark Richt, head coach of the University of Georgia Bulldogs football teamJohn Smoltz, pitcher for the Atlanta BravesHeath SlaterA.J.

Coordinates: 3726N 12210W / 37.43N 122.17W / 37.43; -122.17The Stanford University School of Education (SUSE) is one of the seven schools of Stanford University. It is the second-oldest school of education in the United States, after the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development at New York University.[citation needed] Its mission is, "To continue as a world leader in ground-breaking, cross-disciplinary inquiries that shape educational practices, their conceptual underpinnings, and the professions that serve the enterprise."[2] Many prominent educational theories, policies, and inventions have come from, or been influenced by, the School of Education, including the Stanford-Binet IQ test and various LeapFrog products.The School of Education was founded in 1891 as the Department of the History and Art of Education, and was one of the original twenty-one departments at the newly incorporated Stanford University. It awarded its first Ph.D. in 1916, and in 1917 was renamed the School of Education.[3] The School of Education building and Cubberley Library were built in 1938, and the STEP program was established in 1959. In 2001, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation donated $5 million to establish the School Redesign Network. Stanford established a charter school, the East Palo Alto Academy, which has been managed by its New Schools initiative since then. In 2008, the faculty decided unanimously to make scholarly articles available as open educational resources, the first such move by a school of education.The School of Education offers nine master's[4] and four doctoral[5] degree programs, as well as undergraduate honors and minors programs. As a graduate school of education, the undergraduate programs are not degree programs, but instead offer education-related training for students majoring in other areas, as well as co-terminal master's degrees. The largest program at the School is the Stanford Teacher Education Program, or STEP, which is the only program which offers a teaching credential for K-12 teachers. Unlike many other schools of education, the doctoral programs are academic rather than professional doctorates, and grant Ph.D. instead of Ed.D. degrees.The School also offers numerous professional development programs and resources for practicing elementary and secondary school teachers. These include the Center for the Support of Excellence in Teaching (CSET), the National Board Resource Center (NBRC), the Problem-Solving Cycle, and Stanford English Learner Education Services.[6]Since U.S. News & World Report began ranking schools of education, Stanford has frequently been #1 overall in the United States and has received the top peer assessment score of any school every year.[citation needed] The doctoral program admits 7.2% of applicants, the lowest acceptance rate in the country.[7]One criticism of the school, common to most schools of education in the United States,[citation needed] is that it overemphasizes the philosophy of progressive education vs. traditional education.[12] In 2009, a dispute occurred between a student and faculty member, apparently stemming from these philosophical differences.[13] The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education intervened, and the dean ultimately resolved the matter.[14]1 History2 Academics

Ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice[1]) is a frozen dessert usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavours. Most varieties contain sugar, although some are made with other sweeteners. In some cases, artificial flavourings and colourings are used in addition to, or instead of, the natural ingredients. The mixture of chosen ingredients is stirred slowly while cooling, in order to incorporate air and to prevent large ice crystals from forming. The result is a smoothly textured semi-solid foam that is malleable and can be scooped.The meaning of the phrase "ice cream" varies from one country to another. Phrases such as "frozen custard", "frozen yogurt", "sorbet", "gelato" and others are used to distinguish different varieties and styles. In some countries, such as the United States, the phrase "ice cream" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients.[2] In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes, are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan. The most popular flavours of ice cream are vanilla and chocolate.[3]In the Persian Empire, people would pour grape-juice concentrate over snow, in a bowl, and eat this as a treat, especially when the weather was hot. Snow would either be saved in the cool-keeping underground chambers known as "yakhchal", or taken from snowfall that remained at the top of mountains by the summer capital Hagmatana, Ecbatana or Hamedan of today. In 400 BC, the Persians went further and invented a special chilled food, made of rose water and vermicelli, which was served to royalty during summers.[4] The ice was mixed with saffron, fruits, and various other flavours.Ancient civilizations have served ice for cold foods for thousands of years. The BBC reports that a frozen mixture of milk and rice was used in China around 200 BC.[5] The Roman Emperor Nero (3768) had ice brought from the mountains and combined it with fruit toppings. These were some early chilled delicacies.[6]Arabs were perhaps the first to use milk as a major ingredient in the production of ice cream.[citation needed] They sweetened it with sugar rather than fruit juices, and perfected means of commercial production. As early as the 10th century, ice cream was widespread among many of the Arab world's major cities, including Baghdad, Damascus, and Cairo. It was produced from milk or cream, often with some yoghurt, and was flavoured with rosewater, dried fruits and nuts. It is believed that the recipe was based on older Ancient Arabian recipes, which were, it is presumed, the first and precursors to Persian faloodeh.Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat asserts, in her History of Food, that "the Chinese may be credited with inventing a device to make sorbets and ice cream. They poured a mixture of snow and saltpetre over the exteriors of containers filled with syrup, for, in the same way as salt raises the boiling-point of water, it lowers the freezing-point to below zero."[7][8] Some distorted accounts claim that in the age of Emperor Yingzong, Song Dynasty (960-1279) of China, a poem named Ode to the ice cheese () was written by the poet Yang Wanli. Actually, this poem was named Ode to the pastry (;  is a kind of food much like pastry in the Western world) and has nothing to do with ice cream.[9] It has also been claimed that, in the Yuan Dynasty, Kublai Khan enjoyed ice cream and kept it a royal secret until Marco Polo visited China and took the technique of making ice cream to Italy.In the sixteenth century, the Mughal emperors used relays of horsemen to bring ice from the Hindu Kush to Delhi, where it was used in fruit sorbets.[10]When Italian duchess Catherine de' Medici married the Duke of Orlans (Henry II of France) in 1533, she is said to have brought with her to France some Italian chefs who had recipes for flavoured ices or sorbets.[11] One hundred years later, Charles I of England was, it was reported, so impressed by the "frozen snow" that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for keeping the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal prerogative.[12] There is no historical evidence to support these legends, which first appeared during the 19th century.The first recipe in French for flavoured ices appears in 1674, in Nicholas Lemerys Recueil de curiositz rares et nouvelles de plus admirables effets de la nature.[11] Recipes for sorbetti saw publication in the 1694 edition of Antonio Latini's Lo Scalco alla Moderna (The Modern Steward).[11] Recipes for flavoured ices begin to appear in Franois Massialot's Nouvelle Instruction pour les Confitures, les Liqueurs, et les Fruits, starting with the 1692 edition. Massialot's recipes result in a coarse, pebbly texture. Latini claims that the results of his recipes should have the fine consistency of sugar and snow.[11]Ice cream recipes first appeared in 18th-century England and America. The recipe for ice cream was published in Mrs. Mary Eales's Receipts in London in 1718.[13][14]To ice cream.Take Tin Ice-Pots, fill them with any Sort of Cream you like, either plain or sweetend, or Fruit in it; shut your Pots very close; to six Pots you must allow eighteen or twenty Pound of Ice, breaking the Ice very small; there will be some great Pieces, which lay at the Bottom and Top: You must have a Pail, and lay some Straw at the Bottom; then lay in your Ice, and put in amongst it a Pound of Bay-Salt; set in your Pots of Cream, and 93 lay Ice and Salt between every Pot, that they may not touch; but the Ice must lie round them on every Side; lay a good deal of Ice on the Top, cover the Pail with Straw, set it in a Cellar where no Sun or Light comes, it will be froze in four Hours, but it may stand longer; then take it out just as you use it; hold it in your Hand and it will slip out. When you woud freeze any Sort of Fruit, either Cherries, Rasberries, Currants, or Strawberries, fill your Tin-Pots with the Fruit, but as hollow as you can; put to them Lemmonade, made with Spring-Water and Lemmon-Juice sweetend; put enough in the Pots to make the Fruit hang together, and put them in Ice as you do Cream.The earliest reference to ice cream given by the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1744, reprinted in a magazine in 1877. 1744 in Pennsylvania Mag. Hist. & Biogr. (1877) I. 126 Among the rarities..was some fine ice cream, which, with the strawberries and milk, eat most deliciously.[15]The 1751 edition of The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse features a recipe for ice cream. OED gives her recipe: H. GLASSE Art of Cookery (ed. 4) 333 (heading) To make Ice Cream..set it [sc. the cream] into the larger Bason. Fill it with Ice, and a Handful of Salt.[15]The year 1768 saw the publication of L'Art de Bien Faire les Glaces d'Office by M. Emy, a cookbook devoted entirely to recipes for flavoured ices and ice cream.[11]Ice cream was introduced to the United States by Quaker colonists who brought their ice cream recipes with them. Confectioners sold ice cream at their shops in New York and other cities during the colonial era. Ben Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson were known to have regularly eaten and served ice cream. First Lady Dolley Madison is also closely associated with the early history of ice cream in the United States. One respected history of ice cream states that, as the wife of U.S. President James Madison, she served ice cream at her husband's Inaugural Ball in 1813.Around 1832, Augustus Jackson, an African American confectioner, not only created multiple ice cream recipes but also invented a superior technique to manufacture ice cream.[16]In 1843, Nancy Johnson of Philadelphia was issued the first U.S. patent for a small-scale handcranked ice cream freezer. The invention of the ice cream soda gave Americans a new treat, adding to ice cream's popularity. The invention of this cold treat is attributed to Robert Green in 1874, although there is no conclusive evidence to prove his claim.The ice cream sundae originated in the late 19th century. Several men claimed to have created the first sundae, but there is no conclusive evidence to support any of their stories. Some sources say that the sundae was invented to circumvent blue laws, which forbade serving sodas on Sunday. Towns claiming to be the birthplace of the sundae include Buffalo, Two Rivers, Ithaca, and Evanston. Both the ice cream cone and banana split became popular in the early 20th century. Several food vendors claimed to have invented the ice cream cone at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, MO, USA.[17] Europeans were eating cones long before 1904.[18][19]In the UK, ice cream remained an expensive and rare treat, until large quantities of ice began to be imported from Norway and the US in the mid-Victorian era. A Swiss-Italian businessman, Carlo Gatti, opened the first ice cream stall outside Charing Cross station in 1851, selling scoops of ice cream in shells for one penny.[20]The history of ice cream in the 20th century is one of great change and increases in availability and popularity. In the United States in the early 20th century, the ice cream soda was a popular treat at the soda shop, the soda fountain, and the ice cream parlor. During American Prohibition, the soda fountain to some extent replaced the outlawed alcohol establishments such as bars and saloons.Ice cream became popular throughout the world in the second half of the 20th century after cheap refrigeration became common. There was an explosion of ice cream stores and of flavours and types. Vendors often competed on the basis of variety. Howard Johnson's restaurants advertised "a world of 28 flavors". Baskin-Robbins made its 31 flavours ("one for every day of the month") the cornerstone of its marketing strategy. The company now boasts that it has developed over 1000 varieties.One important development in the 20th century was the introduction of soft ice cream. A chemical research team in Britain (of which a young Margaret Thatcher was a member)[21][22] discovered a method of doubling the amount of air in ice cream, which allowed manufacturers to use less ingredients, thereby reducing costs. It made possible the soft ice cream machine in which a cone is filled beneath a spigot on order. In the United States, Dairy Queen, Carvel, and Tastee-Freez pioneered in establishing chains of soft-serve ice cream outlets.Technological innovations such as these have introduced various food additives into ice cream, the notable one being the stabilizing agent gluten,[23] to which some people have an intolerance. Recent awareness of this issue has prompted a number of manufacturers to start producing gluten-free ice cream.[24]The 1980s saw thicker ice creams being sold as "premium" and "superpremium" varieties under brands such as Ben & Jerry's and Hagen-Dazs.Before the development of modern refrigeration, ice cream was a luxury reserved for special occasions. Making it was quite laborious; ice was cut from lakes and ponds during the winter and stored in holes in the ground, or in wood-frame or brick ice houses, insulated by straw. Many farmers and plantation owners, including U.S. Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, cut and stored ice in the winter for use in the summer. Frederic Tudor of Boston turned ice harvesting and shipping into a big business, cutting ice in New England and shipping it around the world.Ice cream was made by hand in a large bowl placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetire (a covered pail with a handle attached to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature of the ingredients is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.The hand-cranked churn, which also uses ice and salt for cooling, replaced the pot-freezer method. The exact origin of the hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on September 9, 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot freezer and did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.In Europe and early America, ice cream was made and sold by small businesses, mostly confectioners and caterers. Jacob Fussell of Baltimore, Maryland was the first to manufacture ice cream on a large scale. Fussell bought fresh dairy products from farmers in York County, Pennsylvania, and sold them in Baltimore. An unstable demand for his dairy products often left him with a surplus of cream, which he made into ice cream. He built his first ice cream factory in Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, in 1851. Two years later, he moved his factory to Baltimore. Later, he opened factories in several other cities and taught the business to others, who operated their own plants. Mass production reduced the cost of ice cream and added to its popularity.The development of industrial refrigeration by German engineer Carl von Linde during the 1870s eliminated the need to cut and store natural ice, and, when the continuous-process freezer was perfected in 1926, commercial mass production of ice cream and the birth of the modern ice cream industry was underway.The most common method for producing ice cream at home is to use an ice cream maker, in modern times, in general, an electrical device that churns the ice cream mixture while cooled inside a household freezer, or using a solution of pre-frozen salt and water, which gradually melts while the ice cream freezes. Some more expensive models have an inbuilt freezing element. A newer method of making home-made ice cream is to add liquid nitrogen to the mixture while stirring it using a spoon or spatula. Some ice cream recipes call for making a custard, folding in whipped cream, and immediately freezing the mixture.Ice cream can be mass-produced and thus is widely available in developed parts of the world. Ice cream can be purchased in large cartons (vats and squrounds) from supermarkets and grocery stores, in smaller quantities from ice cream shops, convenience stores, and milk bars, and in individual servings from small carts or vans at public events. In Turkey and Australia, ice cream is sometimes sold to beach-goers from small powerboats equipped with chest freezers. Some ice cream distributors sell ice cream products from traveling refrigerated vans or carts (commonly referred to in the US as "ice cream trucks"), sometimes equipped with speakers playing children's music. Ice cream vans in the United Kingdom make a music box noise rather than actual music.In the USA, ice cream may have the following composition:[25]These compositions are percentage by weight. Since ice cream can contain as much as half air by volume, these numbers may be reduced by as much as half if cited by volume. In terms of dietary considerations, the percentages by weight are more relevant. Even the low-fat products have high caloric content: Ben and Jerry's No-Fat Vanilla Fudge contains 150 calories (630kJ) per half-cup due to its high sugar content.[26]Mrs Marshall's Cookery Book, published in 1888, endorsed serving ice cream in cones,[27] but the idea definitely predated that. Agnes Marshall was a celebrated cookery writer of her day and helped to popularise ice cream. She patented and manufactured an ice cream maker and was the first person to suggest using liquefied gases to freeze ice cream after seeing a demonstration at the Royal Institution.Reliable evidence proves that ice cream cones were served in the 19th century, and their popularity increased greatly during the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. According to legend, at the World's Fair an ice cream seller had run out of the cardboard dishes used to put ice cream scoops in, so they could not sell any more produce. Next door to the ice cream booth was a Syrian waffle booth, unsuccessful due to intense heat; the waffle maker offered to make cones by rolling up his waffles and the new product sold well, and was widely copied by other vendors.[28][29]The following is a partial list of ice cream-like frozen desserts and snacks:Using liquid nitrogen to freeze ice cream is an old idea and has been used for many years to harden ice cream. The use of liquid nitrogen in the primary freezing of ice cream, that is to effect the transition from the liquid to the frozen state without the use of a conventional ice cream freezer, has only recently started to see commercialization. Some commercial innovations have been documented in the National Cryogenic Society Magazine "Cold Facts".[32] The most noted brands are Dippin' Dots,[33] Blue Sky Creamery,[34] Project Creamery,[35] and Sub Zero Cryo Creamery.[36] The preparation results in a column of white condensed water vapor cloud, reminiscent of popular depictions of witches' cauldrons. The ice cream, dangerous to eat while still "steaming", is allowed to rest until the liquid nitrogen is completely vaporised. Sometimes ice cream is frozen to the sides of the container, and must be allowed to thaw.Making ice cream with liquid nitrogen has advantages over conventional freezing. Due to the rapid freezing, the crystal grains are smaller, giving the ice cream a creamier texture, and allowing one to get the same texture by using less milkfat. Such ice crystals will grow very quickly via the processes of recrystallization, thereby obviating the original benefits unless steps are taken to inhibit ice crystal growth.For similar reasons, good results can also be achieved with the more readily available "dry ice" and authors such as Heston Blumenthal have published recipes to produce ice cream and sorbet using a simple blender.[37]1 History2 Production3 Commercial delivery4 Dietary5 Ice cream around the world6 Ice cream cone7 Other frozen desserts8 Cryogenic9 See also10 References11 External linksgreater than 10% milkfat and usually between 10% and as high as 16% fat in some premium ice creams9 to 12% milk solids-not-fat: this component, also known as the serum solids, contains the proteins (caseins and whey proteins) and carbohydrates (lactose) found in milk12 to 16% sweeteners: usually a combination of sucrose and glucose-based corn syrup sweeteners0.2 to 0.5% stabilisers and emulsifiers55% to 64% water, which comes from the milk or other ingredients.Ais kacang: a dessert in Malaysia and Singapore made from shaved ice, syrup, and boiled red bean and topped with evaporated milk.

Abigail "Abby" Sciuto (/uto/) is a fictional character from the NCIS television series by CBS Television, and is portrayed by Pauley Perrette. Like Jethro Gibbs, Anthony DiNozzo, and Dr. Donald Mallard, Abby was first introduced in the episodes "Ice Queen" and "Meltdown" (which together served as the backdoor pilot for NCIS) in the television show JAG, and has appeared in every episode of NCIS, in addition to being featured on the show's spin-off, NCIS: Los Angeles. The role has made Perrette the most popular actress on U.S. primetime television,[1] according to Q Score.Abby Sciuto is a forensic specialist at the Naval Criminal Investigative Service headquarters at the Washington Naval Yard, with expertise in ballistics, digital forensics, and DNA analysis. In the first episode for season 7, "Truth or Consequences", DiNozzo, while under the influence of a truth serum, describes her as "a paradox wrapped in an oxymoron smothered in contradictions in terms. Sleeps in a coffin. Really, the happiest goth you'll ever meet."[2] Her gothic style of dress and her interest in death and the supernatural enigmatically contrast with her generally hyperactive demeanor and enthusiasm about her work. AOL named her as number 95 on a list of the 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.[3]Abby has a gothic style of dress, including black dresses and t-shirts, mini-skirts, and goth jewelry, including anklets and toe rings. She wears pigtailed dyed hair (due to Perrette's hair being dyed as she is a natural blonde[4]), and has at least eleven tattoos on her neck, arms, back, ankle and other places. Her neck choker is one of her favourite pieces of jewelry. While some of the tattoos are Perrette's and real, others are makeup, such as the large cross on her back applied on occasions when Perrette shows her bare back on camera.[5] The spider web on her neck is not real either, as producer Donald Bellisario wanted the character to have a tattoo that would be visible (almost) all the time. However Perrette has expressed dislike for the spider tattoo and wishes for an episode where Abby gets it removed but so far, that hasn't happened.[5] Abby also has a stuffed hippo named "Bert" that makes flatulence noises when squeezed, which has been used for comic effect when Abby is upset. She decorates some of the areas in her lab with toys such as 'Bleeding Edge Goth' dolls and 'Teddy Scares.' The Teddy Scare 'Rita Mortis' can be seen sitting next to her computer monitor. Abby's biggest pet peeve, as revealed in Season 5's "Lost and Found" by Timothy McGee, is people who claim to be vegetarians but still eat chicken; her second biggest pet peeve is people who mishandle evidence.Abby drives a candy-apple red Ford '32 Deuce Coupe bearing a Washington, D.C. personalized vanity plate "4NS CHIK" which is prominently featured in Season 5's "Dog Tags".[6] She previously drove a hearse (mentioned in "Hiatus, Part I"), which ran poorly and had bald tires.Like Gibbs, Abby enjoys caffeine, primarily in the form of large cups of a fictional drink called "Caf-Pow." At times, when she is worried about the caffeine interfering with her sleep, she drinks "No-Caf-Pow" instead. (According to Perrette, the cups were originally filled with Hawaiian Punch, but when she stopped eating and drinking refined sugar, unsweetened cranberry juice was used instead.)[7] When changing the artwork in her lab during "Hung Out to Dry", she states that she has a "Chagall feeling", a reference to Marc Chagall, a Jewish Belarusian artist whose main works came from fantasy and dreams. Her favorite term for something out of the ordinary is "hinky". It is also shown that she enjoys attending concerts, but her failure to wear earplugs at one of them left her with temporary hearing loss the next day, forcing her to ask DiNozzo for help analyzing some audio evidence.[8]Abby has shown a tendency to become very agitated, to the point of near-panic, if any of the team are seriously hurt. When Gibbs was admitted to hospital, Abby ended up on the verge of a nervous breakdown, pacing back and forth while delivering a rambling, disjointed stream-of-consciousness plea that explained (among other things) how close she and Gibbs were, the reason she was arriving after visiting hours, how she felt about Gibbs being injured, and how important it was to her that Gibbs not die from his injuries.Abby developed a fondness for Butch, a Navy sniffer dog, in the season 5 episode "Dog Tags". She renamed it "Jethro" after Gibbs, because it was "handsome and quiet" like him. The dog was framed for the murder of a petty officer as the dog was found at the murder victim's house, but Abby proved Jethro's innocence. Afterwards, Abby forced McGee to adopt the dog, much to his dismay (as Jethro had attacked him earlier in the episode). Abby would have preferred to adopt Jethro herself, but her landlord did not allow tenants to have pets.Sciuto is well-versed in her field of study; she is rarely stumped by the puzzles that Gibbs' team present to her. Abby has been shown to have skills in traditional forensics, computer forensics, and hacking. She has implied that she has a PhD in chemistry.[9] It has been shown that she does all the work on the evidence herself. In season 3, when she was given an assistant, Charles "Chip" Sterling, she revolted but eventually learned to put up with him. However their working partnership did not last long as Abby later discovered Sterling had framed DiNozzo for murder. Exposed, Chip threatened her with a knife; she promptly subdued him, hog-tied him with duct tape, and insisted on being allowed to work alone from then on, something Jenny Shepard agreed to.It has been shown that she has a younger brother, Luca,[10] and niece.[11] She also mentioned that her grandmother was an Olympic swimmer who won a silver medal[12] and that she had an uncle named Teddy who owned a bar.[13]She also has an Uncle named Horace whom she referred to as Horace "the Haggler" during an episode. It has also been mentioned numerous times that she is a devout Roman Catholic and is on a bowling team with several nuns.In "Kill Ari Part 2" at Kate Todd's funeral, it is revealed Abby grew up in New Orleans.In the episode "Seadog", Gibbs tells Tony that Abby knows how to use sign language because both of her parents were deaf.It was stated in the NCIS: Los Angeles episode "Random On Purpose", Abby is in her late 20s.Abby is a hearing child adopted by deaf parents[14] and likes her music loud. Abby has stated that she dreams of visiting the Galpagos Islands, Dollywood, and Israel before she dies.[15] Abby graduated with full honors from LSU with a triple major in sociology, criminology and psychology. She earned her master's degree from Georgia State University in criminology and forensic science. Sciuto's interest in forensics came from living near a wrecking yard and being intrigued by the cause and effect of the wrecks.[15][16] The season 9 episode "Enemy on the Hill" revealed that Abby has another brother, Kyle (played by Daniel Louis Rivas), who is her biological brother, as it is revealed that Abby is in fact adopted.[17]Abby gets along well with all the rest of the team. She is very fond of Ducky, who uses her full name, Abigail. (She is called Abby or Abbs by most everyone else, except Director Leon Vance, who calls her Ms. Sciuto.) Abby is fiercely loyal to the team, and considers them family which is shown by her distress when one or more of them is in serious danger.Abby's relationship with Tony is a friendly one, with the two making friendly, non-hostile jibes at each other, and squabbling about various topics, such as movies and personal possessions. Abby is perhaps the only member of the NCIS cast who displays a love and knowledge of movies that even comes close to matching Tony's. In "Twilight," after Tony narrowly avoids being part of an explosion on his first day back from sick leave after getting pneumonic plague, she runs at him and hugs him so hard he nearly falls over. In the episode, "Frame-Up," she almost single-handedly unravels the forensic evidence used to frame Tony of murder in order to clear his name, then subdues the killer  her assistant  when he threatens her with a knife. The explosion of Tony's car in "Bury Your Dead" causes her to become increasingly obsessed with her work, in order to prevent thoughts of his possible death. In "Reunion," after Tony, McGee and Gibbs rescue Ziva from Somalia, Abby starts with a rant criticizing Ziva for her continuing mistrust of Tony, which, in trademark Abby fashion, ends with her saying how worried she was about Ziva, and hugging her. This then sparks a confrontation between Tony and Ziva that sees their relationship restored to normal.Before her death in the line of duty, Special Agent Caitlin Todd was a close friend of Abby's. They often hung out after work, and Abby is one of the few to know what Kate's tattoo actually is. Abby was at first cold to Ziva David when the latter first arrived at NCIS, as she was the half-sister of Ari, who killed Todd. Abby would scribble over pictures of Ziva and frequently mispronounce her surname to annoy her. Later, upset by Ziva's calm response to Gibbs being injured in a bombing, Abby slapped her. Abby eventually came around, and she and Ziva became good friends. This was solidified in the episode "Capitol Offense" when Ziva, in gratitude for Abby allowing her to stay at her place (Ziva's home was being fumigated for termites), bought her a "chocoholic's choice" cupcake. The cupcake soon vanished, and Abby brought out all her forensic know-how to find it. Ultimately, it was McGee who had taken the cupcake, angering Abby and the others. At first, Ziva flinched whenever Abby would hug her given that she did not know why Abby did so, but eventually, she overcame this, and Ziva now accepts Abby's hugs with no problems.She is friendly with Medical Assistant Jimmy Palmer. She has helped him with an autopsy and "Rolfed" him when he injured himself in the morgue in "Life Before His Eyes". In "Newborn King", Palmer brings his future father in-law, Ed Slater, to NCIS. Later in the episode McGee visits Abby to see she has locked the two in the back room. Jimmy states if Slater hadn't made a comment about Abby's tattoo then they wouldn't be in time out, implying he took Abby's side. Jimmy also chose Abby to be his Best Woman at his wedding in "The Missionary Position".Abby and Gibbs have a very strong bond. Abby is one of only two characters (the other one being Ducky) to have no fear of him. Gibbs is often seen giving Abby kisses on the cheek, and hugging her, especially when she does good work on the cases she works on. Sometimes, he even massages her shoulders. He often brings her a fresh Caf-Pow when he arrives at the lab for information on a case, whether or not she has called him down to tell him about it. Gibbs generally tolerates Abby's goth dress style, knowing that she does a great job in her work, but often has to ask her to get to the point when she starts rambling. Abby sometimes turns to Gibbs when she needs to talk about something personal that is bothering her and he helps by listening to her. Both Gibbs and Abby are proficient with American Sign Language, as Abby grew up with deaf parents. On several occasions, Abby has been described as "the favorite", a fact that does not escape the rest of the team, but they do not begrudge her for it.Gibbs is also very protective of Abby, especially when she is in very serious danger. For example, in the episode "Bloodbath", she was threatened by a hit man hired by a defendant in a case in which she was testifying, which was also complicated by an ex-boyfriend, Mikel Mawher[18] (guest star, Vincent Young), against whom she had a restraining order, but who then called her in violation of the order. When Gibbs found out about this, he pointedly told Mikel, "The only reason you're still able to walk is because I never heard about you until today!"[19]Sometimes, that protectiveness extends from the rest of the team as well. For example in the episode "Spider and the Fly", Alejandro Rivera came to NCIS and began to threaten Abby for not sending in a report about the murder of Pedro Hernandez, Rivera's father, whom Gibbs had killed twenty years previously in revenge for Hernandez killing Gibbs' first wife, Shannon, and young daughter, Kelly. The entire team, including Ducky and Vance, ordered him to leave her alone and to not harass her, or to be escorted forcibly from NCIS Headquarters. Rivera eventually left of his own accord, but was later arrested for attempting to kill Gibbs and his father at a safehouse, and accidentally killing his sister, Paloma.Gibbs' concern for Abby's safety is such that he will even drop his trademark cup of coffee if she is in serious danger. Twice this occurred: in the episode "Kill Ari" when Ari shot at her while she was in her lab, the other time was in the episode "Driven" when she was trapped inside an experimental Humvee, which had been rigged to fill with exhaust fumes and suffocate its occupants.She had a relationship with McGee which she stated that she would like to keep casual during season 1. Although the relationship ended late in the same season, they both have exhibited jealousy when someone of the opposite sex pays attention to the other. There continues to be some erotic teasing and tension between the two, implied through such facts as McGee's apparent ability to describe the inside of Abby's bedroom in his novel. After finding out Abby sleeps in a coffin, he said, "You told me it was a box sofa," indicating he has at least stayed over. The implications went farther when he added, "I can't believe I slept in a coffin," and she impishly replied, "Not just slept." In the episode "Bloodbath" when Abby's life is threatened and the team sends her home with McGee, it is revealed at one point Abby kept a toothbrush at McGee's apartment.In the NCIS: Los Angeles episode "Random on Purpose", Abby, having been previously seen on video-conference or talking to someone from her lab in Washington D.C, arrived in Los Angeles to meet the OSP team as she informed them she was investigating a serial killer called the Phantom who had murdered 15 people all over the country and had also left no DNA or even physical evidence at the scenes.Having already formed a strong friendship with Eric Beale, Abby developed friendships with the Office of Special Projects (OSP) team, including G. Callen (Chris O'Donnell); Sam Hanna (LL Cool J); and most notably the operations manager Hetty Lange (Linda Hunt) who commented that Abby is "the first NCIS employee [she] has ever met with a sense of style".[20] Abby was later kidnapped by the Phantom, later revealed to be a law firm receptionist named Tom Smith who sought to kill her to keep his identity a secret as he hoped to go around, killing more people, having developed something of a taste for it.Kensi Blye, another NCIS Special Agent who is an expert in forensics praised Abby for her high levels of thinking, stating that she lived up to the hype.Although Vance mentioned that Gibbs and the NCIS MCRT team were en route to Los Angeles to rescue her, Abby was saved thanks to the efforts of the OSP team and was later seen telling Gibbs and McGee on a video-conferencing link that she was okay although their faces and voices were not shown.To date, Abby has not returned to Los Angeles nor has she reappeared in any video-conference calls which strongly suggests that her appearances in Season 1 were just a one-off. It could also be presumed that due to what happened to her in LA and for security reasons, Gibbs and Vance are unwilling to let her return to LA by herself.1 Personality2 Background3 Relationships

NCIS, formerly known as NCIS: Naval Criminal Investigative Service, is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.The concept and characters were initially introduced in two episodes of the CBS series JAG (season eight episodes "Ice Queen" and "Meltdown"). The show, a spin-off from JAG, premiered on September 23, 2003 on CBS and, to date, has aired nine full seasons and has gone into syndicated reruns on USA Network, Cloo (formerly Sleuth), and Ion Television. Donald Bellisario is co-creator, along with Don McGill, as well as executive producer.NCIS was originally referred to as Navy NCIS during season one; "Navy" was later dropped from the title as it was redundant. In season seven, NCIS was joined by a spin-off series, NCIS: Los Angeles, starring Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J.In 2011, NCIS was voted Americas favorite television show.[1] On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed NCIS for a 10th season[2] which premiered on September 25, 2012.[3] Brian Dietzen was also promoted to series regular for season ten.[4]NCIS follows a fictional team of Naval Criminal Investigative Service Major Case Response Team (MCRT)[5] special agents headquartered at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. It is described by the actors and producers (on special features on DVD releases in the United States) as being distinguished by its comedic elements, ensemble acting, and character-driven plots.NCIS is the primary law enforcement and counter-intelligence arm of the United States Department of the Navy, which includes the United States Marine Corps. NCIS investigates all major criminal offenses (felonies)i.e., crimes punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice by confinement of more than one yearwithin the Department of the Navy. The MCRT is frequently assigned to high-profile cases such as the death of the U.S. president's military aide, a bomb situation on a U.S. Navy warship, the death of a celebrity on a reality show set on a US Marine Corps base, terrorist threats involving U.S Naval and Marine weapons and/or Naval or Marine installations, and kidnappings of Navy and Marine Corps personnel.The MCRT is led by Supervisory Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon). Gibbss team is composed of Special Agent and Senior Field Agent Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Special Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), and Special Agent (former Mossad liaison officer) Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), who replaced Caitlin "Kate" Todd (Sasha Alexander) when she was shot and killed by rogue Mossad agent Ari Haswari (Rudolf Martin) at the end of season two. The team is assisted in their investigations by Chief Medical Examiner Donald "Ducky" Mallard (David McCallum), his assistant Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen), who replaced Gerald Jackson (Pancho Demmings), and Forensic Specialist Abigail "Abby" Sciuto (Pauley Perrette).It is revealed, through flashbacks, that the head of the MCRT before Gibbs was Special Agent Mike Franks (Muse Watson), who led the unit when it was part of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS), the predecessor agency of the NCIS. Franks recruited Gibbs shortly after Gibbs' retirement from the Marine Corps, eventually retiring himself some years later. After Franks' departure, Gibbs recruited DiNozzo from the Baltimore Police Department's Homicide Section. The two were briefly joined by Vivian Blackadder (Robyn Lively), whom Gibbs recruited from the FBI. In the second part of the NCIS pilot, Blackadder allowed her emotions to nearly derail an anti-terror operation in Spain. Gibbs is noticeably disappointed; Blackadder is not present in the series' first regular episode, replaced by Caitlin Todd, a Secret Service agent who joins Gibbs' team after resigning from the Secret Service. Todd is eventually killed in the line of duty in the season two finale, and is ultimately replaced by Ziva David, who from season three to season seven is the Mossad liaison officer who eventually gains American citizenship and becomes a full agent. McGee first appears as a Field Agent assigned to the Norfolk Field Office. He uses his computer skills to aid the MCRT in subsequent investigations through the rest of season one, until he is officially promoted with his own desk at the Navy Yard in the beginning of season two.NCIS is currently led by Director Leon Vance (Rocky Carroll). The first director seen in the series, Thomas Morrow (Alan Dale), left after being promoted to Deputy Director of the Department of Homeland Security. Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) was appointed director after Morrow in the first episode of season three, the first NCIS director to be in the regular series cast list. After Shepard was killed in a shootout at the end of season five, Vancewho was assistant director of NCIS before her deathwas seen as acting director after her death and was promoted to take her place.Prior to the launch of the first season, advertisements on CBS identified the show as "Naval CIS". By the time of the launch of the first episode, NCIS was airing under the name Navy NCIS, the name it held for the entire first season. Since the "N" in NCIS stands for "Naval", the name "Navy NCIS" was technically redundant. The decision to use this name was reportedly made by CBS, over the objections of Bellisario, in order to:After its successful first season, the name of the series was shortened to NCIS.NCIS is set in the Washington, D.C. area but is filmed in Santa Clarita, California.[15] The sound stages are in Santa Clarita. The series is shot throughout southern California.It was reported in May 2007 that Donald Bellisario would be stepping down from the show.[16] Due to a disagreement with series star Mark Harmon, Bellisario's duties as showrunner/head writer were to be tasked to long-time show collaborators, including co-executive producer Chas. Floyd Johnson and Shane Brennan, with Bellisario retaining his title as executive producer.[17] In fall 2009,[clarification needed] Gary Glasberg joined the crew and became the new "day-to-day" runner of NCIS, as Shane Brennan had to focus on his new show, the spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles.[18]Nine complete seasons of NCIS have aired, with the ninth season ending on May 15, 2012. The tenth season premiered on September 25, 2012.[19] As of November 27, 2012(2012 -11-27)[update], 218 original episodes of NCIS have aired.Crossover appearances with other CBS shows:Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of NCIS.The first eight seasons of NCIS have been released in Regions 1, 2 and 4. In Germany (Region 2), seasons 14 and 68 were released in two separate sets for each season. The first season DVD omits the two introductory episodes from season eight of JAG, though they are featured on the JAG season eight DVD.In 2010, CBS Interactive and GameHouse released a mobile video game, NCIS: The Game for iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, and BREW/J2ME. The game features five different cases written by the show's writers.[70]On November 1, 2011, Ubisoft released NCIS, a video game for the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii. A Nintendo 3DS version was released on March 6, 2012. The video game was deemed as a mockery to the show by reviewers and players alike, and received a 2/10 rating on GameSpot.[71]CBS Records released the show's first soundtrack on February 10, 2009.[72] The Official TV Soundtrack is a two-disc, 22-track set that includes brand new songs from top artists featured prominently in upcoming episodes of the series as well as the shows original theme by Numeriklab[73] (available commercially for the first time) and a remix of the theme by Ministry. The set also includes songs performed by series regulars Pauley Perrette and Cote de Pablo.A sequel to the soundtrack was released on November 3, 2009. NCIS: The Official TV Soundtrack; Vol. 2 is a single disc, 12 track set that covers songs (many previously unreleased) featured throughout the seventh season of the show, including one recording titled "Bitter and Blue" by Weatherly, as well as two songs used in previous seasons.In 2009, CBS picked up an NCIS spin-off series with the title NCIS: Los Angeles.[74][75][76][77] Filming began in February 2009, with the characters introduced in a two-part NCIS episode entitled "Legend" which aired on April 28, 2009 and May 5, 2009.[75] The characters listed were: G. Callen, Lara Macy, Nate "Doc" Getz, Kensi Blye, and Sam Hanna.[78] Crew members include Michael B. Kaplan, Lev L. Spiro, Jerry London, Sheldon Epps, and Mark Saraceni.[79]Chris O'Donnell plays the lead character of G. Callen.[80] LL Cool J, plays the role of Special Agent Sam Hanna, a former Navy SEAL, who works in the undercover unit of NCIS in Los Angeles, and is also fluent in Arabic and an expert on Middle Eastern culture."[76] Peter Cambor and Daniela Ruah were confirmed to be cast as leads, playing a psychologist (called "Nate") and forensic investigator/undercover agent (called "Kensi") respectively.[78]Following the shows official pick up, Louise Lombard was not signed for the role of Special Agent Lara Macy, that she had played in the pilot. Linda Hunt and Adam Jamal Craig were confirmed to replace her, playing OSP Manager Henrietta Lange and Special Agent Dom Vail, both starring roles. Craig left the series in episode 21 of season 1, was replaced by Eric Christian Olsen playing Marty Deeks,[81] the LAPD/NCIS Liaison and Kensi's partner.Characters from NCIS have appeared in the spin-off; Leon Vance has a recurring role and Abby Sciuto appeared in the episodes "Random on Purpose" and "Killshot".NCIS: Los Angeles is created by Shane Brennan. NCIS creator Donald Bellisario sued CBS over NCIS: Los Angeles in April 2011 because of his "first opportunity" to develop a spin-off, which according to the sue Bellisario wasn't offered from CBS.[82] In June 2012 a Court judge dismissed Bellisario's sue.[83]ALMA AwardASCAP AwardBMI Film & TV AwardsCalifornia on Location AwardsEmmy AwardsNAACP Image AwardsPeople's Choice AwardsImagen Foundation AwardsYoung Artist AwardsNCIS at TV.comPolice proceduralDramaDonald P.

He was a sniper in the United States Marine Corps, achieving the rank of gunnery sergeant, until 1991 when his first wife Shannon and daughter Kelly were killed by a Mexican drug dealer.[9] Gibbs killed the drug dealer in Mexico, after being told by Special Agent Mike Franks where to find him, and joined NIS, later renamed NCIS, initially training under Franks.[10] After Franks' retirement, Gibbs became the agent in charge of the MCRT. He has been married four times, but is currently single, which is often referred to on the show. He also has a difficult relationship with his father. Gibbs and Director Shepard had a romantic relationship in the past, shown through the use of flashbacks. He is seen as somewhat of a fatherly figure to Abby and later to Ziva. Due to his senior status at NCIS, he has also carried out tasks at a higher level, such as becoming a temporary acting director for the entire agency.Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly) is the senior field agent of the Major Case Response Team at NCIS. He is a former Peoria, Philadelphia, and Baltimore police officer and detective. After working on a case with Gibbs while he was a detective with Baltimore PD, he discovered his best friend and partner was a dirty cop and quit from the police and joined NCIS in 2001.[11] Ducky considers DiNozzo to be a younger version of Gibbs, using his "gut" to solve cases (e.g., in the episode "Collateral Damage").[12] Considered a notorious womanizer, his behavior even irritates the females he works with, although his behavior has been shown to change as the character developed. DiNozzo is a movie expert and sometimes his expert knowledge can irritate his coworkers.Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) is a Special Agent on the Major Case Response Team since season seven. For her first four years in the show, she was a part of the NCIS team as a Mossad Liaison Officer. David replaced Special Agent Kate Todd, who was killed by David's half-brother, Ari. She later killed Ari to save Gibbs' life; by doing so she earned Gibbs' trust. In the season seven premiere, "Truth or Consequences", David is rescued from North Africa by Gibbs, DiNozzo, and McGee, where she had been held captive during a mission for Mossad. David eventually returned to the U.S. and resigned from Mossad, becoming a probationary NCIS agent and a US citizen, and (in the season nine premiere) a full-fledged agent.Abigail "Abby" Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) is a forensics specialist working with the Major Case Response Team. She has an affinity for goth fashion and a passion for Caf-Pow, a fictional high caffeine beverage.

He has a degree in computer forensics from MIT and a degree in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins, and, along with Abby Sciuto (with whom he was briefly intimate and remains close friends), acts as the team's technology specialist. McGee was originally assigned to the Norfolk Naval Base, but became a permanent team member at the end of the season two opening episode, "See No Evil". Often called "Probie" by DiNozzo, despite no longer being a probationary. Under the pseudonym Thom E. Gemcity he is also the author of a best-selling book using characters based on members of the team.Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen; seasons 1present) replaced Gerald Jackson as the assistant to Dr. Mallard.

Initially working as a United States Secret Service agent, she was offered a job at NCIS by Gibbs. She was killed in the season two finale, "Twilight", after being shot in the head by double agent Ari Haswari (Ziva David's half-brother).Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) was director of NCIS for seasons three to five and formerly Gibbs' partner (and lover). She was killed in the season five finale, "Judgment Day", at a deserted restaurant in the middle of a desert.Tobias Fornell, portrayed by Joe Spano (seasons 1present), is a senior FBI Special Agent. He has a daughter with his ex-wife, who was previously married to Gibbs. Gibbs and Fornell have a spiky camaraderie and frequently have meetings in a stopped elevator while pretending to their respective staffs they are furiously arguing. In fact, after sharing a somewhat adversarial relationship early on, the two now share a close friendship.Mike Franks, portrayed by Muse Watson (seasons 38), was a retired special agent with NIS and long-time mentor to Gibbs, whom he still calls Probie. He is also close friends with DiNozzo and Jenny Shepard. He loses his trigger finger in "Rule Fifty-one" but claims that he "can still pull the trigger with [his] thumb." In the season eight episode "Swan Song," he is murdered with a scalpel by Lt. Jonas Cobb, the "Port to Port Killer", though he appears in the episode as a ghost-like figure who interacts with Gibbs in Gibbs' memories as he recalls the events leading up to Franks' murder. In the season nine episode "Life Before His Eyes" Franks appears in Gibbs' hallucination.Trent Kort, portrayed by David Dayan Fisher (seasons 48), is an undercover CIA special agent who always seems to have his own devious goals to pursue. Gibbs regards him as very dangerous and does not trust him. While trying to clean up the agency's mess involving the "Port-to-Port Killer ", Lt. Jonas Cobb, he loses his left eye in a fight with Cobb. After Cobb is taken care of, Ziva's boyfriend, CIA Agent Ray Cruz, is ordered to "handle" Kort in Tel Aviv.Eli David, portrayed by Michael Nouri (seasons 6present), is the director of the national intelligence agency of Israel, the Mossad. He is also father of both NCIS (and ex-Mossad) Agent Ziva David and rogue Mossad double agent Ari Haswari.

J. Barrett, portrayed by Sarah Jane Morris (season 89), is a Special Agent with NCIS and formerly a team leader.

Jones (season 9), a young probationary agent who works with Gibbs' team. He is used by a home grown terrorist named Harper Dearing (Richard Schiff) who is getting revenge on NCIS.

He is mentioned frequently by her prior to his first appearance in "Two-Faced"; he works for the CIA, and is thus nicknamed "C-I-Ray" by DiNozzo. He is Special Agent Barrett's contact on the investigation into the Port-to-Port killer, something he withheld from Ziva, and which prompts her to leave him, albeit temporarily. In "Pyramid", he is seemingly targeted by the Port-to-Port killer, Lt. Jonas Cobb.

An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is a vital component of the system software in a computer system. Application programs usually require an operating system to function.Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,[1][2] although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and will frequently make a system call to an OS function or be interrupted by it. Operating systems can be found on almost any device that contains a computerfrom cellular phones and video game consoles to supercomputers and web servers.Examples of popular modern operating systems include Android, BSD, iOS, Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows,[3] Windows Phone, and IBM z/OS. All these, except Windows and z/OS, share roots in UNIX.Early computers were built to perform a series of single tasks, like a calculator. Operating systems did not exist in their modern and more complex forms until the early 1960s.[4] Basic operating system features were developed in the 1950s, such as resident monitor functions that could automatically run different programs in succession to speed up processing. Hardware features were added that enabled use of runtime libraries, interrupts, and parallel processing. When personal computers became popular in the 1980s, operating system were made for them similar in concept to those used on larger computers.In the 1940s, the earliest electronic digital systems had no operating systems. Electronic systems of this time were programmed on rows of mechanical switches or by jumper wires on plug boards. These were special-purpose systems that, for example, generated ballistics tables for the military or controlled the printing of payroll checks from data on punched paper cards. After programmable general purpose computers were invented, machine languages (consisting of strings of the binary digits 0 and 1 on punched paper tape) were introduced that sped up the programming process (Stern, 1981).In the early 1950s, a computer could execute only one program at a time. Each user had sole use of the computer for a limited period of time and would arrive at a scheduled time with program and data on punched paper cards and/or punched tape. The program would be loaded into the machine, and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using toggle switches and panel lights. It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine, and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the Universal Turing machine.[4]Later machines came with libraries of programs, which would be linked to a user's program to assist in operations such as input and output and generating computer code from human-readable symbolic code. This was the genesis of the modern-day computer system. However, machines still ran a single job at a time. At Cambridge University in England the job queue was at one time a washing line from which tapes were hung with different colored clothes-pegs to indicate job-priority.[citation needed]Through the 1950s, many major features were pioneered in the field of operating systems, including batch processing, input/output interrupt, buffering, multitasking, spooling, runtime libraries, link-loading, and programs for sorting records in files. These features were included or not included in application software at the option of application programmers, rather than in a separate operating system used by all applications. In 1959 the SHARE Operating System was released as an integrated utility for the IBM 704, and later in the 709 and 7090 mainframes, although it was quickly supplanted by IBSYS/IBJOB on the 709, 7090 and 7094.During the 1960s, IBM's OS/360 introduced the concept of a single OS spanning an entire product line, which was crucial for the success of the System/360 machines. IBM's current mainframe operating systems are distant descendants of this original system and applications written for OS/360 can still be run on modern machines.[citation needed]OS/360 also pioneered the concept that the operating system keeps track of all of the system resources that are used, including program and data space allocation in main memory and file space in secondary storage, and file locking during update. When the process is terminated for any reason, all of these resources are re-claimed by the operating system.The alternative CP-67 system for the S/360-67 started a whole line of IBM operating systems focused on the concept of virtual machines. Other operating systems used on IBM S/360 series mainframes included systems developed by IBM: COS/360 (Compatibility Operating System), DOS/360 (Disk Operating System), TSS/360 (Time Sharing System), TOS/360 (Tape Operating System), BOS/360 (Basic Operating System), and ACP (Airline Control Program), as well as a few non-IBM systems: MTS (Michigan Terminal System), MUSIC (Multi-User System for Interactive Computing), and ORVYL (Stanford Timesharing System).Control Data Corporation developed the SCOPE operating system in the 1960s, for batch processing. In cooperation with the University of Minnesota, the Kronos and later the NOS operating systems were developed during the 1970s, which supported simultaneous batch and timesharing use. Like many commercial timesharing systems, its interface was an extension of the Dartmouth BASIC operating systems, one of the pioneering efforts in timesharing and programming languages. In the late 1970s, Control Data and the University of Illinois developed the PLATO operating system, which used plasma panel displays and long-distance time sharing networks. Plato was remarkably innovative for its time, featuring real-time chat, and multi-user graphical games. Burroughs Corporation introduced the B5000 in 1961 with the MCP, (Master Control Program) operating system. The B5000 was a stack machine designed to exclusively support high-level languages with no machine language or assembler, and indeed the MCP was the first OS to be written exclusively in a high-level language  ESPOL, a dialect of ALGOL. MCP also introduced many other ground-breaking innovations, such as being the first commercial implementation of virtual memory. During development of the AS400, IBM made an approach to Burroughs to licence MCP to run on the AS400 hardware. This proposal was declined by Burroughs management to protect its existing hardware production. MCP is still in use today in the Unisys ClearPath/MCP line of computers.UNIVAC, the first commercial computer manufacturer, produced a series of EXEC operating systems. Like all early main-frame systems, this was a batch-oriented system that managed magnetic drums, disks, card readers and line printers. In the 1970s, UNIVAC produced the Real-Time Basic (RTB) system to support large-scale time sharing, also patterned after the Dartmouth BC system.General Electric and MIT developed General Electric Comprehensive Operating Supervisor (GECOS), which introduced the concept of ringed security privilege levels. After acquisition by Honeywell it was renamed to General Comprehensive Operating System (GCOS).Digital Equipment Corporation developed many operating systems for its various computer lines, including TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 time sharing systems for the 36-bit PDP-10 class systems. Prior to the widespread use of UNIX, TOPS-10 was a particularly popular system in universities, and in the early ARPANET community.In the late 1960s through the late 1970s, several hardware capabilities evolved that allowed similar or ported software to run on more than one system. Early systems had utilized microprogramming to implement features on their systems in order to permit different underlying computer architectures to appear to be the same as others in a series. In fact most 360s after the 360/40 (except the 360/165 and 360/168) were microprogrammed implementations. But soon other means of achieving application compatibility were proven to be more significant.The enormous investment in software for these systems made since 1960s caused most of the original computer manufacturers to continue to develop compatible operating systems along with the hardware. The notable supported mainframe operating systems include:The first microcomputers did not have the capacity or need for the elaborate operating systems that had been developed for mainframes and minis; minimalistic operating systems were developed, often loaded from ROM and known as monitors. One notable early disk operating system was CP/M, which was supported on many early microcomputers and was closely imitated by Microsoft's MS-DOS, which became wildly popular as the operating system chosen for the IBM PC (IBM's version of it was called IBM DOS or PC DOS). In the '80s, Apple Computer Inc. (now Apple Inc.) abandoned its popular Apple II series of microcomputers to introduce the Apple Macintosh computer with an innovative Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the Mac OS.The introduction of the Intel 80386 CPU chip with 32-bit architecture and paging capabilities, provided personal computers with the ability to run multitasking operating systems like those of earlier minicomputers and mainframes. Microsoft responded to this progress by hiring Dave Cutler, who had developed the VMS operating system for Digital Equipment Corporation. He would lead the development of the Windows NT operating system, which continues to serve as the basis for Microsoft's operating systems line. Steve Jobs, a co-founder of Apple Inc., started NeXT Computer Inc., which developed the NEXTSTEP operating system. NEXTSTEP would later be acquired by Apple Inc. and used, along with code from FreeBSD as the core of Mac OS X.The GNU Project was started by activist and programmer Richard Stallman with the goal of creating a complete free software replacement to the proprietary UNIX operating system. While the project was highly successful in duplicating the functionality of various parts of UNIX, development of the GNU Hurd kernel proved to be unproductive. In 1991, Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds, with cooperation from volunteers collaborating over the Internet, released the first version of the Linux kernel. It was soon merged with the GNU user space components and system software to form a complete operating system. Since then, the combination of the two major components has usually been referred to as simply "Linux" by the software industry, a naming convention that Stallman and the Free Software Foundation remain opposed to, preferring the name GNU/Linux. The Berkeley Software Distribution, known as BSD, is the UNIX derivative distributed by the University of California, Berkeley, starting in the 1970s. Freely distributed and ported to many minicomputers, it eventually also gained a following for use on PCs, mainly as FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.Unix was originally written in assembly language[5]. Ken Thompson wrote B, mainly based on BCPL, based on his experience in the MULTICS project. B was replaced by C, and Unix, rewriten in C, developed into a large, complex family of inter-related operating systems which have been influential in every modern operating system (see History).The UNIX-like family is a diverse group of operating systems, with several major sub-categories including System V, BSD, and Linux. The name "UNIX" is a trademark of The Open Group which licenses it for use with any operating system that has been shown to conform to their definitions. "UNIX-like" is commonly used to refer to the large set of operating systems which resemble the original UNIX.Unix-like systems run on a wide variety of computer architectures. They are used heavily for servers in business, as well as workstations in academic and engineering environments. Free UNIX variants, such as Linux and BSD, are popular in these areas.Four operating systems are certified by the The Open Group (holder of the Unix trademark) as Unix. HP's HP-UX and IBM's AIX are both descendants of the original System V Unix and are designed to run only on their respective vendor's hardware. In contrast, Sun Microsystems's Solaris Operating System can run on multiple types of hardware, including x86 and Sparc servers, and PCs. Apple's Mac OS X, a replacement for Apple's earlier (non-Unix) Mac OS, is a hybrid kernel-based BSD variant derived from NeXTSTEP, Mach, and FreeBSD.Unix interoperability was sought by establishing the POSIX standard. The POSIX standard can be applied to any operating system, although it was originally created for various Unix variants.A subgroup of the Unix family is the Berkeley Software Distribution family, which includes FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. These operating systems are most commonly found on webservers, although they can also function as a personal computer OS. The Internet owes much of its existence to BSD, as many of the protocols now commonly used by computers to connect, send and receive data over a network were widely implemented and refined in BSD. The world wide web was also first demonstrated on a number of computers running an OS based on BSD called NextStep.BSD has its roots in Unix. In 1974, University of California, Berkeley installed its first Unix system. Over time, students and staff in the computer science department there began adding new programs to make things easier, such as text editors. When Berkely received new VAX computers in 1978 with Unix installed, the school's undergraduates modified Unix even more in order to take advantage of the computer's hardware possibilities. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Department of Defense took interest, and decided to fund the project. Many schools, corporations, and government organizations took notice and started to use Berkeley's version of Unix instead of the official one distributed by AT&T.Steve Jobs, upon leaving Apple Inc. in 1985, formed NeXT Inc., a company that manufactured high-end computers running on a variation of BSD called NeXTSTEP. One of these computers was used by Tim Berners-Lee as the first webserver to create the World Wide Web.Developers like Keith Bostic encouraged the project to replace any non-free code that originated with Bell Labs. Once this was done, however, AT&T sued. Eventually, after two years of legal disputes, the BSD project came out ahead and spawned a number of free derivatives, such as FreeBSD and NetBSD.Mac OS X is a line of open core graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Apple Inc., the latest of which is pre-loaded on all currently shipping Macintosh computers. Mac OS X is the successor to the original Mac OS, which had been Apple's primary operating system since 1984. Unlike its predecessor, Mac OS X is a UNIX operating system built on technology that had been developed at NeXT through the second half of the 1980s and up until Apple purchased the company in early 1997. The operating system was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0, with a desktop-oriented version (Mac OS X v10.0 "Cheetah") following in March 2001. Since then, six more distinct "client" and "server" editions of Mac OS X have been released, the most recent being OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion", which was first made available on February 16, 2012 for developers, and was then released to the public on July 25, 2012. Releases of Mac OS X are named after big cats.The server edition, Mac OS X Server, is architecturally identical to its desktop counterpart but usually runs on Apple's line of Macintosh server hardware. Mac OS X Server includes work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services, including a mail transfer agent, a Samba server, an LDAP server, a domain name server, and others. In Mac OS X v10.7 Lion, all server aspects of Mac OS X Server have been integrated into the client version.[6]Linux (or GNU/Linux) is a Unix-like operating system that was developed without any actual Unix code, unlike BSD and its variants. Linux can be used on a wide range of devices from supercomputers to wristwatches. The Linux kernel is released under an open source license, so anyone can read and modify its code. It has been modified to run on a large variety of electronics. Although estimates suggest that Linux is used on 1.82% of all personal computers,[7][8] it has been widely adopted for use in servers[9] and embedded systems[10] (such as cell phones). Linux has superseded Unix in most places[which?], and is used on the 10 most powerful supercomputers in the world.[11] The Linux kernel is used in some popular distributions, such as Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Google's Android.The GNU project is a mass collaboration of programmers who seek to create a completely free and open operating system that was similar to Unix but with completely original code. It was started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, and is responsible for many of the parts of most Linux variants. Thousands of pieces of software for virtually every operating system are licensed under the GNU General Public License. Meanwhile, the Linux kernel began as a side project of Linus Torvalds, a university student from Finland. In 1991, Torvalds began work on it, and posted information about his project on a newsgroup for computer students and programmers. He received a wave of support and volunteers who ended up creating a full-fledged kernel. Programmers from GNU took notice, and members of both projects worked to integrate the finished GNU parts with the Linux kernel in order to create a full-fledged operating system.Chrome is an operating system based on the Linux kernel and designed by Google. Since Chrome OS targets computer users who spend most of their time on the Internet, it is mainly a web browser with no ability to run applications. It relies on Internet applications (or Web apps) used in the web browser to accomplish tasks such as word processing and media viewing, as well as online storage for storing most files.Microsoft Windows is a family of proprietary operating systems designed by Microsoft Corporation and primarily targeted to Intel architecture based computers, with an estimated 88.9 percent total usage share on Web connected computers.[8][12][13][14] The newest version is Windows 8 for workstations and Windows Server 2012 for servers. Windows 7 recently overtook Windows XP as most used OS.[15][16][17]Microsoft Windows originated in 1985 as an operating environment running on top of MS-DOS, which was the standard operating system shipped on most Intel architecture personal computers at the time. In 1995, Windows 95 was released which only used MS-DOS as a bootstrap. For backwards compatibility, Win9x could run real-mode MS-DOS[18][19] and 16 bits Windows 3.x[20] drivers. Windows Me, released in 2000, was the last version in the Win9x family. Later versions have all been based on the Windows NT kernel. Current versions of Windows run on IA-32 and x86-64 microprocessors, although Windows 8 will support ARM architecture. In the past, Windows NT supported non-Intel architectures.Server editions of Windows are widely used. In recent years, Microsoft has expended significant capital in an effort to promote the use of Windows as a server operating system. However, Windows' usage on servers is not as widespread as on personal computers, as Windows competes against Linux and BSD for server market share.[21][22]There have been many operating systems that were significant in their day but are no longer so, such as AmigaOS; OS/2 from IBM and Microsoft; Mac OS, the non-Unix precursor to Apple's Mac OS X; BeOS; XTS-300; RISC OS; MorphOS and FreeMint. Some are still used in niche markets and continue to be developed as minority platforms for enthusiast communities and specialist applications. OpenVMS formerly from DEC, is still under active development by Hewlett-Packard. Yet other operating systems are used almost exclusively in academia, for operating systems education or to do research on operating system concepts. A typical example of a system that fulfills both roles is MINIX, while for example Singularity is used purely for research.Other operating systems have failed to win significant market share, but have introduced innovations that have influenced mainstream operating systems, not least Bell Labs' Plan 9.The components of an operating system all exist in order to make the different parts of a computer work together. All user software needs to go through the operating system in order to use any of the hardware, whether it be as simple as a mouse or keyboard or as complex as an Internet component.With the aid of the firmware and device drivers, the kernel provides the most basic level of control over all of the computer's hardware devices. It manages memory access for programs in the RAM, it determines which programs get access to which hardware resources, it sets up or resets the CPU's operating states for optimal operation at all times, and it organizes the data for long-term non-volatile storage with file systems on such media as disks, tapes, flash memory, etc.The operating system provides an interface between an application program and the computer hardware, so that an application program can interact with the hardware only by obeying rules and procedures programmed into the operating system. The operating system is also a set of services which simplify development and execution of application programs. Executing an application program involves the creation of a process by the operating system kernel which assigns memory space and other resources, establishes a priority for the process in multi-tasking systems, loads program binary code into memory, and initiates execution of the application program which then interacts with the user and with hardware devices.Interrupts are central to operating systems, as they provide an efficient way for the operating system to interact with and react to its environment. The alternative  having the operating system "watch" the various sources of input for events (polling) that require action  can be found in older systems with very small stacks (50 or 60 bytes) but are unusual in modern systems with large stacks. Interrupt-based programming is directly supported by most modern CPUs. Interrupts provide a computer with a way of automatically saving local register contexts, and running specific code in response to events. Even very basic computers support hardware interrupts, and allow the programmer to specify code which may be run when that event takes place.When an interrupt is received, the computer's hardware automatically suspends whatever program is currently running, saves its status, and runs computer code previously associated with the interrupt; this is analogous to placing a bookmark in a book in response to a phone call. In modern operating systems, interrupts are handled by the operating system's kernel. Interrupts may come from either the computer's hardware or from the running program.When a hardware device triggers an interrupt, the operating system's kernel decides how to deal with this event, generally by running some processing code. The amount of code being run depends on the priority of the interrupt (for example: a person usually responds to a smoke detector alarm before answering the phone). The processing of hardware interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called device driver, which may be either part of the operating system's kernel, part of another program, or both. Device drivers may then relay information to a running program by various means.A program may also trigger an interrupt to the operating system. If a program wishes to access hardware for example, it may interrupt the operating system's kernel, which causes control to be passed back to the kernel. The kernel will then process the request. If a program wishes additional resources (or wishes to shed resources) such as memory, it will trigger an interrupt to get the kernel's attention.Modern CPUs support multiple modes of operation. CPUs with this capability use at least two modes: protected mode and supervisor mode. The supervisor mode is used by the operating system's kernel for low level tasks that need unrestricted access to hardware, such as controlling how memory is written and erased, and communication with devices like graphics cards. Protected mode, in contrast, is used for almost everything else. Applications operate within protected mode, and can only use hardware by communicating with the kernel, which controls everything in supervisor mode. CPUs might have other modes similar to protected mode as well, such as the virtual modes in order to emulate older processor types, such as 16-bit processors on a 32-bit one, or 32-bit processors on a 64-bit one.When a computer first starts up, it is automatically running in supervisor mode. The first few programs to run on the computer, being the BIOS or EFI, bootloader, and the operating system have unlimited access to hardware - and this is required because, by definition, initializing a protected environment can only be done outside of one. However, when the operating system passes control to another program, it can place the CPU into protected mode.In protected mode, programs may have access to a more limited set of the CPU's instructions. A user program may leave protected mode only by triggering an interrupt, causing control to be passed back to the kernel. In this way the operating system can maintain exclusive control over things like access to hardware and memory.The term "protected mode resource" generally refers to one or more CPU registers, which contain information that the running program isn't allowed to alter. Attempts to alter these resources generally causes a switch to supervisor mode, where the operating system can deal with the illegal operation the program was attempting (for example, by killing the program).Among other things, a multiprogramming operating system kernel must be responsible for managing all system memory which is currently in use by programs. This ensures that a program does not interfere with memory already in use by another program. Since programs time share, each program must have independent access to memory.Cooperative memory management, used by many early operating systems, assumes that all programs make voluntary use of the kernel's memory manager, and do not exceed their allocated memory. This system of memory management is almost never seen any more, since programs often contain bugs which can cause them to exceed their allocated memory. If a program fails, it may cause memory used by one or more other programs to be affected or overwritten. Malicious programs or viruses may purposefully alter another program's memory, or may affect the operation of the operating system itself. With cooperative memory management, it takes only one misbehaved program to crash the system.Memory protection enables the kernel to limit a process' access to the computer's memory. Various methods of memory protection exist, including memory segmentation and paging. All methods require some level of hardware support (such as the 80286 MMU), which doesn't exist in all computers.In both segmentation and paging, certain protected mode registers specify to the CPU what memory address it should allow a running program to access. Attempts to access other addresses will trigger an interrupt which will cause the CPU to re-enter supervisor mode, placing the kernel in charge. This is called a segmentation violation or Seg-V for short, and since it is both difficult to assign a meaningful result to such an operation, and because it is usually a sign of a misbehaving program, the kernel will generally resort to terminating the offending program, and will report the error.Windows 3.1-Me had some level of memory protection, but programs could easily circumvent the need to use it. A general protection fault would be produced, indicating a segmentation violation had occurred; however, the system would often crash anyway.The use of virtual memory addressing (such as paging or segmentation) means that the kernel can choose what memory each program may use at any given time, allowing the operating system to use the same memory locations for multiple tasks.If a program tries to access memory that isn't in its current range of accessible memory, but nonetheless has been allocated to it, the kernel will be interrupted in the same way as it would if the program were to exceed its allocated memory. (See section on memory management.) Under UNIX this kind of interrupt is referred to as a page fault.When the kernel detects a page fault it will generally adjust the virtual memory range of the program which triggered it, granting it access to the memory requested. This gives the kernel discretionary power over where a particular application's memory is stored, or even whether or not it has actually been allocated yet.In modern operating systems, memory which is accessed less frequently can be temporarily stored on disk or other media to make that space available for use by other programs. This is called swapping, as an area of memory can be used by multiple programs, and what that memory area contains can be swapped or exchanged on demand."Virtual memory" provides the programmer or the user with the perception that there is a much larger amount of RAM in the computer than is really there.[23]Multitasking refers to the running of multiple independent computer programs on the same computer; giving the appearance that it is performing the tasks at the same time. Since most computers can do at most one or two things at one time, this is generally done via time-sharing, which means that each program uses a share of the computer's time to execute.An operating system kernel contains a piece of software called a scheduler which determines how much time each program will spend executing, and in which order execution control should be passed to programs. Control is passed to a process by the kernel, which allows the program access to the CPU and memory. Later, control is returned to the kernel through some mechanism, so that another program may be allowed to use the CPU. This so-called passing of control between the kernel and applications is called a context switch.An early model which governed the allocation of time to programs was called cooperative multitasking. In this model, when control is passed to a program by the kernel, it may execute for as long as it wants before explicitly returning control to the kernel. This means that a malicious or malfunctioning program may not only prevent any other programs from using the CPU, but it can hang the entire system if it enters an infinite loop.Modern operating systems extend the concepts of application preemption to device drivers and kernel code, so that the operating system has preemptive control over internal run-times as well.The philosophy governing preemptive multitasking is that of ensuring that all programs are given regular time on the CPU. This implies that all programs must be limited in how much time they are allowed to spend on the CPU without being interrupted. To accomplish this, modern operating system kernels make use of a timed interrupt. A protected mode timer is set by the kernel which triggers a return to supervisor mode after the specified time has elapsed. (See above sections on Interrupts and Dual Mode Operation.)On many single user operating systems cooperative multitasking is perfectly adequate, as home computers generally run a small number of well tested programs. The AmigaOS is an exception, having pre-emptive multitasking from its very first version. Windows NT was the first version of Microsoft Windows which enforced preemptive multitasking, but it didn't reach the home user market until Windows XP (since Windows NT was targeted at professionals).Access to data stored on disks is a central feature of all operating systems. Computers store data on disks using files, which are structured in specific ways in order to allow for faster access, higher reliability, and to make better use out of the drive's available space. The specific way in which files are stored on a disk is called a file system, and enables files to have names and attributes. It also allows them to be stored in a hierarchy of directories or folders arranged in a directory tree.Early operating systems generally supported a single type of disk drive and only one kind of file system. Early file systems were limited in their capacity, speed, and in the kinds of file names and directory structures they could use. These limitations often reflected limitations in the operating systems they were designed for, making it very difficult for an operating system to support more than one file system.While many simpler operating systems support a limited range of options for accessing storage systems, operating systems like UNIX and Linux support a technology known as a virtual file system or VFS. An operating system such as UNIX supports a wide array of storage devices, regardless of their design or file systems, allowing them to be accessed through a common application programming interface (API). This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessing. A VFS allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them, through the use of specific device drivers and file system drivers.A connected storage device, such as a hard drive, is accessed through a device driver. The device driver understands the specific language of the drive and is able to translate that language into a standard language used by the operating system to access all disk drives. On UNIX, this is the language of block devices.When the kernel has an appropriate device driver in place, it can then access the contents of the disk drive in raw format, which may contain one or more file systems. A file system driver is used to translate the commands used to access each specific file system into a standard set of commands that the operating system can use to talk to all file systems. Programs can then deal with these file systems on the basis of filenames, and directories/folders, contained within a hierarchical structure. They can create, delete, open, and close files, as well as gather various information about them, including access permissions, size, free space, and creation and modification dates.Various differences between file systems make supporting all file systems difficult. Allowed characters in file names, case sensitivity, and the presence of various kinds of file attributes makes the implementation of a single interface for every file system a daunting task. Operating systems tend to recommend using (and so support natively) file systems specifically designed for them; for example, NTFS in Windows and ext3 and ReiserFS in Linux. However, in practice, third party drives are usually available to give support for the most widely used file systems in most general-purpose operating systems (for example, NTFS is available in Linux through NTFS-3g, and ext2/3 and ReiserFS are available in Windows through third-party software).Support for file systems is highly varied among modern operating systems, although there are several common file systems which almost all operating systems include support and drivers for. Operating systems vary on file system support and on the disk formats they may be installed on. Under Windows, each file system is usually limited in application to certain media; for example, CDs must use ISO 9660 or UDF, and as of Windows Vista, NTFS is the only file system which the operating system can be installed on. It is possible to install Linux onto many types of file systems. Unlike other operating systems, Linux and UNIX allow any file system to be used regardless of the media it is stored in, whether it is a hard drive, a disc (CD,DVD...), a USB flash drive, or even contained within a file located on another file system.A device driver is a specific type of computer software developed to allow interaction with hardware devices. Typically this constitutes an interface for communicating with the device, through the specific computer bus or communications subsystem that the hardware is connected to, providing commands to and/or receiving data from the device, and on the other end, the requisite interfaces to the operating system and software applications. It is a specialized hardware-dependent computer program which is also operating system specific that enables another program, typically an operating system or applications software package or computer program running under the operating system kernel, to interact transparently with a hardware device, and usually provides the requisite interrupt handling necessary for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interfacing needs.The key design goal of device drivers is abstraction. Every model of hardware (even within the same class of device) is different. Newer models also are released by manufacturers that provide more reliable or better performance and these newer models are often controlled differently. Computers and their operating systems cannot be expected to know how to control every device, both now and in the future. To solve this problem, operating systems essentially dictate how every type of device should be controlled. The function of the device driver is then to translate these operating system mandated function calls into device specific calls. In theory a new device, which is controlled in a new manner, should function correctly if a suitable driver is available. This new driver will ensure that the device appears to operate as usual from the operating system's point of view.Under versions of Windows before Vista and versions of Linux before 2.6, all driver execution was co-operative, meaning that if a driver entered an infinite loop it would freeze the system. More recent revisions of these operating systems incorporate kernel preemption, where the kernel interrupts the driver to give it tasks, and then separates itself from the process until it receives a response from the device driver, or gives it more tasks to do.Currently most operating systems support a variety of networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means that computers running dissimilar operating systems can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless connections. Networks can essentially allow a computer's operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer. This includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer's graphics or sound hardware. Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently, such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computer's command line interface.Client/server networking allows a program on a computer, called a client, to connect via a network to another computer, called a server. Servers offer (or host) various services to other network computers and users. These services are usually provided through ports or numbered access points beyond the server's network address. Each port number is usually associated with a maximum of one running program, which is responsible for handling requests to that port. A daemon, being a user program, can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the operating system kernel.Many operating systems support one or more vendor-specific or open networking protocols as well, for example, SNA on IBM systems, DECnet on systems from Digital Equipment Corporation, and Microsoft-specific protocols (SMB) on Windows. Specific protocols for specific tasks may also be supported such as NFS for file access. Protocols like ESound, or esd can be easily extended over the network to provide sound from local applications, on a remote system's sound hardware.A computer being secure depends on a number of technologies working properly. A modern operating system provides access to a number of resources, which are available to software running on the system, and to external devices like networks via the kernel.The operating system must be capable of distinguishing between requests which should be allowed to be processed, and others which should not be processed. While some systems may simply distinguish between "privileged" and "non-privileged", systems commonly have a form of requester identity, such as a user name. To establish identity there may be a process of authentication. Often a username must be quoted, and each username may have a password. Other methods of authentication, such as magnetic cards or biometric data, might be used instead. In some cases, especially connections from the network, resources may be accessed with no authentication at all (such as reading files over a network share). Also covered by the concept of requester identity is authorization; the particular services and resources accessible by the requester once logged into a system are tied to either the requester's user account or to the variously configured groups of users to which the requester belongs.In addition to the allow/disallow model of security, a system with a high level of security will also offer auditing options. These would allow tracking of requests for access to resources (such as, "who has been reading this file?"). Internal security, or security from an already running program is only possible if all possibly harmful requests must be carried out through interrupts to the operating system kernel. If programs can directly access hardware and resources, they cannot be secured.External security involves a request from outside the computer, such as a login at a connected console or some kind of network connection. External requests are often passed through device drivers to the operating system's kernel, where they can be passed onto applications, or carried out directly. Security of operating systems has long been a concern because of highly sensitive data held on computers, both of a commercial and military nature. The United States Government Department of Defense (DoD) created the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) which is a standard that sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of security. This became of vital importance to operating system makers, because the TCSEC was used to evaluate, classify and select trusted operating systems being considered for the processing, storage and retrieval of sensitive or classified information.Network services include offerings such as file sharing, print services, email, web sites, and file transfer protocols (FTP), most of which can have compromised security. At the front line of security are hardware devices known as firewalls or intrusion detection/prevention systems. At the operating system level, there are a number of software firewalls available, as well as intrusion detection/prevention systems. Most modern operating systems include a software firewall, which is enabled by default. A software firewall can be configured to allow or deny network traffic to or from a service or application running on the operating system. Therefore, one can install and be running an insecure service, such as Telnet or FTP, and not have to be threatened by a security breach because the firewall would deny all traffic trying to connect to the service on that port.An alternative strategy, and the only sandbox strategy available in systems that do not meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements, is the operating system not running user programs as native code, but instead either emulates a processor or provides a host for a p-code based system such as Java.Internal security is especially relevant for multi-user systems; it allows each user of the system to have private files that the other users cannot tamper with or read. Internal security is also vital if auditing is to be of any use, since a program can potentially bypass the operating system, inclusive of bypassing auditing.Every computer that is to be operated by an individual requires a user interface. The user interface is usually referred to as a shell and is essential if human interaction is to be supported. The user interface views the directory structure and requests services from the operating system that will acquire data from input hardware devices, such as a keyboard, mouse or credit card reader, and requests operating system services to display prompts, status messages and such on output hardware devices, such as a video monitor or printer. The two most common forms of a user interface have historically been the command-line interface, where computer commands are typed out line-by-line, and the graphical user interface, where a visual environment (most commonly a WIMP) is present.Most of the modern computer systems support graphical user interfaces (GUI), and often include them. In some computer systems, such as the original implementation of Mac OS, the GUI is integrated into the kernel.While technically a graphical user interface is not an operating system service, incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by reducing the number of context switches required for the GUI to perform its output functions. Other operating systems are modular, separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the Operating System. In the 1980s UNIX, VMS and many others had operating systems that were built this way. Linux and Mac OS X are also built this way. Modern releases of Microsoft Windows such as Windows Vista implement a graphics subsystem that is mostly in user-space; however the graphics drawing routines of versions between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003 exist mostly in kernel space. Windows 9x had very little distinction between the interface and the kernel.Many computer operating systems allow the user to install or create any user interface they desire. The XWindow System in conjunction with GNOME or KDE Plasma Desktop is a commonly found setup on most Unix and Unix-like (BSD, Linux, Solaris) systems. A number of Windows shell replacements have been released for Microsoft Windows, which offer alternatives to the included Windows shell, but the shell itself cannot be separated from Windows.Numerous Unix-based GUIs have existed over time, most derived from X11. Competition among the various vendors of Unix (HP, IBM, Sun) led to much fragmentation, though an effort to standardize in the 1990s to COSE and CDE failed for various reasons, and were eventually eclipsed by the widespread adoption of GNOME and K Desktop Environment. Prior to free software-based toolkits and desktop environments, Motif was the prevalent toolkit/desktop combination (and was the basis upon which CDE was developed).Graphical user interfaces evolve over time. For example, Windows has modified its user interface almost every time a new major version of Windows is released, and the MacOS GUI changed dramatically with the introduction of MacOSX in 1999.[24]A real-time operating system (RTOS) is a multitasking operating system intended for applications with fixed deadlines (real-time computing). Such applications include some small embedded systems, automobile engine controllers, industrial robots, spacecraft, industrial control, and some large-scale computing systems.An early example of a large-scale real-time operating system was Transaction Processing Facility developed by American Airlines and IBM for the Sabre Airline Reservations System.Embedded systems that have fixed deadlines use a real-time operating system such as VxWorks, PikeOS, eCos, QNX, MontaVista Linux and RTLinux. Windows CE is a real-time operating system that shares similar APIs to desktop Windows but shares none of desktop Windows' codebase.[citation needed] Symbian OS also has an RTOS kernel (EKA2) starting with version 8.0b.Some embedded systems use operating systems such as Palm OS, BSD, and Linux, although such operating systems do not support real-time computing.Operating system development is one of the most complicated activities in which a computing hobbyist may engage. A hobby operating system may be classified as one whose code has not been directly derived from an existing operating system, and has few users and active developers. [25]In some cases, hobby development is in support of a "homebrew" computing device, for example, a simple single-board computer powered by a 6502 microprocessor. Or, development may be for an architecture already in widespread use. Operating system development may come from entirely new concepts, or may commence by modeling an existing operating system. In either case, the hobbyist is his/her own developer, or may interact with a small and sometimes unstructured group of individuals who have like interests.Examples of a hobby operating system include ReactOS and Syllable.Application software is generally written for use on a specific operating system, and sometimes even for specific hardware. When porting the application to run on another OS, the functionality required by that application may be implemented differently by that OS (the names of functions, meaning of arguments, etc.) requiring the application to be adapted, changed, or otherwise maintained.This cost in supporting operating systems diversity can be avoided by instead writing applications against software platforms like Java or Qt. These abstractions have already borne the cost of adaptation to specific operating systems and their system libraries.Another approach is for operating system vendors to adopt standards. For example, POSIX and OS abstraction layers provide commonalities that reduce porting costs.Process managementInterruptsMemory managementFile systemDevice driversNetworking (TCP/IP, UDP)Security (Process/Memory protection)I/Ovte1 Types of operating systems2 History

Henry M. Gunn High School is one of two public high schools in Palo Alto, California. Gunn High School is a four-year high school with a current enrollment of just over 1,900 students.[1]The academic year has two semesters with 240 minutes of weekly instruction for every class. The school's schedule operates on a rotating bell schedule with classes assigned to lettered "periods" from A through G.In the spring of 2010, Gunn High School was picketed by the Westboro Baptist Church. Rather than responding with violence, students and staff staged a successful counter-demonstration in the form of a Phelps-A-Thon. As a result, the school received favorable press and publicity and raised more than $1,100.00 for its gay-straight alliance.[2][3]Gunn is well known for its academically rigorous environment and enjoys a spirited academic and athletic rivalry with nearby Palo Alto High School.Established in 1964, Gunn High School was named after the late Henry M. Gunn (18981988), who served as the Palo Alto superintendent from 1950 to 1961. In 1964, the Palo Alto Unified School District announced it would name the district's third high school after him. The Class of 1966 was the first class to graduate from Gunn High School.[4]U.S. News & World Report rated Gunn High School 66th in 2007, 74th in 2008, and 64th in 2010.[5] Newsweek rated Gunn High School the 81st best high school in America in 2008 and 42nd in 2011.[6]95.9% of the graduating class go on to attend college, with 80.2% going to four-year colleges. The average SAT score for Gunn seniors is 1942 for the Class of 2010 (633 CR, 673 M, 636 W).[7] Gunn has one of the highest average SAT scores for public high schools in the United States. Gunn also has many students who are selected as National Merit Semifinalists  43 in 2007, 44 in 2008, 31 in 2009, 42 in 2010, 30 in 2011, and 36 in 2012.[8] In addition, 50 students received a National Merit letter of commendation in 2007, 50 in 2008, 60 in 2009, 68 in 2010 and 74 in 2011. Usually 25% of the Gunn senior class receives one of these two National Merit honors.Gunn offers 22 AP classes and 8 Honors classes that count for the weighted GPA.[7] In May 2010, 657 students took 1820 AP tests. 93% scored 3 or higher and 54% scored a grade of 5. Gunn does not rank students individually  ranking is reported by decile.[7]Education in mathematics and sciences is particularly strong. In 2004, 5 students qualified for the USAMO out of around 250 nationally, and during the 20042005 school year 5 out of the approximately 35 American students in the Gold Division of the USACO were from Gunn. In 2009, nine students qualified for the USAMO. Gunn also consistently places in the Top 3 at the Bay Area Mathematics Olympiad (BAMO). In 2011, the Gunn team placed 9th at the Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament.In 2011, Gunn had four national semifinalists in the Siemens Competition and the Intel Science Talent Search, two of the most prestigious science competitions in America. In each competition, one individual went on to compete at the finalist stage.[9][10]Gunn is also host to PLTW, an organization that promotes science, technology, engineering, and math. Courses from this program include Digital Electronics and Introduction to Engineering Design, as well as Principles of Engineering.[11] However, in the 2012-2013 school year, only Introduction to Engineering Design will be offered. Digital Electronics was cancelled due to low enrollment and Principles of Engineering was cancelled due to funding issues.The ethnic and racial makeup of the 20102011 student population are: Caucasian  49.5%, Asian  34.9%, Hispanic  7.4%, Asian Indian  5.5%, African American  2.1%, Multiple or no response  20.2%. Males make up 51.0% and females make up 49.0%.[12] Approximately 6% of the student body are economically disadvantaged and 4% are English Learners.Gunn offers over 80 student clubs, teams, and organizations that focus on art, community action, culture, environment, politics, music, dance, journalism, and more.The Oracle is Gunn's official student newspaper publication. The organization was established in 1964. The newspaper publishes nine issues of approximately 28 pages every school year and concludes the year with the publication of a Senior Issue.[13]The Gunn Associated Student Body Student Executive Council (SEC) is in charge of maintaining student funds and planning and executing activities that foster school spirit and make high school memorable.[14] SEC handles Homecoming Week, Spring Fling, school dances, special events, and rallies on campus. SEC is led by an elected President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Class Presidents and VP's, and various Commissioners.[15]Gunn students stage three major productions every year (Fall, Spring and One Acts) and occasional staged readings.[16] Current theatre director James Shelby has been with the program since 1983.The Gunn Music Program has a long and proud tradition of excellence, achieving outstanding group results while rewarding individual competence and dedication.[17] The program contains several music groups including a Symphonic Band, Wind Ensemble, Jazz Ensemble, Orchestra, Concert Band, Concert Choir, and Chamber Singers.The acclaimed[18][19] Gunn Robotics Team (GRT), established in 1997, has consistently placed in the top 25 at the FIRST Robotics Competition. It is also the only FIRST Robotics team to have won the national animation award more than once, winning in 1997, 2006, and 2012. They also won best models worldwide in their 2010 animation.[20] In 2012 The Robotics Team won the Chesapeake Bay Regional in Baltimore and won National FRC Championship Excellence in Design Award (3D Animation) sponsored by Autodesk. GRT is the only team that has won a total of three Animation awards in the history of FIRST.[21]Coordinates: 372356N 1220759W / 37.399N 122.133W / 37.399; -122.1331 History2 Academic reputation

24.0.1312.25 (November27,2012; 4 days ago(2012-11-27))[5]Google Chrome is a freeware web browser [6] developed by Google that uses the WebKit layout engine. It was released as a beta version for Microsoft Windows on September 2, 2008, and as a stable public release on December 11, 2008. As of September 2012[update], according to StatCounter, Google Chrome had 34% worldwide usage share of web browsers making it the most widely used web browser.[7] W3Counter indicated that Chrome became the leading browser globally in August 2012 with 28% marketshare.[8] However, Net Applications indicates that Chrome is only third when it comes to the size of its user base, behind Internet Explorer and Firefox.[9]In September 2008, Google released a large portion of Chrome's source code as an open source project called Chromium,[10][11] which Chrome releases are still based on.Google's Chief Executive Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent web browser for six years. He stated that "at the time, Google was a small company", and he did not want to go through "bruising browser wars". After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, however, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind".[12]The release announcement was originally scheduled for September 3, 2008, and a comic by Scott McCloud was to be sent to journalists and bloggers explaining the features within the new browser.[13] Copies intended for Europe were shipped early and German blogger Philipp Lenssen of Google Blogoscoped[14] made a scanned copy of the 38-page comic available on his website after receiving it on September 1, 2008.[15] Google subsequently made the comic available on Google Books[16] and mentioned it on their official blog along with an explanation for the early release.[17]The browser was first publicly released for Microsoft Windows (XP and later versions) on September 2, 2008 in 43 languages, officially a beta version.[18]On the same day, a CNET news item[19] drew attention to a passage in the Terms of Service statement for the initial beta release, which seemed to grant to Google a license to all content transferred via the Chrome browser. This passage was inherited from the general Google terms of service.[20] Google responded to this criticism immediately by stating that the language used was borrowed from other products, and removed this passage from the Terms of Service.[21]Chrome quickly gained about 1% usage share.[17][22][23][24] After the initial surge, usage share dropped until it hit a low of 0.69% in October 2008. It then started rising again and by December 2008, Chrome again passed the 1% threshold.[25]In early January 2009, CNET reported that Google planned to release versions of Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux in the first half of the year.[26] The first official Chrome OS X and Linux developer previews[27] were announced on June 4, 2009 with a blog post[28] saying they were missing many features and were intended for early feedback rather than general use.In December 2009, Google released beta versions of Chrome for Mac OS X and Linux.[29][30] Google Chrome 5.0, announced on May 25, 2010, was the first stable release to support all three platforms.[31]Chrome was one of the twelve browsers offered to European Economic Area users of Microsoft Windows in 2010.[32]Chrome was assembled from 25 different code libraries from Google and third parties such as Mozilla's Netscape Portable Runtime, Network Security Services, NPAPI, as well as SQLite and a number of other open-source projects.[33] The V8 JavaScript virtual machine was considered a sufficiently important project to be split off (as was Adobe/Mozilla's Tamarin) and handled by a separate team in Denmark coordinated by Lars Bak at Aarhus. According to Google, existing implementations were designed "for small programs, where the performance and interactivity of the system weren't that important", but web applications such as Gmail "are using the web browser to the fullest when it comes to DOM manipulations and JavaScript", and therefore would significantly benefit from a JavaScript engine that could work faster.Chrome uses the WebKit rendering engine to display web pages, on advice from the Android team.[16] Chrome is tested internally with unit testing, "automated user interface testing of scripted user actions", fuzz testing, as well as WebKit's layout tests (99% of which Chrome is claimed to have passed) and against commonly accessed websites inside the Google index within 2030 minutes.[16]Google created Gears for Chrome, which added features for web developers typically relating to the building of web applications, including offline support.[16] However, Google phased out Gears in favor of HTML5.[35]On January 11, 2011 the Chrome product manager, Mike Jazayeri, announced that Chrome will no longer support H.264 video codec for its HTML5 player, citing the desire to bring Google Chrome more in line with the currently available open codecs available in the Chromium project, which Chrome is based on.[36] As of January 2012, there has been no announcement yet of which future version of Chrome will actually implement the removal of H.264 support.On February 7, 2012, Google launched Google Chrome Beta for Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) devices.[37] In Jelly Bean devices, Chrome is the default browser.[38]In March 2012 Google announced it was working on a version of Chrome for both the Metro and desktop versions of Windows 8.[39]In December 2010 Google announced that to make deploying Chrome easier in a business environment they would provide an official Chrome MSI package. For enterprise deployments it's important to have full-fledged MSI packages that can be customized via transform files (.mst), but the provided MSI is only a very limiting MSI wrapper around the normal installer that does not fulfill enterprise needs.[40] The normal downloaded Chrome installer puts the browser in the user's local app data directory and provides invisible background updates, but the MSI package will allow installation at the system level, providing system administrators control over the update process[41]  it was formerly possible only when Chrome was installed using Google Pack. Google also created Group Policies to fine tune the behavior of Chrome in the business environment, for example setting automatic updates interval, disable auto-updates, a home page and to workaround their basic Windows design flaws and bugs if it comes to roaming profiles support, etc.[42] Until version 22 the software is known not to be ready for enterprise deployments with roaming profiles or Terminal Server/Citrix environments.[43]In September 2008, Google released a large portion of Chrome's source code as an open source project called Chromium. This move enabled third-party developers to study the underlying source code and to help port the browser to the Mac OS X and Linux operating systems. The Google-authored portion of Chromium is released under the permissive BSD license.[44] Other portions of the source code are subject to a variety of open source licenses.[45] Chromium is similar to Chrome, but lacks built-in automatic updates, built-in PDF reader and built-in Flash player, as well as Google branding and has a blue-colored logo instead of the multicolored Google logo.[46][47] Chromium does not implement user RLZ tracking.[48][49][50]Click "show" to expand the release history table below.Legend:Notes:Google Chrome aims to be secure, fast, simple[100] and stable. There are extensive differences from its peers in Chrome's minimalistic user interface,[16] which is atypical of modern web browsers.[101] For example, Chrome does not render RSS feeds.[102] One of Chrome's strengths is its application performance and JavaScript processing speed, both of which were independently verified by multiple websites to be the swiftest among the major browsers of its time.[103][104] Many of Chrome's unique features had been previously announced by other browser developers, but Google was the first to implement and publicly release them.[105] For example, its most prominent graphical user interface (GUI) innovation, the merging of the address bar and search bar (the Omnibox), was first announced by Mozilla in May 2008 as a planned feature for Firefox.[106] Both Internet Explorer 9 and Safari (version 6) have since merged the search and address bar.The first release of Google Chrome passed both the Acid1 and Acid2 tests. Beginning with version 4.0, Chrome has passed all aspects of the Acid3 test.[55]Chrome has currently quite good support for JavaScript/ECMAScript according to Ecma International's ECMAScript standards conformance Test 262[107] (version ES5.1 of 2012-05-18). This test reports as final score the number of tests a browser failed; hence lower scores are better. In this test, Chrome version 23.0.1271 scored 9/11570, the beta version 22.0.1215.1 scored 16/11570, and the dev version 25.0.1323.0 scored 14/11570. For comparison, Firefox 15 scored 172/11750 and Internet Explorer 9 has a score of 600+, while Internet Explorer 10 has a score of 7.On the official CSS 2.1 test suite by standardization organization W3C, WebKit, the Chrome rendering engine, passes 89.75% (89.38% out of 99.59% covered) CSS 2.1 tests.[108]On the HTML5 test (version 3.0), Chrome 22 on desktop scored 437 out of 500, with 13 bonus points. It was also the top scorer among all web browsers. Chrome's tablet version was second place, with 371 points. Chrome got first place on mobile browsers, with 371 points.[109][110][111]Chrome periodically retrieves updates of two blacklists (one for phishing and one for malware), and warns users when they attempt to visit a harmful site. This service is also made available for use by others via a free public API called "Google Safe Browsing API".[16]Chrome will typically allocate each tab to fit into its own process to "prevent malware from installing itself" and prevent what happens in one tab from affecting what happens in another; however, the actual process-allocation model is more complex.[112] Following the principle of least privilege, each process is stripped of its rights and can compute, but cannot write files or read from sensitive areas (e.g. documents, desktop)  this is similar to the "Protected Mode" used by Internet Explorer on Windows Vista and Windows 7. The Sandbox Team is said to have "taken this existing process boundary and made it into a jail";[113] for example, malicious software running in one tab is supposed to be unable to sniff credit card numbers entered in another tab, interact with mouse inputs, or tell Windows to "run an executable on start-up" and it will be terminated when the tab is closed.[16] This enforces a simple computer security model whereby there are two levels of multilevel security (user and sandbox) and the sandbox can only respond to communication requests initiated by the user.[114] On Linux sandboxing uses the seccomp mode.[115][116]In December 2011 a report by Accuvant, funded by Google, rated the security (based on sandboxing) of Google Chrome as better than either Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox.[117]No security vulnerabilities in Chrome had been successfully exploited in the three years of Pwn2Own from 200911.[118] However, Chrome was the first browser to be defeated at Pwn2Own 2012, by a French team who used zero day exploits to take complete control of a fully patched 64-bit Windows 7 PC using a booby-trapped website that overcame Chrome's sandboxing. It was also compromised twice at the 2012 CanSecWest Pwnium.[119][120][121]Google's official response to the vulnerabilities was delivered by Jason Kersey, who congratulated the researchers, noting "We also believe that both submissions are works of art and deserve wider sharing and recognition."[122] The browser Version 23 addressed 15 security vulnerabilities in which six are rated as high sensitivity and fixed[123]A study has shown that users are four times more likely to be tricked into downloading malware than be compromised by an exploit.[124] A May 2011 study reported Chrome 10 blocked only 13% of malicious URLs, the same as Safari and Firefox, behind Internet Explorer 9 which blocked 92%, and 100% with application-based filtering enabled. Referring to that study, Ars Technica wrote in July 2011 that "Even with the false positives, Microsoft's approach appears to be more secure."[125][126] A February 2012 study reported that Chrome 15 had a 34.1% malware-blocking rate.[127][128] Neither study analyzed exploits that install malware without the user being aware (for example clickjacking and drive-by downloads).Google introduced new security functionality  download scanning protection  in Chrome 17.[81][129]The private browsing feature called Incognito mode prevents the browser from permanently storing any history information or cookies from the websites visited.[137] Incognito mode is similar to the private browsing feature in other web browsers. Chrome was the second browser to implement this feature, after Safari.Chrome sends details about its usage to Google through both optional and non-optional user tracking mechanisms.[138]On installationSome of the tracking mechanisms can be optionally enabled and disabled through the installation interface[144] and through the browser's options dialog.[142] Unofficial builds, such as SRWare Iron and CoolNovo (previously known as ChromePlus), seek to remove these features from the browser altogether.[139] The RLZ feature is not included in the Chromium browser either.[50]In March 2010, Google devised a new method to collect installation statistics: the unique ID token included with Chrome is now only used for the first connection that Google Update makes to its server.[145]The optional suggestion service included in Google Chrome has been criticized because it provides the information typed into the Omnibox to the search provider before the user even hits return. This allows the search engine to provide URL suggestions, but also provides them with web usage information tied to an IP address.[146]In February 2012, Google announced that Chrome would support Do Not Track by the end of 2012 and the protocol was implemented on version 23.[147]The JavaScript virtual machine used by Chrome, the V8 JavaScript engine, has features such as dynamic code generation, hidden class transitions, and precise garbage collection.[16]Several websites performed benchmark tests using the SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark tool as well as Google's own set of computationally intense benchmarks, which include ray tracing and constraint solving.[148] They unanimously reported that Chrome performed much faster than all competitors against which it had been tested, including Safari (for Windows), Firefox 3.0, Internet Explorer 7, Opera, and Internet Explorer 8.[149][150][151][152][153][154] However in more recent independent tests of JavaScript performance, Chrome has been scoring just behind Opera's Presto engine since it was updated in version 10.5.[155]On September 3, 2008, Mozilla responded by stating that their own TraceMonkey JavaScript engine (then in beta), was faster than Chrome's V8 engine in some tests.[156][157][158] John Resig, Mozilla's JavaScript evangelist, further commented on the performance of different browsers on Google's own suite, commenting on Chrome's "decimating" (sic) of the other browsers, but he questioned whether Google's suite was representative of real programs. He stated that Firefox 3.0 performed poorly on recursion-intensive benchmarks, such as those of Google, because the Mozilla team had not implemented recursion-tracing yet.[159]Two weeks after Chrome's launch, the WebKit team announced a new JavaScript engine, SquirrelFish Extreme,[160] citing a 36% speed improvement over Chrome's V8 engine.[161][162][163]Chrome uses DNS prefetching to speed up website lookups,[164] as other browsers like Firefox,[165] Safari,[166] Internet Explorer (called DNS Pre-resolution),[167] and in Opera as a UserScript (not built-in).[168]Chrome utilizes the faster SPDY protocol instead of HTTP[169][170] when communicating with Google services, such as Google Search, Gmail, Chrome sync and when serving Google's ads. Google acknowledges that the use of SPDY is enabled in the communication between Chrome and Google's SSL-enabled servers.[171]A multi-process architecture is implemented in Chrome[172] where, by default, a separate process is allocated to each site instance and plugin. This procedure is termed process isolation,[173] and it prevents tasks from interfering with each other, raising security and stability. An attacker successfully gaining access to one application gains access to no others,[174] and failure in one instance results in a Sad Tab screen of death, similar to the well-known Sad Mac, but only one tab crashes instead of the whole application. This strategy exacts a fixed per-process cost up front, but results in less memory bloat overall as fragmentation is confined to each instance and no longer needs further memory allocations.[16] This architecture is being adopted in upcoming versions of Safari[175] and Firefox.[176]Chrome includes a process management utility called Task Manager which lets users see what sites and plugins are using the most memory, downloading the most bytes and overusing the CPU and provides the ability to terminate them.[16] Chrome Version 23 ensures its users a improved battery life for the systems supporting Chrome's GPU accelerated video decoding.[177]By default, the main user interface includes back, forward, refresh/cancel and menu buttons. A home button is not shown by default, but can be added through the Settings page to take the user to the new tab page or a custom home page.[178]Tabs are the main component of Chrome's user interface and as such, have been moved to the top of the window rather than below the controls. This subtle change contrasts with many existing tabbed browsers which are based on windows and contain tabs. Tabs, with their state, can be transferred seamlessly between window containers by dragging. Each tab has its own set of controls, including the Omnibox.[16]The Omnibox is a URL box that combines the functions of both the address bar and search box. If a user enters the URL of a site previously searched from, Chrome allows pressing Tab to search the site again directly from the Omnibox. When a user starts typing in the Omnibox, Chrome provides suggestions for previously visited sites (based on the URL or in-page text), popular websites (not necessarily visited before  powered by Google Instant), and popular searches. Although Instant can be turned off, suggestions based on previously visited sites cannot be turned off. Chrome will also autocomplete the URLs of sites visited often.[16] If a user types keywords into the Omnibox that don't match any previously visited websites and presses enter, Chrome will conduct the search using the default search engine.One of Chrome's differentiating features is the New Tab Page, which can replace the browser home page and is displayed when a new tab is created. Originally, this showed thumbnails of the nine most visited web sites, along with frequent searches, recent bookmarks, and recently closed tabs; similar to Internet Explorer and Firefox with Google Toolbar, or Opera's Speed Dial.[16] In Google Chrome 2.0, the New Tab Page was updated to allow users to hide thumbnails they did not want to appear.[179]Starting in version 3.0, the New Tab Page was revamped to display thumbnails of the eight most visited web sites. The thumbnails could be rearranged, pinned, and removed. Alternatively, a list of text links could be displayed instead of thumbnails. It also features a "Recently closed" bar that shows recently closed tabs and a "tips" section that displays hints and tricks for using the browser.[180]Chrome includes a bookmark manager that can be opened from a menu. Adding the command-line option --bookmark-menu adds a bookmarks button to the right of the Omnibox that can be used in place of the bookmarks bar.[181] As of 2009[update], this function was unavailable on the Linux and Mac platforms.[182]Popup windows are associated with the tab they came from and will not appear outside the tab unless the user explicitly drags them out.[16]For web developers, Chrome features an element inspector similar to the one in Firebug.[164]Chrome has special URLs that load application-specific pages instead of websites or files on disk. Chrome also has a built-in ability to enable experimental features. Originally called about:labs, the address was changed to about:flags to make it less obvious to casual users.[183][184]In March 2011, Google introduced a new simplified logo to replace the previous 3D logo that had been used since the project's inception. Google designer Steve Rura explained the company reasoning for the change: "Since Chrome is all about making your web experience as easy and clutter-free as possible, we refreshed the Chrome icon to better represent these sentiments. A simpler icon embodies the Chrome spirit  to make the web quicker, lighter, and easier for all."[69]Chrome allows users to make local desktop shortcuts that open web applications in the browser. The browser, when opened in this way, contains none of the regular interface except for the title bar, so as not to "interrupt anything the user is trying to do". This allows web applications to run alongside local software (similar to Mozilla Prism and Fluid).[16]This feature, according to Google, will be enhanced with the Chrome Web Store, a one-stop web-based web applications directory which opened in December 2010.[185][186]Announced on December 7, 2010, the Chrome Web Store allows users to install web applications as extensions to the browser, although most of these function simply as links to popular web pages and/or games, but some of the apps like Springpad do provide extra features like offline access. The themes and extensions have also been tightly integrated into the new store, allowing users to search the entire catalog of Chrome extras.[187]The Chrome Web Store was opened on February 11, 2011 with the release of Google Chrome 9.0.[188]On September 9, 2009, Google enabled extensions by default on Chrome's Dev channel, and provided several sample extensions for testing.[189] In December, the Google Chrome extension gallery beta began with over 300 extensions.[30][190]Along with Google Chrome 4.0, the extension gallery was officially launched on January 25, 2010, containing over 1500 extensions.[191]As of February 4, 2011, the extension gallery featured more than 11,500 extensions,[192] including official extensions from the Independent,[193] CEOP,[194] Transport for London,[195] Cricinfo,[196] Web of Trust (WOT)[197] and FIFA.[198]Many Chrome extensions, once installed, have access to the user's data. There are three levels of permissions that an app or extension may request.[199]Starting with Google Chrome 3.0, users can install themes to alter the appearance of the browser.[200] Many free third-party themes are provided in an online gallery,[201] accessible through a "Get themes" button in Chrome's options.[202]Starting with Google Chrome 4.1 the application added a built-in translation bar using Google Translate. Translation is currently available for 52 languages.[203]On January 8, 2009, Google introduced a new release system with three distinct channels: Stable, Beta, and Developer preview (called the "Dev" channel). Before this change there were only two channels: Beta and Developer preview. All previous Developer channel users were moved to the Beta channel. The reason given by Google is that the Developer channel builds are less stable and polished than those that Developer channel users were getting during Google Chrome's Beta period. The stable channel will be updated with features and fixes once they have been thoroughly tested in the Beta channel, and the Beta channel will be updated roughly monthly with stable and complete features from the Developer channel. The Developer channel is where ideas get tested (and sometimes fail) and can be very unstable at times.[204][205] On July 22, 2010, Google announced it will ramp up the speed it will release new stable versions; they will shorten the release cycles from quarterly to 6 weeks.[206] The faster release cycle brought a fourth channel: the "Canary" release; the name refers to using canaries in coal mines, so if a change "kills" Chrome Canary, they will block it from the developer build. Canary will be "the most bleeding-edge official version of Chrome and somewhat of a mix between Chrome dev and the Chromium snapshot builds". Canary releases run side-by-side with any other channel; it is not linked to the other Google Chrome installation and can therefore run different synchronization profiles, themes, and browser preferences.[207] It does not include the option to be the default browser. Canary was Windows-only at first; a Mac OS X version was released on May 3, 2011.[208]Chrome automatically keeps itself up-to-date. The details differ by platform. On Windows, it uses Google Updater, and auto-update can be controlled via Group Policy,[209] or users can download a standalone version that does not autoupdate.[210][211] On Mac, it uses Google Update Service, and auto-update can be controlled via the Mac OS X "defaults" system.[212] On Linux, it lets the system's normal package management system supply the updates.Chrome supports color management by using the system provided ICC v2 and v4 support on OS X, and from version 22 supports ICC v2 profiles by default on other platforms.[93]Chrome is available for[213]As of 2012, 32-bit and 64-bit builds are available for Linux, with only 32-bit builds available for Mac OS X and Windows.[215][216]A beta version for Android 4.0 devices was launched on February 7, 2012, available for a limited number of countries from Google Play.[217]Notable features: synchronization with desktop Chrome to provide the same bookmarks and view the same browser tabs,[218] page pre-rendering,[219] hardware acceleration.[220]Many of the latest HTML5 features: almost all of the Web Platforms features: GPU-accelerated canvas, including CSS 3D Transforms, CSS animations, SVG, WebSocket (including binary messages), Dedicated Workers; it has overflow scroll support, strong HTML5 video support, and new capabilities such as IndexedDB, WebWorkers, Application Cache and the File APIs, date and time pickers, parts of the Media Capture API.[219][221] Also supports mobile oriented features such as Device Orientation and Geolocation.[221]Mobile customisations: swipe gesture tab switching,[218] link preview allows zooming in on (multiple) links to ensure the desired one is clicked,[218] font size boosting to ensure readability regardless of the zoom level.[221]Missing from the desktop version: sandboxed tabs,[219][222] Safe Browsing,[219] apps or extensions,[220] Adobe Flash (now and in future),[220] WebGL, Native Client.[220]Development changes: remote debugging,[219][223] part of the browser layer has been implemented in Java, communicating with the rest of the Chromium and WebKit code through Java Native Bindings.[221] The code of Chrome for Android is a fork of the Chromium project. It is a priority to upstream most new and modified code to Chromium and WebKit to resolve the fork.[221]The April 17, 2012 update included the availability to access in 31 additional languages and in all countries where Google Play is available. A desktop version of a website can also be requested as opposed to a mobile version. In addition, Android users can now add bookmarks to their Android home screens if they choose and decide which apps should handle links opened in Chrome.[224]On the June 27, 2012 Google Chrome for Android exited beta and became stable.[225]Chrome 18.0.1026311, released at September 26, 2012 was the first version of Chrome for Android to support Intel x86 based mobile devices.[226]Google Chrome is the basis of Google's Chrome OS operating system that ships on specific hardware from Google's manufacturing partners.[227] The user interface has a minimalist design resembling the Google Chrome browser. Chrome OS is aimed at users who spend most of their computer time on the Web; the only applications on the devices are a browser incorporating a media player and a file manager.[228][229][230][231][232]Google announced Chrome OS on July 7, 2009.[233]Google Chrome for iOS is the mobile rendition of Google's Chrome web browser for Apple's iOS operating system as its name implies. It was released on the App Store on June 26, 2012. It supports the iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch, and requires that the device have at least iOS version 4.3 installed.[234] Per Apple's requirements for browsers released through the App Store, this version of Chrome uses the iOS WebKit, that is the mobile Safari iOS engine and components, but restricted from using their Nitro JavaScript engine.[235]In a review by Chitika on July 18, 2012, Google Chrome was noted as having 1.5% of the iOS web browser market.[236]In June 2012, Google released the developers version of Chrome 21.[237] On Windows 8, this version of Chrome can be run in the Metro UI as long as it is set as the default browser on the computer. The Metro version of Chrome looks identical to its desktop counterpart and does not support the standard design principles of the Metro UI.In 2008, Matthew Moore in the The Daily Telegraph summarized the verdict of early reviewers: "Google Chrome is attractive, fast and has some impressive new features, but may not  yet  be a threat to its Microsoft rival."[239]Initially, Microsoft reportedly played down the threat from Chrome and predicted that most people will embrace Internet Explorer 8. Opera Software said that "Chrome will strengthen the Web as the biggest application platform in the world".[240] But by February 25, 2010, BusinessWeek had reported that "For the first time in years, energy and resources are being poured into browsers, the ubiquitous programs for accessing content on the Web. Credit for this trenda boon to consumersgoes to two parties. The first is Google, whose big plans for the Chrome browser have shaken Microsoft out of its competitive torpor and forced the software giant to pay fresh attention to its own browser, Internet Explorer. Microsoft all but ceased efforts to enhance IE after it triumphed in the last browser war, sending Netscape to its doom. Now it's back in gear."[241] Mozilla said that Chrome's introduction into the web browser market comes as "no real surprise", that "Chrome is not aimed at competing with Firefox", and furthermore that it would not affect Google's revenue relationship with Mozilla.[242][243]Chrome overtook Firefox in November 2011. As of September 2012[update], according to StatCounter, Google Chrome had 34% worldwide usage share, making it the most widely used web browser, while Internet Explorer had 33% and Firefox had 22%.[7][245]Along with Safari and Mozilla Firefox, Chrome receives a weekend "bump", which boosts its marketshare by as much as three percentage points on week-ends, at the expense of Internet Explorer.[246]It was reported by StatCounter, a web analytics company, that for the single day of Sunday, March 18, 2012 Chrome was the most used web browser in the world for the first time. Chrome secured 32.7% of the global web browsing on that day, while Internet Explorer followed closely behind with 32.5%.[247]From May 1421, 2012 Google Chrome was responsible for more Internet traffic than Microsoft's Internet Explorer (for the first time), which long had held its spot as the most used web browser in the world.[248] According to StatCounter, 31.88% of web traffic was generated by Chrome for a sustained period of one week and 31.47% by Internet Explorer. Though Chrome has topped Internet Explorer for single day's usage in the past, this is the first time it has led for one full week.[249]At the 2012 Google I/O developers' conference, Google claimed that there were 310 million active users of Chrome, almost double the number in 2011, which was stated as 160 million active users.[250]1 History

The Khan Academy is a non-profit[2] educational organization and a website created in 2006 by Bangladeshi-Indian-American [3] educator Salman Khan, a graduate of MIT and Harvard Business School. With the stated mission of "providing a high quality education to anyone, anywhere", the website supplies a free online collection of more than 3,600 micro lectures via video tutorials stored on YouTube teaching mathematics, history, healthcare and medicine, finance, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, economics, cosmology, organic chemistry, American civics, art history, macroeconomics, microeconomics, and computer science.[4] Khan Academy launched a computer science module in September 2012.[5][6] Khan Academy has delivered over 200 million lessons.[7]The founder of the organization, Salman Khan, was born to an Indian mother from Kolkata and a Bangladeshi father living in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States.[8] His father is from Barisal, Bangladesh.[9] After earning three degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (a BS in mathematics, a BS in electrical engineering and computer science, and an MS in electrical engineering and computer science), he pursued an MBA from Harvard Business School. In late 2004, Khan began tutoring his cousin Nadia in mathematics using Yahoo!'s Doodle notepad. When other relatives and friends sought similar help, he decided it would be more practical to distribute the tutorials on YouTube.[8][10] Their popularity there and the testimonials of appreciative students prompted Khan to quit his job in finance as a hedge fund analyst at Connective Capital Management in 2009, and focus on the tutorials (then released under the moniker "Khan Academy") full-time.[10] Bill Gates once said that "I'd say we've moved about 160 IQ points from the hedge fund category to the teaching-many-people-in-a-leveraged-way category. It was a good day his wife let him quit his job".[11]The project is funded by donations. Khan Academy can be a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization,[2] now with significant backing from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Google. Several people have made US$10,000 contributions; Ann and John Doerr gave $100,000; total revenue is about $150,000 in donations. Additionally, it earned $2,000 per month from ads on the website in 2010 until Khan Academy ceased to accept advertising.[12] In 2010, Google announced it would give the Khan Academy $2 million for creating more courses and for translating the core library into the worlds most widely spoken languages, as part of their Project 10100.[13]Khan Academy has eclipsed MIT's OpenCourseWare (OCW) in terms of videos viewed. Its YouTube channel has more than 202 million total views, compared to MIT's 43 million. It also has twice as many subscribers, at more than 429,000.[14][15][16]Khan Academy also had a language release in mid-2012. It was supported by volunteers[17] from Amara and included Indonesian, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Swahili, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Xhosa, Greek, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Urdu, Arabic, Persian, Bengali, Hindi, Chinese.The Khan Academy started with Khan remotely tutoring one of his cousins interactively using Yahoo Doodle images. Based on feedback from his cousin, additional cousins began to take advantage of the interactive, remote tutoring. In order to make better use of his and their time, Khan transitioned to making YouTube video tutorials.[18] Drawings are now made with a Wacom tablet and the free natural drawing application SmoothDraw 3, and recorded with screen capture software from Camtasia Studio.[19]All videos (hosted via YouTube) are available through Khan Academy's own website, which also contains many other features such as progress tracking, practice exercises, and a variety of tools for teachers in public schools. Logging into the site can be done via a Google or a Facebook account for those who do not want to create a separate Khan Academy account.Khan chose to avoid the standard format of a person standing by a whiteboard, deciding instead to present the learning concepts as if "popping out of a darkened universe and into one's mind with a voice out of nowhere" in a way akin to sitting next to someone and working out a problem on a sheet of paper: "If you're watching a guy do a problem [while] thinking out loud, I think people find that more valuable and not as daunting".[20] Offline versions of the videos have been distributed by not-for-profit groups to rural areas in Asia, Latin America, and Africa.[8][21] While the current content is mainly concerned with pre-college mathematics and physics, Khan's long-term goal is to provide "tens of thousands of videos in pretty much every subject" and to create "the world's first free, world-class virtual school where anyone can learn anything".[8]Khan Academy also provides a web-based exercise system that generates problems for students based on skill level and performance. The exercise software is available as open source under the MIT license.[22] Khan believes his academy points an opportunity to overhaul the traditional classroom by using software to create tests, grade assignments, highlight the challenges of certain students, and encourage those doing well to help struggling classmates.[10] The tutorials are touted as helpful because, among other factors, they can be paused by students, while a classroom lecture cannot be.[23]The success of his low-tech, conversational tutorialsKhan's face never appears, and viewers see only his unadorned step-by-step doodles and diagrams on an electronic blackboardsuggests an educational transformation that de-emphasizes lecture-based classroom interactions.[24]The major components of Khan Academy include:[25]Not-for-profit partner organizations are making the content available outside YouTube. The Lewis Center for Educational Research, which is affiliated with NASA, is bringing the content into community colleges and charter schools around the United States. World Possible is creating offline snapshots of the content to distribute in rural, developing regions with limited or no access to the Internet.[8][29]Khan has stated a vision of turning the academy into a charter school:This could be the DNA for a physical school where students spend 20 percent of their day watching videos and doing self-paced exercises and the rest of the day building robots or painting pictures or composing music or whatever.[12]A November 2011 grant of $5 million from Ireland-based The O'Sullivan Foundation, founded by Avego MD and cloud computing pioneer Sean O'Sullivan, will be directed to three initiatives:Recent teaching appointees as a result of the grant include Dr. Steven Zucker, formerly of Pratt Institute, and Dr. Beth Harris, from the Museum of Modern Art in New York, to produce art and history content. YouTube video creators Vi Hart and Brit Cruise have also joined the teaching faculty.[30]A series of summer school camps are planned to start in Northern California from June 2012 to test curricula for real-world schools.[31]There are both critics and proponents of Khan Academy, disagreeing on the actual effectiveness and potential that it has. Some critics have stated that the Khan videos are insubstantial, "repetitive," and "leave kids staring at screens" rather than promoting interaction and active engagement.[41] Although Salman Khan himself has addressed the fact that there is no "consistent, comprehensive plan" for revamping school courses, critics are unsure of the reliability and wide-spread application of Khan Academy.[42]There are many however, that support Khan Academy for it's technological ingenuity and it's ability to introduce different educational dynamics. The Khan Academy's ability to freely distribute lessons has demonstrated technology's ability eliminate economic barriers that prevent effective education. Since Benjamin Bloom's 1984 study on the effectiveness of "one-on-one tutoring," close student-teacher interaction has been aggressively sought after.[43] However, both the cost and the realistic implementation of this ideal has been an issue. Critics promote that the Khan Academy has addressed these issues, through both cost-free nature of the site and its wide accessibility via the internet.1 History2 Technical format3 Services and vision4 Educational Impact5 See also6 References7 External linksa video library with over 3600 videos in various topic areas and over 200 million lessons delivered.[26][27] These videos are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 License.[28]automated exercises with continuous assessment; as of November 2012[update], there are 380 practice exercises, mainly in math.peer-to-peer tutoring based on objective data collected by the system, a process that will be projected in the future.Salman Khan has been featured in the San Francisco Chronicle,[10] on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS),[4] National Public Radio, CNN,[32] and CNN Money.[24]In 2009, the Khan Academy received the Microsoft Tech Award for education.[21]In 2010 at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Bill Gates endorsed the learning resource, calling it "unbelievable" and saying "I've been using [Khan Academy] with my kids".[11][33]In 2010, Google's Project 10100 provided $2 million to support the creation of more courses, to allow for translation of the Khan Academy's content, and to allow for the hiring of additional staff.[34]In 2011, Salman Khan delivered a TED talk.[35]On 4 May 2011, Salman Khan appeared on Charlie Rose.[36]Salman Khan appeared on The Colbert Report on 2 June 2011.An article featuring Khan Academy and Salman Khan appeared in the August 2011 issue of Wired Magazine.[37]Salman Khan was featured as a "Big Thinker" on Edutopia discussing flip teaching.[38]In November 2011, the Khan Academy received a $5 million grant from the O'Sullivan Foundation.[39]In March 2012, Khan Academy was featured on CBS 60 Minutes.[40]In April 2012, Salman Khan was listed among the Time 100 Most Influential People for 2012The Khan Academy app features in many 'best educational apps' lists including this one from BBC Active: BBC Active's list of the best educational appsCourseraUdacityOpenCourseWareOpen educational resourcesOpen textbookBookboonChina Open Resources for EducationConnexionsCurrikiFlat World KnowledgeFlexbookFree High School Science Texts South AfricaLesson PlanetMIT OpenCourseWareNational Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning IndiaOpen.MichiganTufts OpenCourseWareKhan Academy HomepageKhan Academy's channel on YouTubeKhan Academy on FacebookBrowse Khan - Watch a Video/Jump to Playlist drop-down MenuKhan Academy videos(Physics,Chemistry and Biology) in BanglaKhan Academy videos overdubbed in ItalianIn the Media: Khan Academy-Related Talks and InterviewsThe 10 Most Innovative Companies in Education (Khan Academy #3)Notes on Khan Academy videoshttp://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7401696n, as seen on 60 Minutes, Sunday March 8, 2012.

Kansas (i/knzs/) is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States.[5] It is named after the Kansas River which flows through it, which in turn was named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area.[6] The tribe's name (natively kk:ze) is often said to mean "people of the wind" or "people of the south wind," although this was probably not the term's original meaning.[7][8] Residents of Kansas are called "Kansans." For thousands of years what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the Eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the Western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. Kansas was first settled by European Americans in the 1830s, but the pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the slavery issue.When officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854, abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine if Kansas would become a free state or a slave state. Thus, the area was a hotbed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known as Bleeding Kansas. The abolitionists eventually prevailed and on January 29, 1861,[9][10] Kansas entered the Union as a free state. After the Civil War, the population of Kansas grew rapidly, when waves of immigrants turned the prairie into farmland. Today, Kansas is one of the most productive agricultural states, producing high yields of wheat, sorghum and sunflowers.[11] Kansas is the 15th most extensive and the 33rd most populous of the 50 United States.For millennia, the land that is currently Kansas was inhabited by Native Americans. The first European to set foot in present-day Kansas was Francisco Vsquez de Coronado, who explored the area in 1541. In 1803, most of modern Kansas was secured by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Southwest Kansas, however, was still a part of Spain, Mexico and the Republic of Texas until the conclusion of the Mexican-American War in 1848. From 1812 to 1821, Kansas was part of the Missouri Territory. The Santa Fe Trail traversed Kansas from 1821 to 1880, transporting manufactured goods from Missouri and silver and furs from Santa Fe, New Mexico. Wagon ruts from the trail are still visible in the prairie today.In 1827, Fort Leavenworth became the first permanent settlement of white Americans in the future state. The Kansas-Nebraska Act became law on May 30, 1854, establishing the U.S. territories of Nebraska and Kansas, and opening the area to broader settlement by whites. Kansas Territory stretched all the way to the Continental Divide and included the sites of present-day Denver, Colorado Springs, and Pueblo.Missouri and Arkansas sent settlers into Kansas all along its eastern border. These settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery. The secondary settlement of Americans in Kansas Territory were abolitionists from Massachusetts and other Free-Staters, who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring Missouri. Directly presaging the American Civil War, these forces collided, entering into skirmishes that earned the territory the name of Bleeding Kansas.Kansas was admitted to the United States as a slave-free state on January 29, 1861, making it the 34th state to enter the Union. By that time the violence in Kansas had largely subsided. But, during the Civil War, on August 21, 1863, William Quantrill led several hundred men on a raid into Lawrence, destroying much of the city and killing nearly 200 people. He was roundly condemned by both the conventional Confederate military and the partisan rangers commissioned by the Missouri legislature. His application to that body for a commission was flatly rejected due to his pre-war criminal record.[12]After the Civil War, many veterans constructed homesteads in Kansas. Many African Americans also looked to Kansas as the land of "John Brown" and, led by freedmen like Benjamin "Pap" Singleton, began establishing black colonies in the state. Leaving southern states in the late 1870s because of increasing discrimination, they became known as Exodusters.At the same time, the Chisholm Trail was opened and the Wild West-era commenced in Kansas. Wild Bill Hickok was a deputy marshal at Fort Riley and a marshal at Hays and Abilene. Dodge City was another wild cowboy town, and both Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp worked as lawmen in the town. In one year alone, 8 million head of cattle from Texas boarded trains in Dodge City bound for the East, earning Dodge the nickname "Queen of the Cowtowns."In part as a response to the violence perpetrated by cowboys, on February 19, 1881 Kansas became the first U.S. state to adopt a Constitutional amendment prohibiting all alcoholic beverages.Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north; Missouri on the east; Oklahoma on the south; and Colorado on the west. The state is divided into 105 counties with 628 cities, and is located equidistant from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The geographic center of the 48 contiguous states is located in Smith County near Lebanon. The geodetic center of North America was located in Meades Ranch, Kansas, Osborne County until 1983. This spot was used until that date as the central reference point for all maps of North America produced by the U.S. government. The geographic center of Kansas is located in Barton County.Kansas is underlain by a sequence of horizontal to gently westward dipping sedimentary rocks. A sequence of Mississippian, Pennsylvanian and Permian rocks underlie the eastern and southern part of the state. The western half of the state consists of Cretaceous through Tertiary sediments derived from the erosion of the uplifted Rocky Mountains to the west. The northeastern corner of the state was subjected to glaciation in the Pleistocene and is covered by glacial drift and loess.The western two-thirds of the state, lying in the great central plain of the United States, has a generally flat or undulating surface, while the eastern third has many hills and forests. The land gradually rises from east to west; its altitude ranges from 684ft (208m) along the Verdigris River at Coffeyville in Montgomery County, to 4,039ft (1,231m) at Mount Sunflower, one half mile from the Colorado border, in Wallace County. It is a popular belief that Kansas is the flattest state in the nation, reinforced by a well-known 2003 study[13] stating that Kansas was indeed "flatter than a pancake".[14] This has since been called into question, with most scientists ranking Kansas somewhere between 20th and 30th flattest state, depending on measurement method. Its average elevation is 2,000 feet, higher than 36 states.[15]The Missouri River forms nearly 75mi (121km) of the state's northeastern boundary. The Kansas River (locally known as the Kaw), formed by the junction of the Smoky Hill and Republican rivers at appropriately-named Junction City, joins the Missouri at Kansas City, after a course of 170mi (270km) across the northeastern part of the state. The Arkansas River (pronunciation varies), rising in Colorado, flows with a bending course for nearly 500mi (800km) across the western and southern parts of the state. It forms, with its tributaries (the Little Arkansas, Ninnescah, Walnut, Cow Creek, Cimarron, Verdigris, and the Neosho), the southern drainage system of the state. Other important rivers are the Saline and Solomon Rivers, tributaries of the Smoky Hill River; the Big Blue, Delaware, and Wakarusa, which flow into the Kansas River; and the Marais des Cygnes, a tributary of the Missouri River. Spring River is located between Riverton (Fuglies), Kansas and Baxter Springs, Kansas.Areas under the protection of the National Park Service include:[16]Kansas contains three climatic types, according to the Kppen climate classification: it has humid continental, semi-arid steppe, and humid subtropical. The eastern two-thirds of the state (especially the northeastern portion) has a humid continental climate, with cool to cold winters and hot, often humid summers. Most of the precipitation falls in the summer and spring. The western third of the state  from roughly the U.S. Route 281 corridor westward  has a semiarid steppe climate. Summers are hot, often very hot, and generally less humid. Winters are highly changeable between warm and very cold. The western region receives an average of about 16 inches (410mm) of precipitation per year. Chinook winds in the winter can warm western Kansas all the way into the 80 F (27 C) range. The far south-central and southeastern reaches of the state have a humid subtropical climate with hot, humid summers, milder winters and more precipitation than elsewhere in Kansas. Although not strictly falling in all of the zones, some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state, with droughts and changeable weather between dry and humid not uncommon, and both warm and cold spells in the winter.Precipitation ranges from about 47inches (1200mm) annually in the southeast corner of the state, to about 16inches (400mm) in the southwest. Snowfall ranges from around 5inches (130mm) in the fringes of the south, to 35inches (900mm) in the far northwest. Frost-free days range from more than 200 days in the south, to 130 days in the northwest. Thus, Kansas is the ninth or tenth sunniest state in the country, depending on the source. Western Kansas is as sunny as California and Arizona.Kansas is prone to severe weather, especially in the spring and early summer. In spite of the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state, due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to multiple air masses the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunderstorms. Many of these storms become Supercell thunderstorms. These can spawn tornadoes, often of EF3 strength or higher. According to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center, Kansas has reported more tornadoes (for the period January 1, 1950 through October 31, 2006) than any state except for Texas  marginally even more than Oklahoma. It has also  along with Alabama  reported more F5 or EF5 tornadoes than any other state. These are the most powerful of all tornadoes. Kansas averages over 50 tornadoes annually.[17] Severe thunderstorms sometimes drop very large hail over Kansas as well as bringing flash flooding and damaging straight line winds.According to NOAA, the all-time highest temperature recorded in Kansas is 121 F (49.4 C) on July 24, 1936, near Alton, and the all-time low is 40 F (40 C) on February 13, 1905, near Lebanon.Kansas's record high of 121 F (49.4 C) ties with North Dakota for the fifth-highest record high in an American state, behind California (134 F/56.7 C), Arizona (128 F/53.3 C), Nevada (125 F/51.7 C), and New Mexico (122 F/50 C).The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Kansas was 2,871,238 on July 1, 2011, a 0.6% increase since the 2010 United States Census.[2] According to the 2010 Census, 83.8% of the population was White (78.2% non-Hispanic white), 5.9% was Black or African American, 1.0% American Indian and Alaska Native, 2.4% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 3.0% from two or more races. 10.5% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race).[19]As of 2007, Kansas had an estimated population of 2,775,997, an increase of 20,180, or 0.7%, from the prior year and an increase of 87,579, or 3.3%, since the year 2000.[20] This includes a natural increase since the last census of 93,899 people (that is 246,484 births minus 152,585 deaths) and a decrease due to net migration of 20,742 people out of the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 44,847 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 65,589 people.[21] The population density of the state is 52.9 people per square mile.[22] The center of population of Kansas is located in Chase County, at 3827N 9632W / 38.45N 96.533W / 38.45; -96.533, approximately three miles north of the community of Strong City.[23]As of 2004, the population included 149,800 foreign-born (5.5% of the state population). The ten largest reported ancestry groups, which account for over 85% of the population, in the state are: German (33.75%), Irish (14.4%), English (14.1%), American (7.5%), French (4.4%), Scottish (4.2%), Dutch (2.5%), Swedish (2.4%), Italian (1.8%), and Polish (1.5%).[24] People of German ancestry are especially strong in the northwest, while those of English ancestry and descendants of white Americans from other states are especially strong in the southeast. Mexicans are present in the southwest and make up nearly half the population in certain counties. Many African Americans in Kansas are descended from the Exodusters, newly freed blacks who fled the South for land in Kansas following the Civil War.The 2008 Pew Religious Landscape Survey showed the religious makeup of Kansas was as follows:As of the year 2000, the RCMS[25] reported that the three largest denominational groups in Kansas are Mainline Protestant, Evangelical Protestant, and Catholic. The Catholic Church has the highest number of adherents in Kansas (at 405,844), followed by the United Methodist Church with 206,187 members, and the Southern Baptist Convention, reporting 101,696 adherents.The Kansas Baha'i community has the distinction of being the second in the western hemisphere, founded in 1897 in Enterprise, Kansas.[26] In 2012 it was reported there has been a growth in Mormons and Catholics.[27]Known as rural flight, the last few decades have been marked by a migratory pattern out of the countryside into cities. Out of all the cities in these Midwestern states, 89% have fewer than 3,000 people, and hundreds of those have fewer than 1,000. In Kansas alone, there are more than 6,000 ghost towns and dwindling communities,[28] according to one Kansas historian, Daniel C. Fitzgerald. At the same time, some of the communities in Johnson County (metropolitan Kansas City) are among the fastest-growing in the country.The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that the total GDP in 2008 was $122.7billion, making it the United States's 32nd highest state by GDP.[29] Per capita personal income in 2008 was $35,013. As of January 2010, the state's unemployment rate is 6.4%.[30]The agricultural outputs of the state are cattle, sheep, wheat, sorghum, soybeans, cotton, hogs, corn, and salt. Eastern Kansas is part of the Grain Belt, an area of major grain production in the central United States. The industrial outputs are transportation equipment, commercial and private aircraft, food processing, publishing, chemical products, machinery, apparel, petroleum and mining.Kansas ranks 8th in U.S. oil production. Production has experienced a steady, natural decline as it becomes increasingly difficult to extract oil over time. Since oil prices bottomed in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained fairly constant, with an average monthly rate of about 2.8 million barrels (450,000m3) in 2004. The recent higher prices have made carbon dioxide sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical.Kansas ranks 8th in U.S. natural gas production. Production has steadily declined since the mid-1990s with the gradual depletion of the Hugoton Natural Gas Fieldthe state's largest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased coalbed methane production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over 32billion cubic feet (0.9km).The Kansas economy is also heavily influenced by the aerospace industry. Several large aircraft corporations have manufacturing facilities in Wichita and Kansas City, including Spirit AeroSystems, Boeing, Cessna, Learjet, and Hawker Beechcraft (formerly Raytheon).Major company headquarters in Kansas include the Sprint Nextel Corporation (with world headquarters in Overland Park), Embarq (with national headquarters in Overland Park), YRC Worldwide (Overland Park), Garmin (Olathe), Payless Shoes (national headquarters and major distribution facilities in Topeka), and Koch Industries (with national headquarters in Wichita).Kansas has three income brackets for income tax calculation, ranging from 3.5% to 6.45%. The state sales tax in Kansas is 6.3%. Various cities and counties in Kansas have an additional local sales tax. Except during the 2001 recession (MarchNovember 2001) when monthly sales tax collections were flat, collections have trended higher as the economy has grown and two rate increases have been enacted. Total sales tax collections for 2003 amounted to $1.63billion, compared to $805.3million in 1990.Revenue shortfalls resulting from lower than expected tax collections and slower growth in personal income following a 1998 permanent tax reduction has contributed to the substantial growth in the state's debt level as bonded debt increased from $1.16billion in 1998 to $3.83billion in 2006. Some increase in debt was expected as the state continues with its 10-year Comprehensive Transportation Program enacted in 1999. As of June 2004, Moody's Investors Service ranked the state 14th for net tax-supported debt per capita. As a percentage of personal income, it was at 3.8%above the median value of 2.5% for all rated states and having risen from a value of less than 1% in 1992. The state has a statutory requirement to maintain cash reserves of at least 7.5% of expenses at the end of each fiscal year, however, lawmakers can vote to override the rule, and did so during the most recent budget agreement.Kansas is served by two Interstate highways with one beltway, two spur routes, and three bypasses, with over a total of 874 miles (1,407km) in all. The first section of Interstate in the nation was opened on I-70 just west of Topeka on November 14, 1956. I-70 is a major east/west route connecting to St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, in the east and Denver, Colorado, in the west. Cities along this route (from east to west) include Kansas City, Lawrence, Topeka, Junction City, Salina, Hays, and Colby. I-35 is a major north/south route connecting to Des Moines, Iowa, in the north and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in the south. Cities along this route (from north to south) include Kansas City (and suburbs), Ottawa, Emporia, El Dorado, and Wichita.Spur routes serve as connections between the two major routes. I-135, a north/south route, connects I-70 at Salina to I-35 at Wichita. I-335, a northeast/southwest route, connects I-70 at Topeka to I-35 at Emporia. I-335 and portions of I-35 and I-70 make up the Kansas Turnpike. Bypasses include I-470 around Topeka, I-235 around Wichita, and I-670 in downtown Kansas City, Kansas. I-435 is a beltway around the Kansas City Metropolitan Area while I-635 bypasses through Kansas City, Kansas.US Route 69 runs north and south, from Minnesota to Texas. The highway passes through the eastern section of Kansas, from the Kansas City area, through Louisburg, Fort Scott, Frontenac, Pittsburg, and Baxter Springs before entering Oklahoma.Kansas also has the second largest state highway system in the country after California. This is because of the high number of counties and county seats (105) and the intertwining of them all.In January 2004, the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) announced the new Kansas 511 traveler information service.[32] By dialing 511, callers will get access to information about road conditions, construction, closures, detours and weather conditions for the state highway system. Weather and road condition information is updated every 15 minutes.The state's only major commercial (Class C) airport is Wichita Mid-Continent Airport, located along US-54 on the western edge of the city. Manhattan Regional Airport in Manhattan offers daily flights to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, making it the second-largest commercial airport in the state.[33] Most air travelers in northeastern Kansas fly out of Kansas City International Airport, located in Platte County, Missouri. For those in the far western part of the state, Denver International Airport is a popular option. Connecting flights are also available from smaller Kansas airports in Dodge City, Garden City, Great Bend, Hays, Hutchinson, and Salina. Forbes Field in Topeka sustained commercial flights on Allegiant Air for short period of time until that service was terminated in 2007.Executive branch: The executive branch consists of six elected officers. The Governor and Lt Governor are elected on the same slate, the Attorney General, Secretary of State, State Treasurer, and State Insurance Commissioner are elected separately. The six top executive offices of Kansas are all Republican. Governor Sam Brownback and Lieutenant Governor Jeff Colyer were elected in 2010 on the same ticket to a maximum of two consecutive four-year terms. Also elected in 2010 were the Attorney General Derek Schmidt of Independence; the Secretary of State Kris Kobach, of Kansas City; the State Treasurer Ron Estes, of Wichita; and the Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger, of Topeka.Legislative branch: The bicameral Kansas Legislature consists of the Kansas House of Representatives, with 125 members serving two-year terms, and the Kansas Senate, with 40 members serving four-year terms. Currently, 32 of the 40 Senators are Republican and 92 of the 125 Representatives are Republican.Judicial branch: The Judicial branch of the state government is headed by the Kansas Supreme Court. The court has seven judges. A vacancy is filled by the Governor picking one of three nominees selected by a 9-member judicial selection board. The board consists of five Kansas lawyers elected by other Kansas lawyers and four members selected by the Governor.Kansas has a reputation as a progressive state with many firsts in legislative initiativesit was the first state to institute a system of workers' compensation (1910) and to regulate the securities industry (1911). Kansas also permitted women's suffrage in 1912, almost a decade before the federal constitution was amended to require it. Suffrage in all states would not be guaranteed until ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920. The council-manager government was adopted by many larger Kansas cities in the years following World War I while many American cities were being run by political machines or organized crime, notably the Pendergast Machine in neighboring Kansas City, Missouri. Kansas was also at the center of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, a 1954 Supreme Court decision that banned racially segregated schools throughout the U.S.Kansas was one of the few states in which Franklin D. Roosevelt had limited political support, winning Kansas only twice in his four campaigns, although he won the state over Kansas governor Alfred M. Landon during the landslide of 1936. The state backed Republicans Wendell Willkie and Thomas E. Dewey in 1940 and 1944, respectively. Kansas also supported Dewey in 1948 despite the presence of incumbent president Harry S. Truman, who hailed from Independence, Missouri, approximately 15 miles east of the Kansas-Missouri state line. Since FDR carried Kansas in 1932 and 1936, only one Democrat has won Kansas' electoral votes, Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.Over the past four decades, Kansas has remained more socially conservative than many parts of the nation. The 1990s brought new restrictions on abortion, the defeat of prominent Democrats, including Dan Glickman, and the Kansas State Board of Education's 1999 decision to eliminate evolution from the state teaching standards, a decision that was later reversed.[34] In 2005, voters accepted a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. The next year, the state passed a law setting a minimum age for marriage at 15 years.[35] In 2008, Governor Sebelius vetoed permits for the construction of new coal-fired energy plants in Kansas, saying: "We know that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change. As an agricultural state, Kansas is particularly vulnerable. Therefore, reducing pollutants benefits our state not only in the short term  but also for generations of Kansans to come."[36] However, shortly after Mark Parkinson became governor in 2009 upon Sebelius's resignation to become Secretary of U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Parkinson announced a compromise plan to allow construction of a coal-fired plant.In 2010, Sam Brownback was elected governor with 63 percent of the state vote. He was sworn in as governor in 2011, Kansas' first Republican governor in eight years. Brownback campaigned on a five-point Road Map for Kansas, which consisted of five quantifiable objectives:For the 2012 legislative session, Brownback has identified five major objectives:Brownback had established himself as a very conservative member of the U.S. Senate in years prior, but since becoming governor has made several controversial decisions. In May 2011, much to the opposition of art leaders and enthusiasts in the state, Brownback eliminated the Kansas Arts Commission, making Kansas the first state without an arts agency.[37] In July 2011, Brownback announced plans to close the Lawrence branch of the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services as a cost-saving measure. Hundreds rallied against the decision.[38] Lawrence City Commission later voted to provide the funding needed to keep the branch open.[39]The state's current delegation to the Congress of the United States includes Republican Senators Pat Roberts of Dodge City and Jerry Moran of Manhattan; and Republican Representatives Tim Huelskamp of Fowler (District 1), Lynn Jenkins of Topeka (District 2), Kevin Yoder of Overland Park (District 3), and Mike Pompeo of Wichita (District 4).Historically, Kansas has been strongly Republican, dating from the Antebellum age when the Republican Party was created out of the movement opposing the extension of slavery into Kansas Territory. Kansas has not elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate since the 1932 election, when Franklin D. Roosevelt won his first term as President in the wake of the Great Depression. This is the longest Senate losing streak for either party in a single state. Senator Sam Brownback was a candidate for the Republican party nomination for President in 2008. Brownback was not a candidate for re-election to a third full term in 2010, but he was elected Governor in that year's general election. Moran defeated Tiahrt for the Republican nomination for Brownback's seat in the August 2010 primary, then won a landslide general election victory over Democrat Lisa Johnston.The only non-Republican presidential candidates Kansas has given its electoral vote to are Populist James Weaver and Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt (twice), and Lyndon Johnson. In 2004, George W. Bush won the state's six electoral votes by an overwhelming margin of 25 percentage points with 62% of the vote. The only two counties to support Democrat John Kerry in that election were Wyandotte, which contains Kansas City, and Douglas, home to the University of Kansas, located in Lawrence. The 2008 election brought similar results as John McCain won the state with 57% of the votes. Douglas, Wyandotte, and Crawford County were the only counties in support of President Barack Obama.[40]In 1996, when Kansas Republican Senator Bob Dole failed in his bid to become President on the party's national ticket, the state became the second in the nation (following Minnesota and preceding Arizona by identical twelve-year intervals) to produce two losing major-party presidential candidates, and the first in which the said candidates ran on the GOP ticket (following Alfred Landon's loss to FDR in 1936).The legal drinking age in Kansas is 21. In lieu of the state retail sales tax, a 10% Liquor Drink Tax is collected for liquor consumed on the licensed premises and an 8% Liquor Enforcement Tax is collected on retail purchases. Although the sale of cereal malt beverage (also known as 3.2 beer) was legalized in 1937, the first post-Prohibition legalization of alcoholic liquor did not occur until the state's constitution was amended in 1948. The following year the Legislature enacted the Liquor Control Act which created a system of regulating, licensing, and taxing, and the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) was created to enforce the act. The power to regulate cereal malt beverage remains with the cities and counties. Liquor-by-the-drink did not become legal until passage of an amendment to the state's constitution in 1986 and additional legislation the following year. As of November 2006, Kansas still has 29 dry counties and only 17 counties have passed liquor-by-the-drink with no food sales requirement.[41] Today there are more than 2600 liquor and 4000 cereal malt beverage licensees in the state.[42]Kansas has 627 incorporated cities. By state statute, cities are divided into three classes as determined by the population obtained "by any census of enumeration." A city of the third class has a population of less than 5,000, but cities reaching a population of more than 2,000 may be certified as a city of the second class. The second class is limited to cities with a population of less than 25,000, and upon reaching a population of more than 15,000, they may be certified as a city of the first class. First and second class cities are independent of any township and are not included within the township's territory.The northeastern portion of the state, extending from the Eastern border to Junction City and from the Nebraska border to south of Johnson County is home to more than 1.5million people in the Kansas City (Kansas portion), Manhattan, Lawrence,and Topeka metropolitan areas. Overland Park, a young city incorporated in 1960, has the largest population and the largest land area in the county. It is home to Johnson County Community College, the state's largest community college, and the corporate campus of Sprint Nextel, the largest private employer in the metro area. In 2006 the city was ranked as the 6th best place to live in America; the neighboring city of Olathe was 13th.[44] Olathe is the county seat and home to Johnson County Executive Airport. The cities of Olathe, Shawnee, and Gardner have some of the state's fastest growing populations. The cities of Overland Park, Lenexa, Olathe, and Gardner are also notable because they lie along the former route of the Santa Fe Trail. Among cities with at least one thousand residents, Mission Hills has the highest median income in the state.Several institutions of higher education are located in Northeast Kansas including Baker University (the oldest university in the state, founded in 1858 and affiliated with the United Methodist Church) in Baldwin City, Benedictine College (sponsored by St. Benedict's Abbey and Mount St. Scholastica Monastery and formed from the merger of St. Benedict's College (1858) and Mount St. Scholastica College (1923)) in Atchison, MidAmerica Nazarene University in Olathe, Ottawa University in Ottawa and Overland Park, Kansas City Kansas Community College and KU Medical Center in Kansas City, and KU Edwards Campus in Overland Park. Less than an hour's drive to the west, Lawrence is home to the University of Kansas, the largest public university in the state, and Haskell Indian Nations University.To the north, Kansas City, Kansas, with the second largest land area in the state, contains a number of diverse ethnic neighborhoods. Its attractions include the Kansas Speedway, Kansas City T-Bones and The Legends at Village West retail and entertainment center. Further up the Missouri River, the city of Lansing is the home of the state's first maximum-security prison. Historic Leavenworth, founded in 1854, was the first incorporated city in Kansas. North of the city, Fort Leavenworth is the oldest active Army post west of the Mississippi River. The city of Atchison was an early commercial center in the state and is well known as the birthplace of Amelia Earhart.To the west, nearly a quarter million people reside in the Topeka metropolitan area. Topeka is the state capital and home to Washburn University. Built at a Kansas River crossing along the old Oregon Trail, this historic city has several nationally registered historic places. Further westward along Interstate 70 and the Kansas River is Junction City with its historic limestone and brick buildings and nearby Fort Riley, well known as the home to the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division, also known as the "Big Red One". A short distance away, the city of Manhattan is home to Kansas State University, the second largest public university in the state and the nation's oldest land-grant university, dating back to 1863. South of the campus, Aggieville dates back to 1889 and is the state's oldest shopping district of its kind.In south-central Kansas, the Wichita metropolitan area is home to over 600,000 people. Wichita is the largest city in the state in terms of both land area and population. 'The Air Capital' is a major manufacturing center for the aircraft industry and the home of Wichita State University. With a number of nationally registered historic places, museums, and other entertainment destinations, it has a desire to become a cultural mecca in the Midwest. Wichita's population growth has grown by double digits and the surrounding suburbs are among the fastest growing cities in the state. The population of Goddard has grown by more than 11% per year since 2000.[45] Other fast-growing cities include Andover, Maize, Park City, Derby, and Haysville.Up river (the Arkansas River) from Wichita is the city of Hutchinson. The city was built on one of the world's largest salt deposits, and it has the world's largest and longest wheat elevator. It is also the home of Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center, Prairie Dunes Country Club and the Kansas State Fair. North of Wichita along Interstate 135 is the city of Newton, the former western terminal of the Santa Fe Railroad and trailhead for the famed Chisholm Trail. To the southeast of Wichita are the cities of Winfield and Arkansas City with historic architecture and the Cherokee Strip Museum (in Ark City). The city of Udall was the site of the deadliest tornado in Kansas on May 25, 1955; it killed 80 people in and near the city.[46] To the southwest of Wichita is Freeport, the state's smallest incorporated city (population 5).Located midway between Kansas City, Topeka, and Wichita in the heart of the Bluestem Region of the Flint Hills, the city of Emporia has several nationally registered historic places and is the home of Emporia State University, well known for its Teachers College. It was also the home of newspaper man William Allen White.Southeast KansasSoutheast Kansas has a unique history with a number of nationally registered historic places in this coal-mining region. Located in Crawford County (dubbed the Fried Chicken Capital of Kansas), Pittsburg is the largest city in the region and the home of Pittsburg State University. The neighboring city of Frontenac in 1888 was the site of the worst mine disaster in the state in which an underground explosion killed 47 miners. "Big Brutus" is located a mile and a half outside the city of West Mineral. Along with the restored fort, historic Fort Scott has a national cemetery designated by President Lincoln in 1862.Central and North-Central KansasSalina is the largest city in central and north-central Kansas. South of Salina is the small city of Lindsborg with its numerous Dala horses. Much of the architecture and decor of this town has a distinctly Swedish style. To the east along Interstate 70, the historic city of Abilene was formerly a trailhead for the Chisholm Trail and was the boyhood home of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and is the site of his Presidential Library and the tombs of the former President, First Lady and son who died in infancy. To the west is Lucas, the Grassroots Art Capital of Kansas.Northwest KansasWestward along the Interstate, the city of Russell, traditionally the beginning of sparsely-populated northwest Kansas, is the home of former U.S. Senator Bob Dole and the boyhood home of U.S. Senator Arlen Specter. The city of Hays is home to Fort Hays State University and the Sternberg Museum of Natural History, and is the largest city in the northwest with a population of around 20,000. Two other landmarks are located in smaller towns in Ellis County: the "Cathedral of the Plains" is located 10 miles (16km) east of Hays in Victoria, and the boyhood home of Walter Chrysler is 15 miles (24km) west of Hays in Ellis. West of Hays, population drops dramatically, even in areas along I-70, and only two towns containing populations of more than 4,000: Colby and Goodland, which are located 35 miles apart along I-70.Southwest KansasDodge City, famously known for the cattle drive days of the late 19th century, was built along the old Santa Fe Trail route. The city of Liberal is located along the southern Santa Fe Trail route. The first wind farm in the state was built east of Montezuma. Garden City has the Lee Richardson Zoo.Education in Kansas is governed at the primary and secondary school level by the Kansas State Board of Education. The state's public colleges and universities are supervised by the Kansas Board of Regents.Twice since 1999 the Board of Education has approved changes in the state science curriculum standards that encouraged the teaching of intelligent design. Both times, the standards were reversed after changes in the composition of the board in the next election.Sporting Kansas City, who have played their home games at CommunityAmerica Ballpark since 2008, are the first top-tier professional sports league and first Major League Soccer team to be located within Kansas. In 2011 the team moved to their new home in Livestrong Sporting Park, a brand new $165m soccer specific stadium.Historically, many Kansans have supported the major league sports teams of Kansas City, Missouri, including the Kansas City Royals (MLB), the Kansas City Chiefs (NFL) and the Kansas City Brigade (AFL)  in part because the home stadiums for these teams are just miles from the Kansas border. The Chiefs and the Royals play at the Truman Sports Complex, located about 10 miles (16km) from the Kansas-Missouri state line. The Kansas City Brigade play in the newly opened Sprint Center, which is even closer to the state line. From 1973 to 1997 the flagship radio station for the Royals was WIBW in Topeka, Kansas.[47]Western Kansans sometimes also support the major league teams from Denver, while those who live close to the Oklahoma state line may support the Dallas Cowboys. All Chiefs games are televised throughout Kansas by television stations in Topeka and Wichita.Two major auto racing facilities are located in Kansas. The Kansas Speedway located in Kansas City hosts races of the NASCAR, IRL, and ARCA circuits. Also, the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) holds drag racing events at Heartland Park Topeka. The Sports Car Club of America has its national headquarters in Topeka.The history of professional sports in Kansas probably dates from the establishment of the minor league baseball Topeka Capitals and Leavenworth Soldiers in 1886 in the Western League.[48][49] The African-American Bud Fowler played on the Topeka team that season, one year before the "color line" descended in professional baseball.[49]In 1887, the Western League was dominated by a reorganized Topeka team called the Golden Giants  a high-priced collection of major leaguer players, including Bug Holliday, Jim Conway, Dan Stearns, Perry Werden and Jimmy Macullar, which won the league by 15 games.[49] On April 10, 1887, the Golden Giants also won an exhibition game from the defending World Series champions, the St. Louis Browns (the present-day Cardinals), by a score of 129. However, Topeka was unable to support the team, and it disbanded after one year.The governing body for intercollegiate sports in the United States, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), was headquartered in the Kansas City suburb of Mission from 1973 until moving to Indianapolis in 1999.While there are no franchises of the four major professional sports within the state, many Kansans are fans of the state's major college sports teams, especially the Jayhawks of the University of Kansas, commonly referred to as "KU", and the Wildcats of Kansas State University, known as "KSU" or "K-State". Wichita State University, which also fields teams (called the Shockers) in Division I of the NCAA, is best known for its baseball program, winning the College World Series in 1989.Both KU and K-State have tradition-rich programs in men's basketball. The Jayhawks are a perennial national power, ranking second in all-time victories among NCAA programs, behind Kentucky. In 2008, the Jayhawks won their fifth national crown (third NCAA tournament title). K-State also had a long stretch of success on the hardwood, lasting from the 1940s to the 1980s. After a 12-year absence, the Wildcats returned to the NCAA tournament in 2008 and made it into the Elite Eight in 2010. KU is fifth all-time with 14 Final Four appearances, while K-State is tied for 17th with four appearances. Wichita State has also made one Final Four appearance.However, success on the gridiron has been less frequent for both KSU and KU. When the two teams met in 1987, KU's record was 17 and K-State's was 08. Fittingly, the Governor's Cup that year, dubbed the "Toilet Bowl" by the media, ended in a 1717 tie when the Jayhawks blocked a last-second K-State field goal attempt. However, there have been recent breakthroughs for both schools. KU won the Orange Bowl for the first time in three tries in 2008, capping a 121 season, the best in school history. And when Bill Snyder arrived to coach at KSU in 1989, he turned the Wildcats from one of the worst college football programs in the nation into a national force for most of the 1990s and early 2000s. The team won the Fiesta Bowl in 1997, achieved an undefeated (110) regular season and No. 1 ranking in 1998, and took the Big 12 Conference championship in 2003.Notable success has also been achieved by the state's smaller schools in football. Pittsburg State University, a NCAA Division II participant, has claimed four national titles in football, two in the NAIA and most recently the 2011 NCAA Division II national title. Pittsburg State became the winningest NCAA Division II football program in 1995. PSU passed Hillsdale College at the top of the all-time victories list in the 1995 season on its march to the national runner-up finish. The Gorillas, in 96 seasons of intercollegiate competition, have accumulated 579 victories  posting a 57930148 overall mark.Washburn University, in Topeka, won the NAIA Men's Basketball Championship in 1987. The Fort Hays State University men won the 1996 NCAA Division II title with a 340 record, and the Washburn women won the 2005 NCAA Division II crown. St. Benedict's College (now Benedictine College), in Atchison, won the 1954 and 1967 Men's NAIA Basketball Championships.The Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference has its roots as one of the oldest college sport conferences in existence and participates in the NAIA and all ten member schools are in the state of Kansas. Other smaller school conference that have some members in Kansas are the Heartland Conference, the Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference, the Midwest Christian College Conference, and the Heart of America Athletic Conference. Many junior colleges also have active athletic programs.The Kansas State High School Activities Association (KSHSAA) is the organization which oversees interscholastic competition in the state of Kansas at the high school level. It oversees both athletic and non-athletic competition, and sponsors championships in several sports and activities.The rock band Kansas was formed in the state capital of Topeka, the hometown of several of the band's members.Singers from Kansas include Leavenworth native Melissa Etheridge, Sharon native Martina McBride, Chanute native Jennifer Knapp (whose first album was titled Kansas) and Kansas City native Janelle Mone.Kansas as a generic location, with no references to any specific town, was the home of the main character in the novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.The 1965 best-seller In Cold Blood, described by its author Truman Capote as a "nonfiction novel", chronicles the events and aftermath of the 1959 murder of a wealthy farmer and his family who lived in the small West Kansas town of Holcomb in Finney County.The city of Lawrence is the setting for a number of science fiction writer James Gunn's novels.As was the case with the novel, the main character in the 1939 fantasy film The Wizard of Oz was a teenage girl who lived in Kansas.The 1967 feature film In Cold Blood, like the book on which it was based, was set in various locations across Kansas. Many of the scenes in the film were filmed at the exact locations where the events profiled in the book took place. A 1996 made-for-television miniseries was also based on the book.The 2005 film Capote, for which Philip Seymour Hoffman was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the title character, profiled the author as he traveled across Kansas while writing In Cold Blood (although most of the film itself was shot in the Canadian province of Manitoba).The setting of The Day After, a 1983 made-for-television movie about a fictional nuclear attack, was the city of Lawrence.Clark Kent's home town of Smallville KS was in the beginning of Superman (film).The protagonist brothers of the 2005 TV show Supernatural hail from Lawrence, with the city referenced numerous times on the show.The town of Lawrence was destroyed in the 2006 TV Series Jericho.Early seasons of Smallville, about Superman as a teenager, were based in a fictional town in Kansas.Coordinates: 3830N 9800W / 38.5N 98W / 38.5; -981 History2 Geography

Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that deals with the physical properties of condensed phases of matter.[1] Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using well-established physical laws. In particular, these include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics.The most familiar condensed phases are solids and liquids, while more exotic condensed phases include the superconducting phase exhibited by certain materials at low temperature, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on atomic lattices, and the Bose-Einstein condensate found in cold atomic systems. The study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using techniques of theoretical physics to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.The diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics: one third of all American physicists identify themselves as condensed matter physicists,[2] and The Division of Condensed Matter Physics (DCMP) is the largest division of the American Physical Society.[3] The field overlaps with chemistry, materials science, and nanotechnology, and relates closely to atomic physics and biophysics. Theoretical condensed matter physics shares important concepts and techniques with theoretical particle and nuclear physics.[4]A variety of topics in Physics such as crystallography, metallurgy, elasticity, magnetism, etc., were treated as distinct areas, until the 1940s when they were grouped together as Solid state physics. Around the 1960s, the study of physical properties of liquids were added to this list, and it came to be known as condensed matter physics.[5] According to physicist Phil Anderson, the term was coined by himself and Volker Heine when they changed the name of their group at the Cavendish Laboratories, Cambridge from "Solid state theory" to "Theory of Condensed Matter",[6] as they felt it did not exclude their interests in the study of liquids, nuclear matter and so on.[7] The Bell Labs (then known as the Bell Telephone Laboratories) was one of the first institutes to conduct a research program in condensed matter physics.[5]However, references to "condensed" state can be traced to earlier sources. In the introduction to his 1947 "Kinetic theory of liquids" book,[8] J Frenkel (see Yakov Frenkel) proposed that "The kinetic theory of liquids must accordingly be developed as a generalization and extension of the kinetic theory of solid bodies. As a matter of fact, it would be more correct to unify them under the title of "condensed bodies"".One of the first studies of condensed states of matter was by English chemist Humphry Davy, when he observed that of the forty chemical elements known at the time, twenty-six had metallic properties such as lustre, ductility and high electrical and thermal conductivity.[9] This indicated that the atoms in Dalton's atomic theory were not indivisible as Dalton claimed, but had inner structure. Davy further claimed that elements that were then believed to be gases, such as nitrogen and hydrogen could be liquified under the right conditions and would then behave as metals.[10][notes 1]In 1823, Michael Faraday, then an assistant in Davy's lab, successfully liquified chlorine and went on to liquify all known gaseous elements, with the exception of nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen.[9] Shortly after, in 1869, Irish chemist Thomas Andrews studied the phase transition from a liquid to a gas and coined the term critical point to describe the instant at which a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases,[12] and Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals supplied the theoretical framework which allowed the prediction of critical behavior based on measurements at much higher temperatures.[13] By 1908, James Dewar and H. Kamerlingh Onnes were successfully able to liquify hydrogen and then newly-discovered helium, respectively.[9]Paul Drude proposed the first theoretical model for a classical electron moving through a metallic solid.[4] Drude's model described properties of metals in terms of a gas of free electrons, and was the first microscopic model to explain empirical observations such as the WiedemannFranz law.[14][15] However, despite the success of Drude's free electron model, it had one notable problem, in that it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the specific heat of metals, as well as the temperature dependence of resistivity at low temperatures.[16]In 1911, just three years after helium was first liquified, Onnes working at University of Leiden discovered superconductivity in mercury, when he observed the electrical resistivity in mercury to vanish when the temperature was lowered below a certain value.[17] The phenomenon completely surprised the best theoretical physicists of the time, and it remained unexplained for several decades.[18] Albert Einstein, in 1922, said regarding contemporary theories of superconductivity that with our far-reaching ignorance of the quantum mechanics of composite systems we are very far from being able to compose a theory out of these vague ideas[19]Drude's classical model was augmented by Felix Bloch, Arnold Sommerfeld, and independently by Wolfgang Pauli, who used quantum mechanics to describe the motion of a quantum electron in a periodic lattice. In particular, Sommerfeld's theory accounted for the Fermi-Dirac statistics satisfied by electrons and was better able to explain the heat capacity and resistivity.[16] The structure of crystalline solids was studied by Max von Laue and Paul Knipping, when they observed the x-ray diffraction pattern of crystals, and concluded that crystals get their structure from periodic lattices of atoms.[20] The mathematics of crystal structures developed by Bravais, Federov and others was used to classify crystals by their symmetry group, and tables of crystal structures were the basis for the series International Tables of Crystallography, first published in 1935.[21] Band structure calculations was first used in 1930 to predict the properties of new materials, and in 1947 John Bardeen, Walter Brattain and William Shockley developed the first semiconductor-based transistor, heralding a revolution in electronics.[4]In 1879, Edwin Herbert Hall working at the Johns Hopkins University discovered the development of a voltage across conductors transverse to an electric current in the conductor and magnetic field perpendicular to the current.[22] This phenomenon arising due to the nature of charge carriers in the conductor came to be known as the Hall effect, but it was not properly explained at the time, since the electron was experimentally discovered 18 years later. After the advent of quantum mechanics, work done by Landau in 1930 predicted the quantization of the Hall conductance for electrons confined in two dimensions.[23]Magnetism as a property of matter has been known since pre-historic times.[24] However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started with the development of electrodynamics by Faraday, Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century, which included the classification of materials as ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and diamagnetic based on their response to magnetization.[25] Pierre Curie studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the Curie point phase transition in ferromagnetic materials.[24] In 1906, Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of ferromagnets.[26] The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising through the Ising model that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of quantum spins that collectively acquired magnetization.[24] The Ising model was solved exactly to show that spontaneous magnetization cannot occur in one dimension but is possible in higher dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Nel on antiferromagnetism led to the development of new magnetic materials with applications to magnetic storage devices.[24]The Sommerfeld model and spin models for ferromagnetism illustrated the successful application of quantum mechanics to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of superconductivity and the Kondo effect.[27] After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective modes of excitation of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist Lev Landau used the idea for the Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now known as Landau-quasiparticles.[27] Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases.[28] Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of superconductivity, based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair.[29]The study of phase transition and the critical behavior of observables, known as critical phenomena, was a major field of interest in the 1960s.[30] Kadanoff, Widom and Michael Fisher developed the ideas of critical exponents and scaling. These ideas were unified by Kenneth Wilson in 1972, under the formalism of the renormalization group in the context of quantum field theory.[30]The quantum Hall effect was discovered by Klaus von Klitzing in 1980 when he observed the Hall conductivity to be integer multiples of a fundamental constant.[31] (see figure) The effect was observed to be independent of parameters such as the system size and impurities, and in 1981, theorist Robert Laughlin proposed a theory describing the integer states in terms of a topological invariant called the Chern number.[32] Shortly after, in 1982, Strmer and Tsui observed the fractional quantum Hall effect where the conductivity was now a rational multiple of a constant. Laughlin, in 1983, realized that this was a consequence of quasiparticle interaction in the Hall states and formulated a variational solution, known as the Laughlin wavefunction.[33] The study of topological properties of the fractional Hall effect remains an active field of research.In 1987, Karl Mller and Johannes Bednorz discovered the first high temperature superconductor, a material which was superconducting at temperatures as high as 50 Kelvin. It was realized that the high temperature superconductors are examples of strongly correlated materials where the electron-electron interactions play an important role.[34] A satisfactory theoretical description of high-temperature superconductors is still not known and the field of strongly correlated materials continues to be an active research topic.Theoretical condensed matter physics involves the use of theoretical models to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the Drude model, the Band structure and the density functional theory. Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of phase transitions, such as the Landau-Ginzburg theory, Critical exponents and the use of mathematical techniques of quantum field theory and the renormalization group. Modern theoretical studies involve the use of numerical computation of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, topological phases and gauge symmetries.Theoretical understanding of condensed matter physics is closely related to the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents.[29] For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are not well understood, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known.[35] Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon.[36]The metallic state has historically been an important building block for studying properties of solids.[37] The first theoretical description of metals was given by Paul Drude in 1900 with the Drude model, which explained electrical and thermal properties by describing a metal as an ideal gas of then-newly discovered electrons. This classical model was then improved by Arnold Sommerfeld who incorporated the Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and was able to explain the anomalous behavior of the specific heat of metals in the WiedemannFranz law.[37] In 1913, X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that metals possess periodic lattice structure. Swiss physicist Felix Bloch provided a wave function solution to the Schrdinger equation with a periodic potential, called the Bloch wave.[38]Calculating electronic properties of metals by solving the many-body wavefunction is often computationally hard, and hence, approximation techniques are necessary to obtain meaningful predictions.[39] The Thomas-Fermi theory, developed in the 1920s, was used to estimate electronic energy levels by treating the local electron density as a variational parameter. Later in the 1930s, Douglas Hartree, Vladimir Fock and John Slater developed the so-called Hartree-Fock wavefunction as an improvement over the Thomas-Fermi model. The Hartree-Fock method accounted for exchange statistics of single particle electron wavefunctions, but not for their Coulomb interaction. Finally in 196465, Walter Kohn, Pierre Hohenberg and Lu Jeu Sham proposed the density functional theory which gave realistic descriptions for bulk and surface properties of metals. The density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used since the 1970s for band structure calculations of variety of solids.[39]Certain states of matter exhibit symmetry breaking, where the relevant laws of physics possess some symmetry that is broken. A common example is crystalline solids, which break continuous translational symmetry. Other examples include magnetized ferromagnets, which break rotational symmetry, and more exotic states such as the ground state of a BCS superconductor, that breaks U(1) rotational symmetry.[40]Goldstone's theorem in quantum field theory states that in a system with broken continuous symmetry, there may exist excitations with arbitrarily low energy, called the Goldstone bosons. For example, in crystalline solids, these correspond to phonons, which are quantized versions of lattice vibrations.[41]The study of critical phenomena and phase transitions is an important part of modern condensed matter physics.[42] Phase transition refers to the change of phase of a system, which are brought about by change in an external parameter such as temperature. In particular, quantum phase transitions refer to transitions where the temperature is set to zero, and the phases of the system refer to distinct ground states of the Hamiltonian. Systems undergoing phase transition display critical behavior, wherein several of their properties such as correlation length, specific heat and susceptibility diverge. Continuous phase transitions are described by the Ginzburg-Landau theory, which works in the so-called mean field approximation. However, several important phase transitions, such as the Mott insulator-superfluid transition, are known that do not follow the Ginzburg-Landau paradigm.[43] The study of phase transitions in strongly-correlated systems is an active area of research.[44]Experimental condensed matter physics involves the use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials. Experimental probes include effects of electric and magnetic fields, measurement of response functions, transport properties and thermometry.[8] Commonly used experimental techniques include spectroscopy, with probes such as X-rays, infrared light and inelastic neutron scattering; study of thermal response, such as specific heat and measurement of transport via thermal and heat conduction.Several condensed matter experiments involve scattering of an experimental probe, such as X-ray and optical photons, neutrons etc., off constituents of a material. The choice of scattering probe depends on the observation energy scale of interest.[45] Visible light has energy on the scale of 1 eV and is used as a scattering probe to measure variations in material properties such as dielectric constant and refractive index. X-rays have energies of the order of 10 keV and hence are able to probe atomic length scales, and are used to measure variations in electron charge density. Neutrons can also probe atomic length scales and are used to study scattering off nuclei and electron spins and magnetization (as neutrons themselves have spin but no charge).[45] Coulomb and Mott scattering measurements can be made by using electron beams as scattering probes,[46] and similarly, positron annihilation can be used as an indirect measurement of local electron density.[47] Laser spectroscopy is used as a tool for studying phenomena with energy in the range of visible light, for example, to study non-linear optics and forbidden transitions in media.[48]In experimental condensed matter physics, external magnetic fields act as thermodynamic variables that control the state, phase transitions and properties of material systems.[49] Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a technique by which external magnetic fields can be used to find resonance modes of individual electrons, thus giving information about the atomic, molecular and bond structure of their neighborhood. NMR experiments can be made in magnetic fields with strengths up to 65 Tesla.[50] Quantum oscillations is another experimental technique where high magnetic fields are used to study material properties such as the geometry of the fermi surface.[51] The quantum hall effect is another example of measurements with high magnetic fields where topological properties such as Chern-Simons angle can be measured experimentally.[48]Cold ion trapping in optical lattices is an experimental tool commonly used in condensed matter as well as atomic, molecular, and optical physics.[52] The technique involves using optical lasers to create an interference pattern, which acts as a "lattice", in which ions or atoms can be placed at very low temperatures.[53] Cold atoms in optical lattices are used as "quantum simulators", that is, they act as controllable systems that can model behavior of more complicated systems, such as frustrated magnets.[54] In particular, they are used to engineer one, two and three dimensional lattices for a Hubbard model with pre-specified parameters.[55] and to study phase transitions for Nel and spin liquid ordering.[52]In 1995, a gas of rubidium atoms cooled down to a temperature of 170 nK was used to experimentally realize the Bose-Einstein condensate, a novel state of matter originally predicted by S. N. Bose and Albert Einstein, wherein a large number of atoms occupy a single quantum state.[56]Research in condensed matter physics has given rise to several device applications, such as the development of the semiconductor transistor,[4] and laser technology.[48] Several phenomena studied in the context of nanotechnology come under the purview of condensed matter physics.[57] Techniques such as scanning-tunneling microscopy can be used control processes at the nanometre scale, and have given rise to the study of nano-fabrication.[58] Several condensed matter systems are being studied with potential applications to quantum computation,[59] including experimental systems like quantum dots, SQUIDs, and theoretical models like the toric code and the quantum dimer model.[60] Condensed matter systems can be tuned to provide the conditions of coherence and phase-sensitivity that are essential ingredients for quantum information storage.[58] Spintronics is a new area of technology that can be used for information processing and transmission, and is based on spin, rather than electron transport.[58] Condensed matter physics also has important applications to Biophysics, for example, the experimental technique of magnetic resonance imaging, which is widely used in medical diagnosis.[58]vte1 History

The Mentalist is an American police procedural television series that debuted on September 23, 2008, on CBS.[1] The show was created by Bruno Heller, who is also its executive producer. The show follows former "psychic" Patrick Jane (Simon Baker), who is now a consultant to the fictional California Bureau of Investigation (CBI), using the highly developed observational skills he previously employed to "read" peoples' minds. The Mentalist was released on iTunes on October 1, 2012.[citation needed]On March 14, 2012, CBS announced that The Mentalist had been renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on September 30, 2012.[2]The Mentalist follows Patrick Jane, an independent consultant for the fictional California Bureau of Investigation (CBI) based in Sacramento, California. Although not an officer of the law of any sort, he uses skills from his former career as a successful, yet knowingly and admittedly fraudulent psychic medium to help a team of CBI agents solve various crimes. The ultimate goal of Patrick Jane and his cooperation with the CBI is to track down the killer known as "Red John" who was responsible for the brutal murders of Patrick's wife and daughter.Patrick Jane formerly had a lucrative career as a con man, successfully posing as a psychic medium and enjoying near-celebrity status. He appeared on television to claim that his paranormal abilities helped the police profile a serial killer named Red John. Red John, angered by the perceived slight, murdered Jane's wife and young daughter in revenge. Jane subsequently abandoned his job as a psychic and teamed with the CBI, using his skills to help them solve various crimes. His main focus is on the cases involving Red John or Red John copycats. He admits to faking the supernatural aspects of his skills, often asserting that "there's no such thing as psychics," yet he has finely honed skills in cold reading, hypnotism, and pickpocketing, as well as powerful observational skill and a deep insight into the human psyche and behavior. These skills come in handy in every episode, but his unorthodox and bizarre techniques to solve crimes sometimes offend the team of agents with whom he works.The show often sets episodes in fictional locales with names like Salinger Mill and Rancho Rosa. Like the majority of American television shows, The Mentalist is mostly filmed within the studio zone in Los Angeles County, but occasionally films a few scenes on location in Sacramento.On October 15, 2008, CBS ordered a full (the first) season of The Mentalist.[3] On May 20, 2009, CBS renewed The Mentalist for a second season, which premiered on September 24, 2009, in the US[4] and on September 22 on CTV in Canada,[5] as well as September 28, 2009, in Australia. On May 19, 2010, CBS announced that The Mentalist was renewed for a third season.[6] On May 18, 2011, the show was officially renewed for a fourth season, and on March 14, 2012, CBS renewed the show for a fifth season.Warner Home Video has released the first three seasons on DVD in Regions 1, 2, and 4. Season 4 will be released on September 18, 2012[7] in Region 1, October 8, 2012[8] in Region 2 and on October 31, 2012 in Region 4.[9]The pilot episode had an audience of 15.6 million viewers in its first airing, and 7.8 million in a re-airing three days later.[18] The December 2, 2008, episode ("Flame Red") was the highest-rated television show of the week, marking the first time a program in its first season had achieved that distinction since Desperate Housewives four years earlier.[19]The show has been criticized as being a rip-off of Psych.[20][21]On November 6, 2009, TNT announced that it had obtained exclusive syndication rights for The Mentalist and would begin airing old episodes of the series starting in the fall of 2011.[31] In Greece, the series premiered in 2009 on pay-TV service NovaCinema 1, the first season premiered in February 7, 2011 on Star Channel, and so far season 2 has been broadcast. In India, The Mentalist premiered on November 2010 on Zee Cafe and was re-aired from May 14, 2012 (Season 1 to Season 4).The Mentalist at TV.com1 Synopsis2 Production3 Cast and characters

His backstory is that he spent his childhood in traveling carnivals with his mean-spirited con-man father who taught him to see all outsiders as marks. He met his wife, Angela, who was also a carny, and together they left the carnival life. Honing the skills his father taught him, Jane became a successful psychic and medium. Red John murdered Angela and their daughter Charlotte in retaliation for Jane's televised challenge. Jane now works as a criminal consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation. Jane has started to develop close friendships with his colleagues, especially his boss, Senior Special Agent Teresa Lisbon. He usually presents his jocular, teasing face, but he shows his darker side when dealing with Red John. At those times, Jane becomes intense, focused, and willing to go to great lengths to capture and even kill him. He owns a classic French car, a robin egg blue Citron DS. As an avid tea drinker, he shows a certain liking to lapsang souchong at multiple occasions.Robin Tunney as Senior Special Agent Teresa Lisbona senior special agent with the CBI and leader of the Serious Crime Unit of which Patrick is part. Though Patrick often annoys her with his unusual behavior and going behind her back, she views him as a valuable member of the team and will almost always back him up. Her mother was killed in a drunk driving accident, leaving her to care for her brothers and her abusive alcoholic father. She is the only member of the team Patrick trusts with details of his past and they work well together, though his attitude often causes trouble for her. Her team is responsible for the Red John case, although the responsibility for catching Red John was taken over briefly by Sam Bosco, her mentor when she was a junior agent, until he and his team were murdered by one of Red John's operatives. Although there has never been a demonstrated romantic link between Jane and Lisbon in any episode, the writers have not eliminated it as a plausible possible development for future episodes. At the very least she is one of the few people that Jane truly cares about, and she is seen from time to time affected by his charm.Tim Kang as Special Agent Kimball Choa special agent with the CBI and a member of Lisbon's Serious Crime Unit. Cho has a dry, deadpan sense of humor and is good friends with Rigsby. He is often the one who sees through Patrick's parlor tricks (when Patrick tells Van Pelt that he was moving a straw across the table with telekinesis, Cho simply says, "He blew on it"). He was secretly called Ernie by the Bosco team, who also refer to Rigsby as Bert; Cho claims not to mind, as "Ernie's the clever, handsome one." He was a member of a street gang, the Avon Park Playboys, garnering a juvenile record, which is sealed. He also spent time in juvenile hall, until leaving to serve in the U.S. Army Special Forces, before becoming a police officer and then joining the CBI. Because of his difficult childhood, Cho often befriends kids who have committed crimes, possibly because they remind him of himself at that age.Owain Yeoman as Special Agent Wayne Rigsbya special agent with the CBI and a member of Lisbon's Serious Crime Unit, serving as an arson specialist. He served two years as a San Diego arson investigator before joining CBI. He developed strong feelings for Van Pelt. He didn't initially act on them, as romance between agents is against regulations, but ultimately the two gave in to their feelings and began seeing each other secretly. Their relationship ultimately became public knowledge, and so an ultimatum was issued to them by Madeleine Hightower to end their relationship, which they did to protect both of their careers. They remain friends and colleagues, despite the awkwardness of the working environment. Rigsby's father is a former career criminal who used to be part of a notorious biker gang. To save his father from going back to jail for parole violations, Rigsby lies to his father's parole officer. This forces Cho to lie to SPU during an investigation into the murder of cop killer Todd Johnson while in CBI custody.Amanda Righetti as Special Agent Grace Van Pelta special agent with the CBI and a member of Lisbon's Serious Crime Unit, serving as its newest member, often doing research for other members. She has a deep belief in religion and psychics and will butt heads with Patrick when he dismisses it or does something morally inappropriate. Van Pelt became secretly involved with Rigsby after months of reluctance owing to the regulations prohibiting romantic relationships between agents (although Jane has always known about it, thanks to his superpowersin fact, he even encouraged Rigsby and Van Pelt to act on their desires before they proceeded to second base). She is subdued and very organized, which leads Jane to deduce during the first season that this is because she is hiding some deep emotional trauma. She was engaged to FBI Agent Craig O'Laughlin, whom she killed after he revealed himself as one of Red John's accomplices.Red Johna nickname for the show's leading antagonist. He is a serial killer thought to have murdered at least 28 people, including Patrick Jane's wife and daughter, five years before the pilot episode. Red John often taunts Jane, and saved Jane's life when he was about to be killed by Red John copycats; he parted from Jane on that occasion by quoting the opening stanza of "The Tyger" by William Blake. His crimes and "associates" are portrayed in every season of the series, although the character has been seen fully on screen only once, disguised for complete anonymity.[citation needed] Locating and killing Red John is Jane's primary motivation for assisting the CBI.Gregory Itzin as Supervising Agent Virgil Minellithe former special agent in charge of the CBI until the Season 2 episode "His Red Right Hand." Minelli was an effective team leader, yet appeared fatigued and exhausted from years of political battles with his subordinates and his superiors. Nevertheless, he behaved in a paternal and friendly way to Lisbon's team. Minelli is finally pushed to his breaking point following the murders of Sam Bosco and his team by Rebecca, their secretary and a member of Red John's network; these were the first agents ever to die under his command. As a result, Minelli retired to a quiet life as a fisherman and was replaced by Madeleine Hightower. In the Season 3 episode "Jolly Red Elf," Minelli is approached by Patrick for support in Patrick's investigation into Red John's network, and Minelli ultimately agrees to help him.Aunjanue Ellis as Supervising Agent Madeleine Hightowerthe former special agent in charge of the CBI. In the Season 2 episode "The Red Box," Hightower arrives to take command, replacing Virgil Minelli. She is very much in command of the team and is one of the few people to have a hold on Patrick Jane. Despite adopting a hard-nosed by-the-book approach to managing the CBI, and her own skill as an administrator, she maintains an efficient and friendly relationship with the team. She also respects and sees Jane as valuable to the CBI and its future, and seems to understand Patrick's focus on finding Red John. Hightower is in the middle of a divorce and has two children. In Season 3, Hightower is among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and is considered a prime suspect owing to her previous relationship with one of Johnson's victims; this, along with evidence planted at the scene of the murder of Johnson's accomplice, Manuel Montero, ultimately leaves Hightower a wanted fugitive. Jane realizes Hightower was framed by Red John's accomplice, the true killer, and helps her escape; he then works throughout Season 3 to identify the true CBI mole. In the Season 3 finale, Hightower resurfaces, realizing Red John is closing in, and works with Jane and the team to expose the moleFBI agent Craig O'Laughlin; who is shot and killed by Hightower and Van Pelt in a showdown at Hightower's hideout.Pruitt Taylor Vince as Special Agent/Supervising Agent J.J. LaRochethe head of CBI's Internal Affairs. He arrives in the Season 3 episode "Jolly Red Elf," appointed the new head of the CBI's Professional Standards Unit. Following the demise of a member of Red John's network, Todd Johnson, while in custody at the CBI, LaRoche had been brought in to question the team after Johnson's death appeared to be an inside job. He is quirky, charmless, professional, socially awkward and Patrick's intellectual equal. But despite his "Robo-Cop" act, he has been shown to be a relatively normal person when not directly engaged in his job, dropping the veneer when he is around Jane. LaRoche initially considered Jane his prime suspect, but ultimately named Agent Hightower as the killer owing to evidence planted by Red John's mole, who was the true killer. With Hightower a fugitive, LaRoche was appointed to take over Hightower's duties as the team's supervisor and Jane's boss. LaRoche quickly asserted his command when he briefly removed Lisbon and replaced her with Cho, promoting him to team leader, but later reappointed Lisbon as team leader (after commending Cho's stint as acting leader, in Cho's file) and makes it very clear that he had removed Lisbon to show he would not tolerate any disrespect. In the Season 3 finale, Jane blackmailed LaRoche into handing over the suspect list by threatening to reveal LaRoche's dark secret; Jane later admits he has absolutely no idea what LaRoche's dark secret is, "but it must be horrible." In Season 4, LaRoche revealed to Lisbon that he is leaving his temporary assignment with the CBI Major Crimes Unit and is returning to Professional Services. LaRoche states his time working with Lisbon and Jane has been "interesting" and then awkwardly hugs Lisbon, who wishes him luck. LaRoche returns in season 5's "Blood Feud" to investigate Rigsby shooting a gang leader who had caused the death of Rigsby's father. LaRoche decides that officially Rigsby acted as part of his job but makes it clear he believes Jane manipulated events so Rigsby could take revenge for his father.Michael Rady as Supervising Agent Luther WainwrightIn the season 4 episode "Ring Around the Rosie," Wainwright takes command of Lisbon's team. He is shown to be quite young and intelligent, but also arrogant. Later episodes show Wainwright being mellow and generally not taking a very active role in Lisbon's cases, other than giving the team deadlines or incentives for the high-profile ones. In the Season 4 finale, "The Crimson Hat," Wainwright is the tragic victim of one of Red John's most dastardly plots to date. Red John lures Jane out to an empty lot. Jane is followed by the CBI team, and they are unknowingly followed by the FBI. When the car supposedly containing Red John tries to escape, FBI agents shoot and kill both the driver and the backseat passenger (thought to be Red John). When they open the door to remove him, they find they have actually shot Wainwright, tied up and gagged, with a speaker around his neck to transmit Red John's voice.Michael Gaston as director of CBI Gale Bertram; the bureau director of the entire California Bureau of Investigation, first appointed in the Season 3 premiere "Red Sky at Night." Bertram appears to be mostly concerned with politics and the media, but has been shown to be well aware of Lisbon's team and her effectiveness at closing cases and has a high regard for Jane's productiveness and worth as a CBI asset. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed that Bertram was among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed Bertram was the killer, FBI agent Craig O'Laughlin was revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer. In Season 4, Bertram suspends Lisbon and her team in retaliation. Throughout his appearances, there have been minor indications that he is connected to Red John, most notably when, in the Season 3 episode "Red Queen," he refers to a poem of William Blake, a poet whom Red John had also referenced personally to Patrick Jane, and again in the Season 4 premiere, Bertram secretly directs District Attorney Ardiles to lead the prosecution against Jane at his murder trial, after suspending Lisbon and her team.Catherine Dent as Susan Darcy, an FBI agent assigned to the Panzer case in season 4 episode "Blinking Red Light." In "Always Bet on Red" she quickly becomes suspicious of Jane's claim that Red John is dead. He is in fact alive, something Jane doesn't want Darcy to find out, as Red John would kill her for having such knowledge. In the episode "Cheap Burgundy," Darcy asked Jane to assist her with a case she was investigating, but during the investigation she kept trying to confirm that Red John was alive, but Jane kept denying it. During one such conversation, it was confirmed that Susan lost a sister to drowning and that she blamed herself for what happened. At the end of the episode, Jane reluctantly admitted that Red John was alive. Darcy accused Jane of being one of Red John's friends and disciples, and finally tells Wainwright she is going to "bring (Jane) down."Rebecca Wisocky as Brenda Shettrick, the head of the CBI's Media Relations Unitshe is entirely concerned with liaising with the media and leading outreach programs and other efforts to the public; she appears to have good relations with the team and senior agents. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed that Shettrick was among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed that CBI director Gale Bertram was the killer, FBI agent Craig O'Laughlin was ultimately revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer.David Norona as Osvaldo Ardiles, an assistant district attorney who quickly proves to be an enemy of the team when he tries to convict an innocent man of armed robbery in an effort to get information on a powerful Mafia group. Cho, realizing Ardiles' plan would never work, and that Ardiles himself was not going to listen to Cho, proved the man's innocence. Ardiles, furious, retaliated by cutting off all support from the D.A.'s office to the team. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed that Ardiles was among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed that CBI director Gale Bertram was the killer, FBI agent Craig O'Laughlin was ultimately revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer. In the Season 4 premiere, Ardiles, at Bertram's direction, tries to charge Jane with killing Timothy Carter, but in the end Jane was cleared of all charges, and Ardiles lost the case.Leslie Hope as Kristina Fryean alleged psychic who has occasionally worked with the CBI. When they first met, she and Patrick were at odds. Patrick believes she is a fake, owing to his own awareness that psychics do not exist. Later, he becomes emotional after Frye states to Patrick that she has spoken with his dead wife about their daughter's final moments. As time goes by, Kristina helps out with more murder cases, and romantic sparks start to fly between her and Patrick. In the Season 2 finale, Kristina is put under protection by the CBI when she attempts to reach out to Red John, andas Patrick had fearedKristina later disappears from her heavily guarded home. In the Season 3 episode "Blood on His Hands," Kristina is found alive but unresponsive, after four months of being missing, through a tipoff from Visualize leader Brett Stiles. After Jane attempts to communicate with her in a sance, she tells him that she is dead, which Jane denies. She appears to be at peace, wryly teasing Jane. She is unaware of the circumstances of her disappearance and cannot or will not provide any information of value to Jane. She is, to date, catatonic and presumably institutionalized.Terry Kinney as Sam Boscoa senior special agent with the CBI and another team leader. He was Lisbon's mentor when she was a junior agent, and despite being married, he shared strong romantic feelings for her until he died. When Bosco became an investigative team leader in the new Serial Crimes Unit, Virgil Minelli gave Bosco the responsibility for catching Red John. He was Patrick Jane's office nemesisbased on a lack of trust, they had an antagonistic relationship. Patrick didn't trust Bosco to properly investigate the Red John case, and Bosco viewed Jane as untrustworthy and unreliable. In the Season 2 episode "His Red Right Hand," Bosco's team was murdered by Rebecca, their secretary and a member of Red John's network. Rebecca confirms to Jane that Red John ordered the murders because he knows that Jane wants the case. Only Bosco lived long enough to arrive alive, but in critical condition, at the hospital. Shortly before he died Bosco made peace with Patrick, who confirmed to Bosco that he would kill Red John.Eric Winter as FBI agent Craig O'Laughlina special agent in charge who first meets (through a car crash) the CBI team while jointly investigating Visualize. O'Laughlin catches the attention of Van Pelt, and the two of them have instant chemistry. Over time, their romance deepens; in the episode "Blood for Blood," O'Laughlin asks her to marry him and she agrees, much to Rigsby's displeasure. He is shown to have seniority, technical expertise, high intelligence and combat skill. His past before joining the FBI includes his being a National Football League player who knew (and fondly remembers) Van Pelt's father, and a learned traveler of the Far East. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed O'Laughlin is among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed CBI director Gale Bertram was the killer, O'Laughlin was revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer. In a showdown at Hightower's hideout, O'Laughlin shot and wounded Lisbon and made it clear he was Red John's accomplice. A wounded Lisbon musters enough strength to throw and hit O'Laughlin with a sofa pillow. While O'Laughlin is distracted for the split second by getting hit with the sofa pillow, Van Pelt and Hightower draw their firearms and shoot O'Laughlin, fatally wounding him.Bradley Whitford as Fake Red John/Timothy Cartera child abductor and one of Red John's accomplices. He kidnapped a young girl named Debbi Lupin and kept her locked up in his basement with his wife as an accomplice. In the Season 3 final episode "Strawberries and Cream," after Craig O'Laughlin is killed while trying to kill Hightower in her mountain cabin hideout, Jane (who is in a food court in a Sacramento mall) has Lisbon use the redial on O'Laughlin's phone and tell whoever answers that O'Laughlin is dead. Timothy is sitting in the food court near Jane and answers his phone. Jane, seeing this, has Lisbon tell him what the person she called said to her. It is the same thing that Timothy in the food court said, so Jane confronts him. Timothy first denies it, but moments later drops hints that he is Red John, keeping Jane at a safe distance by subtly pointing a revolver hidden inside a folded newspaper at him. Jane, however, is still skeptical, and confronts the man again as he tries to leave, only for him to reveal to Jane details of the murders of his wife and daughter, specifically, what they smelled like. This sends Jane over the edge; he calls after the man and then guns him down with a weapon hidden in his coat pocket. Jane then sits down and calmly sips tea while waiting to be arrested, apparently satisfied that this man was indeed Red John. In the Season 4 premiere, it is revealed that Timothy Carter is not really Red John after all, after Jane tricks Carter's wife into revealing that they had kidnapped Debbi. In the Season 4 episode "Little Red Book," Patrick takes Rosalind Harker, Red John's blind ex-girlfriend, to the morgue where Carter's body is stored, and has her feel its face to check if she recognizes him. After doing so, Rosalind confirms Patrick's suspicionsCarter was not the man who identified himself as "Roy Tagliaferro" (one of Red John's aliases).Jillian Bach as Sarah Harrigana public defender whom the team first meet in the Season 3 episode "Every Rose Has Its Thorn," where she is a client at a matchmaking service. Her interest is piqued by Rigsby during an interview regarding an alibi she provides to a suspect, after which she asks him out on a date, which he accepts. She and Rigsby continue their relationship during season 4, where she is assigned as the legal counsel for a suspect the team are interviewing in one episode. During another episode, she assists Rigsby with his upcoming testimony for a case that has gone to trial, before they consummate their relationship. She announces in "My Bloody Valentine" that she is pregnant. In "Black Cherry" it is revealed that Sarah is now an ADA with DA's office.Samaire Armstrong as Summer Edgecombe a prostitute recruited by Cho as a confidential informant in Season 4. In "At First Blush," Cho admits to having feelings for Summer, and a romance develops. She and Cho part ways in episode "So Long, and Thanks for All the Red Snapper."Emmanuelle Chriqui as Lorelei Martinsa cocktail waitress and Red John follower whom he sends to meet and seduce Patrick Jane in "The Crimson Hat." She becomes Jane's lover and eventually is captured alive by the CBI at the end of Season 4.David Warshofsky as Donald "Donny" Culpepper a professional thief that the CBI first comes across in the Season 2 episode "A Price Above Rubies," where he is a suspect in a case involving a thief who critically wounds the husband of a wealthy jewelry store owner. He is proven innocent but does not appreciate Jane's insults and threatens physical harm or worse if they meet again. They apparently reconcile by the Season 3 episode "Redacted," as Jane hires him to steal Agent LaRoche's Todd Johnson murder suspect list from LaRoche's home. Culpepper fails to find it and gets caught. He tells Jane that if Jane does not get the charges dropped, Culpepper will tell CBI what he was doing. Lisbon gets the charges dropped by punching Culpepper in the face. In the Season 3 finale, Jane admits to having hired Culpepper, telling this directly to LaRoche, but avoids punishment by threatening to reveal LaRoche's dark secret, which Jane claims Culpepper discovered while searching through LaRoche's safe, then revealed to Jane while in custody. Jane later admits that Culpepper learned nothing about LaRoche's secret.Alicia Witt as Rosalind Harkera blind woman, Rosalind had a relationship with Red John, who called himself by the alias Roy Tagliaferro. According to her, his car broke down near her home and she wound up spending the next few months in a relationship with him. He left her without saying goodbye, though he did draw one of his smiley faces on a wall in her house. In the Season 1 finale episode "Red John's Footsteps," Patrick and Lisbon find her and get a description of Red John. In the end of Season 4 episode "Little Red Book," Patrick contacts Rosalind and brings her to a morgue where the body of Timothy Carter, one of Red John's accomplices who had manipulated Patrick into killing him by pretending to be Red John himself, was kept. He has her feel Carter's face to see if she can identify him. She tells him that she has never meet the man before, confirming Patrick's suspicions that Red John is still alive.Currie Graham as Walter Mashburna highly successful billionaire businessman. He first appears in the Season 2 episode "Redline" as a murder suspect, but is cleared by Patrick, for whom he has quickly grown respect. This respect deepens in the Season 3 episode "Red Hot," where Mashburn is saved from assassination attempts, and along the way develops a (brief) romance with Lisbon.Jack Plotnick as Brett Partridgea CBI forensic specialist who has appeared in two episodes. He is very minor and is not named on screen. Jane states Brett "loves his job a bit too much" and calls him a ghoul.David Paymer as James Panzera serial killer known as the San Joaquin Killer who appeared in the Season 4 episode "Blinking Red Light." James Panzer pretended to be a blogger devoting his life to find a serial killer known as the San Joaquin Killer (SJK). SJK killed at least five young women, ranging in age from 16 to 20, two of which murders were seen in the episode. In actuality, however, Panzer was the San Joaquin Killer himself. Patrick Jane suspected Panzer of being SJK. Jane's suspicions were borne out when he and Panzer both appeared on Karen Cross's television show discussing the SJK case. During the show, Jane goaded Panzer into comparing Red John unfavorably with SJK. Panzer rose to the bait, saying that the SJK killings were the work of a genius and Red John by comparison was a "common sociopath, lazy, sloppy, delusional," and becoming so absorbed in building up SJK's image that he was unaware that he was making the same mistake that Patrick Jane and Kristina Frye had made: namely, belittling Red John in a public forum. Shortly after the television appearance, Panzer was found murdered in an alleyway, with Red John's smiley face painted in blood on the wall near his body. Panzer's murder proved Jane's theory that Red John is still alive.Shauna Bloom as Rebeccaan assistant on Sam Bosco's team at CBI, and one of Red John's accomplices. Rebecca's past has not been fully revealed, but some details are known. According to Patrick Jane, she had an unhappy childhood and was molested by a close relative. The molestation led to her developing a strong sense of self-loathing, which manifested itself as self-abuse and self-medication. In the Season 2 episode "His Red Right Hand," Rebecca killed Bosco and two other agentsunder orders from Red Johnso that Lisbon's team, and Patrick, would be given the case back. Also under Red John's orders, and using the alias Agent Rojo (Spanish for "red"), she stole a body and evidence that could have brought Lisbon's team closer to identifying Red John. Rebecca was killed (by poison), very likely by Red John himself (disguised as a guard), in CBI.Malcolm McDowell as Bret Stilesthe leader of the Visualize Self-Realization Center church. Stiles is an ambiguous church leader who is charismatic, smooth, and skilled. He has succeeded in deflecting investigations from the authorities on numerous occasions and has hinted to Patrick that he has inside knowledge about Red John. On their last meeting, Bret provided information that led to Jane and the CBI recovering Kristina Frye alive (but catatonic). Soon afterward, Bret left to open a Visualize center in Jakarta, with his representatives claiming not to know when he might return. Stiles does return in the fourth season episode "His Thoughts Were Red Thoughts," and is charged with murdering an anticult activist. However, Jane helps prove Stiles's innocence, leading Stiles to say that he owes Jane a favor.eljko Ivanek as Dr. Linus Wagnera partner of the victim in "Pilot" episode, where double homicide which looks as though it may have been committed by the serial killer Red John. At the end of the episode it is revealed that Dr. Wagner himself is a copycat of Red John, and is the true killer.On January 7, 2009, the show won the award for "Favorite New TV Drama" at the 35th People's Choice Awards.[22]Simon Baker received a nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the 2009 Emmy Awards.[23]The series has been nominated for The International TV Dagger at the 2009 Crime Thriller Awards, an awards ceremony presented by the British Crime Writers' Association.[24]Simon Baker received a nomination for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor  Television Series Drama at the 67th Golden Globe Awards.Simon Baker received a nomination for Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards.[25]On August 21, 2010, The Mentalist was honored with an award for its scientific and critical thinking content, from The IIG during its 10th Anniversary Gala.

Golf is a precision club and ball sport, in which competing players (or golfers) use many types of clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a golf course using the fewest number of strokes. Golf is defined, in the rules of golf, as "playing a ball with a club from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the Rules."It is one of the few ball games that does not require a standardized playing area. Instead, the game is played on a "course", generally consisting of an arranged progression of either 9 or 18 "holes". Each hole on the course must contain a "tee box" and a "putting green" with the actual hole, and there are various other standardized forms of terrain in between such as the fairway, rough, and hazards, but each hole on a course and indeed among virtually all courses is unique in its specific layout and arrangement.Golf competition is generally played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known simply as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes during a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at virtually all levels of play, although variations of match play such as "skins" games are also seen in televised events.While the modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland, the game's ancient origins are unclear and much debated. Some historians[3] trace the sport back to the Roman game of paganica, in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball. One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as the Romans conquered most of the continent, during the first century BC, and eventually evolved into the modern game.[4] Others cite chuiwan ("chui" means striking and "wan" means small ball) as the progenitor, a Chinese game played between the eighth and 14th centuries.[5] A Ming Dynasty scroll dating back to 1368 entitled "The Autumn Banquet" shows a member of the Chinese Imperial court swinging what appears to be a golf club at a small ball with the aim of sinking it into a hole. The game is thought to have been introduced into Europe during the Middle Ages. Another early game that resembled modern golf was known as cambuca in England and chambot in France.[6] This game was, in turn, exported to the Low Countries, Germany, and England (where it was called pall-mall, pronounced pell mell).[citation needed] Some observers,[who?] however, believe that golf descended from the Persian game, chaugn. In addition, kolven (a game involving a ball and curved bats) was played annually in Loenen, Netherlands, beginning in 1297, to commemorate the capture of the assassin of Floris V, a year earlier.The modern game originated in Scotland, where the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery.[7] To many golfers, the Old Course at St Andrews, a links course dating to before 1574, is considered to be a site of pilgrimage.[8] Golf is documented as being played on Musselburgh Links, East Lothian, Scotland as early as 2 March 1672, which is certified as the oldest golf course in the world by Guinness World Records.[9][10] The oldest surviving rules of golf were compiled in March 1744 for the Company of Gentlemen Golfers, later renamed The Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, which was played at Leith, Scotland.[11] The world's oldest golf tournament in existence, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, which was first played on 17 October 1860 at Prestwick Golf Club, in Ayrshire, Scotland.[12]A golf course consists of a series of holes, each with a teeing ground that is set off by two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area, fairway, rough and other hazards, and the putting green surrounded by the fringe with the pin (normally a flagstick) and cup.The levels of grass are varied to increase difficulty, or to allow for putting in the case of the green. While many holes are designed with a direct line-of-sight from the teeing area to the green, some holes may bend either to the left or to the right. This is commonly called a "dogleg", in reference to a dog's knee. The hole is called a "dogleg left" if the hole angles leftwards and "dogleg right" if it bends right. Sometimes, a hole's direction may bend twice; this is called a "double dogleg".A typical golf course consists of 18 holes, but nine-hole courses are common and can be played twice through for a full round of 18 holes.[13][14]Early Scottish golf courses were primarily laid out on links land, soil-covered sand dunes directly inland from beaches.[15] This gave rise to the term "golf links", particularly applied to seaside courses and those built on naturally sandy soil inland.The first 18-hole golf course in the United States was located on a sheep farm in Downers Grove, Illinois, in 1892. The course is still situated there today.[16]Every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. A 'round' typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout. On a standard course of 18 holes, each hole is played once in the round; on a nine-hole course, players may play a "short game" playing each hole once, or a "full round" by playing each hole twice.Playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground (also called the tee box, or simply the tee). For this first shot on each hole, it is allowed but not required for the golfer to place the ball on a tee prior to striking it. A tee in this last sense is a small peg which can be used to elevate the ball slightly above the ground up to a few centimetres high, which reduces the interference of the ground or grass on the movement of the club making the ball easier to hit, and also places the ball in the very center of the striking face of the club (the "sweet spot") for better distance. Tees are commonly made of wood but may be constructed of any material, including plastic. Traditionally, golfers used mounds of sand to elevate the ball, and containers of sand were provided for the purpose. A few courses still require sand to be used instead of peg tees, to reduce litter and reduce damage to the teeing ground.When the initial shot on a hole is intended to move the ball a long distance (typically more than 225 yards), the shot is commonly called a 'drive' and is generally made with a long-shafted, large-headed wood club called a 'driver'. Shorter holes may be initiated with other clubs, such as higher-numbered woods or irons. Once the ball comes to rest, the golfer strikes it again as many times as necessary using shots that are variously known as a 'lay-up', an 'approach', a 'pitch', or a 'chip', until the ball reaches the green, where he or she then 'putts' the ball into the hole (commonly called "sinking the putt" or "holing out"). The goal of getting the ball into the hole ("holing" the ball) in as few strokes as possible may be impeded by obstacles such as areas of longer grass called 'rough' (usually found alongside fairways) which both slows any ball that contacts it and makes it harder to advance a ball that has stopped on it; 'doglegs', which are changes in the direction of the fairway that often require shorter shots to play around them; bunkers (or sand traps); and water hazards such as ponds or streams.[13]In stroke play competitions played according to strict rules, each player plays his or her ball until it is holed no matter how many strokes that may take, but in match play it is acceptable to simply pick up one's ball and "surrender the hole" after enough strokes have been made by a player that it is mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole. It is also acceptable in informal stroke play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the "par" rating of the hole (a "triple bogey" - see below); while technically a violation of Rule 3-2, this practice speeds play as a courtesy to others, and avoids "runaway scores", excessive frustration and injuries caused by overexertion.Players can walk to their next shot or drive in golf carts over the course or along pathways beside it. The game can be played either individually or in groups and sometimes accompanied by caddies, who carry and manage the players' equipment and who are allowed by the rules to give advice on the play of the course.[17] A caddy's advice can only be given to the player or players for whom the caddy is working, and not to competing players.The rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by The R&A, spun off in 2004 from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews (founded 1754), and the United States Golf Association (USGA).[18][19]The underlying principle of the rules is fairness. As stated on the back cover of the official rule book:There are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers.[20] Essentially, anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction, or played golf for money, is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs. However, amateur golfers may receive expenses which comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the Rules of Amateur Status.In addition to the officially printed rules, golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette. Etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety, fairness, pace of play, and a player's obligation to contribute to the care of the course. Though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules, players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyone's playing experience.Penalties are incurred in certain situations. They are counted towards a player's score as if there were extra swing(s) at the ball. Strokes are added for rule infractions or for hitting one's ball into an unplayable situation.A lost ball or a ball hit out of bounds result in a penalty of one stroke and distance (Rule 271). A one-stroke penalty is assessed if a player's equipment causes the ball to move or the removal of a loose impediment causes the ball to move (Rule 182). If a golfer makes a stroke at the wrong ball (Rule 192) or hits a fellow golfer's ball with a putt (Rule 195), the player incurs a two-stroke penalty. Most rule infractions lead to stroke penalties but also can lead to disqualification. Disqualification could be from cheating, signing for a lower score, or from rule infractions that lead to improper play.[21]Golf clubs are used to hit the golf ball. Each club is composed of a shaft with a lance (or 'grip') on the top end and a club head on the bottom. Long clubs, which have a lower amount of degreed loft, are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance, and short clubs a higher degree of loft and a comparatively shorter distance. Typically, the actual physical length of each club is longer or shorter, depending on the distance the club is intended to propel the ball.Golf clubs have traditionally been arranged into three basic types. Woods are large-headed, long-shafted clubs meant to propel the ball a long distance from relatively "open" lies, such as the tee box and fairway. Of particular importance is the driver or "1-wood", which is the lowest lofted wood club, and in modern times has become highly specialized for making extremely long-distance tee shots, up to 300 yards or more in the hands of a professional golfer. Traditionally these clubs had heads made of a hardwood, hence the name, but virtually all modern woods are now made of metal such as titanium, or of composite materials. Irons are shorter-shafted clubs with a metal head primarily consisting of a flat, angled striking face. Traditionally the clubhead was forged from iron; modern iron clubheads are investment-cast from a steel alloy. Irons of varying loft are used for a variety of shots from virtually anywhere on the course, but most often for shorter-distance shots approaching the green, or to get the ball out of tricky lies such as sand traps. The third class is the putter, which evolved from the irons to create a low-lofted, balanced club designed to roll the ball along the green and into the hole. Putters are virtually always used on the green or in the surrounding rough/fringe. A fourth class, called hybrids, evolved as a cross between woods and irons, and are typically seen replacing the low-lofted irons with a club that provides similar distance, but a higher launch angle and a more forgiving nature.A maximum of 14 clubs is allowed in a player's bag at one time during a stipulated round. The choice of clubs is at the golfer's discretion, although every club must be constructed in accordance with parameters outlined in the rules. (Clubs which meet these parameters are usually called 'conforming'.) Violation of these rules can result in disqualification.The exact shot hit at any given time on a golf course, and which club is used to accomplish the shot, are always completely at the discretion of the golfer; in other words, there is no restriction whatsoever on which club a golfer may or may not use at any time for any shot.Golf balls are spherical, usually white (although other colors are allowed), and minutely pock-marked by dimples that decrease aerodynamic drag by increasing air turbulence around the ball in motion, which delays "boundary layer" separation and reduces the drag-inducing "wake" behind the ball, thereby allowing the ball to fly farther.[22]A tee is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole, unless the player must hit a provisional tee shot or replay his or her first shot from the tee.Many golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction, thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots. A golf bag is used to transport golf clubs and the player's other or personal equipment. Golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees, balls, and gloves. Golf bags can be carried, pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play. Golf bags have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying, and sometimes have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest.Golfers start with the non-dominant side of the body facing the target. At address the body and club are positioned parallel to the target line. The feet are commonly shoulder-width apart for middle irons and putters, narrower for short irons and wider for long irons and woods. The ball is positioned in the centre of the player's stance for short irons and putters, more to the front for middle irons and even more for long irons and woods. The golfer chooses a golf club, grip, and stroke appropriate to the distance:Having chosen a club and stroke to produce the desired distance, the player addresses the ball by taking their stance to the side of it and (except when the ball lies in a hazard) grounding the club behind the ball. The golfer then takes their backswing, rotating the club, their arms and their upper body away from the ball, and then begins their swing, bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball. A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions, and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of difference in how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels. The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single "plane" of motion of the club and clubhead, to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction.Accuracy and consistency is typically stressed over pure distance. A player with a straight drive that only travels 220 yards will nevertheless be able to accurately place the ball into a favorable lie on the fairway, and can make up for the lesser distance of any given club by simply using "more club" (a lower loft) on their tee shot or on subsequent fairway and approach shots. However, a golfer with a drive that may go 280 yards but often doesn't fly straight will be less able to position their ball advantageously; the ball may "hook", "pull", "draw", "fade", "push" or "slice" off the intended line and land out of bounds or in the rough or hazards, and thus the player will require many more strokes to hole out.A hole is classified by its par, meaning the number of strokes a skilled golfer should require to complete play of the hole.[13] Par always includes a stroke for the tee shot and two putts, so the minimum par of any hole is 3, but pars of 4 and 5 strokes are common, and a few courses feature par-6 and even par-7 holes. Strokes other than the tee shot and putts are expected to be made from the fairway; for example, a skilled golfer expects to reach the green on a par-4 hole in two strokesone from the tee (the 'drive') and another, second, stroke to the green (the 'approach')and then roll the ball into the hole in two putts for par. Putting the ball on the green with two strokes remaining for putts is called making "green in regulation" or GIR.[23]The primary factor for classifying the par of a relatively straight, hazard-free hole is the distance from the tee to the green. A typical par-3 hole is less than 250 yards (225 m) in length, with a par-4 hole ranging between 251 and 475 yards (225434 m), and a par-5 hole being longer than 475 yards (435 m). The rare par-6s can stretch well over 650 yards (595 m). These distances are based on the typical scratch golfer's drive distance of between 240-280 yards; a green further than the average player's drive will require additional shots from the fairway. However, other considerations must be taken into account; the key question is "how many strokes would a scratch golfer take to make the green by playing along the fairway?". The grade of the land from the tee to the hole might increase or decrease the carry and rolling distance of shots as measured linearly along the ground. Sharp turns or hazards may require golfers to "lay up" on the fairway in order to change direction or hit over the hazard with their next shot. These design considerations will affect how even a scratch golfer would play the hole, irrespective of total distance from tee to green, and must be included in a determination of par.[24] However, a par score never includes "expected" penalty strokes, as a scratch player is never "expected" to hit a ball into a water hazard or other unplayable situation. So, the placement of hazards only affect par when considering how a scratch golfer would avoid them.Eighteen-hole courses typically total to an overall par score of 72 for a complete round; this would be four par-3, ten par-4, and four par-5 holes, though other combinations exist and are not less worthy than courses of par-72. Many major championships are contested on courses playing to a par of 70, 71, or 72 (typically reducing the number of par-4 holes for par-3s and trading distance for difficulty). Additionally, in some countries, courses are classified according to their play difficulty, which may be used to calculate a golfer's playing handicap for a given course.[25] Two par-72 courses may have different difficulties; the more difficult course will typically have distances in the upper end of each par rating, more hazards, narrower or "shallower" fairways, hillier or more uneven terrain, etc. which all make the course harder to play even when the basic par score determinants are the same.In every form of play, the goal is to play as few strokes per round as possible. A golfer's score is usually expressed as the difference between the player's number of strokes and the par score. A hole in one (or an 'ace') occurs when a golfer sinks his ball into the cup with his first stroke from the tee. Common scores for a hole also have specific terms.[13]In match play, two players (or two teams) play each hole as a separate contest against each other. The party with the lower score wins that hole, or if the scores of both players or teams are equal the hole is 'halved' (or tied). The game is won by the party that wins more holes than the other. In the case that one team or player has taken a lead that cannot be overcome in the number of holes remaining to be played, the match is deemed to be won by the party in the lead, and the remainder of the holes are not played. For example, if one party already has a lead of six holes, and only five holes remain to be played on the course, the match is over and the winning party is deemed to have won "6 & 5". At any given point, if the lead is equal to the number of holes remaining, the party leading the match is said to be 'dormie', and the match is continued until the party increases the lead by one hole or ties any of the remaining holes, thereby winning the match, or until the match ends in a tie with the lead player's opponent winning all remaining holes. When the game is tied after the predetermined number of holes have been played, it may be continued until one side takes a one-hole lead.[13]In stroke play, the score achieved for each and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score, and the player with the lowest score wins. Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers. If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players. Playoffs are either sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes, anywhere from three to a full 18. In sudden death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match. If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes, then play continues in sudden death format, where the first player to win a hole wins the tournament.A skins game is a variation on match play where each hole has an amount of money (the "skin") attached. This may be prize money at the professional level (the most famous event to use these rules was the "LG Skins Game" played at Indian Wells Golf Resort in California until 2008), or an amount wagered for each hole among amateur players. The player with the lowest score on the hole wins the skin for that hole; if two or more players tie for the lowest score, the skin carries over to the next hole. This continues until a player wins a hole outright, which may (and often does) result in a player receiving money for a previous hole that they hadn't tied for. If players tie the 18th hole, either all players or only the tying players repeat the 18th hole until an outright winner is decided for that hole (and all undecided skins).A 9-point game is another variant of match play typically played among threesomes, where each hole is worth a total of 9 points. The player with the lowest score on a hole receives 5 points, the next-lowest score 3 and the next-lowest score 1. Ties are generally resolved by summing the points contested and dividing them among the tying players; a two-way tie for first is worth 4 points to both players, a two-way tie for second is worth 2 points to both players, and a three-way tie is worth 3 points to each player. The player with the highest score after 18 holes (in which there are 162 points to be awarded) wins the game. This format can be used to wager on the game systematically; players each contribute the same amount of money to the pot, and a dollar value is assigned to each point scored (or each point after 18) based on the amount of money in the pot, with any overage going to the overall winner.[26][27]The Stableford system is a simplification of stroke play which awards players points based on their score relative to the hole's par; the score for a hole is calculated by taking the par score, adding 2, then subtracting the player's hole score, making the result zero if negative. Alternately stated, a double bogey or worse is zero points, a bogey is worth one point, par is two, a birdie three, an eagle four, and so on. The advantages of this system over stroke play are a more natural "higher is better" scoring, the ability to compare Stableford scores between plays on courses with different total par scores (scoring an "even" in stroke play will always give a Stableford score of 36), discouraging the tendency to abandon the entire game after playing a particularly bad hole (a novice playing by strict rules may score as high as an 8 or 10 on a single difficult hole; their Stableford score for the hole would be zero, which only puts them two points behind par no matter how badly they played), and the ability to simply pick up one's ball once it is impossible to score any points for the hole, which speeds play.The USGA and R&A sanction a "Modified Stableford" system for scratch players, which makes par worth zero, a birdie worth 2, eagle 5 and double-eagle 8, while a bogey is a penalty of -1 and a double-bogey -3. As with the original system, the highest score wins the game, and terrible scores on one or two holes won't wreck an entire game, but this system rewards "bogey-birdie" play more than the original, encouraging golfers to try to make the riskier birdie putt or eagle chipshot instead of simply parring each hole.[13]Shotgun starts are mainly used for amateur tournament play. In this variant, each of the groups playing starts their game on a different hole, allowing for all players to start and end their round at roughly the same time. All 18 holes are still played, but a player or foursome may, for instance, start on hole 5, play through to the 18th hole, then continue with hole 1 and end on hole 4. This speeds the completion of the entire event as players are not kept waiting for progressive tee times at the first hole. This form of play, as a minor variation to stroke or match play, is neither defined nor disallowed by strict rules and so is used according to local rules for an event.A handicap is a numerical measure of an amateur golfer's ability to play golf over the course of 18 holes. A player's handicap generally represents the number of strokes above par that the player will make over the course of an above-average round of golf. The lower the handicap, the better the player. Someone with a handicap of 0 or less is often called a scratch golfer, and would typically score or beat the course par on a round of play (depending on course difficulty).Calculating a handicap is often complicated. By USGA rules, it first requires calculating a "Handicap Differential" for each round of play the player has completed by strict rules. That in itself is a function of the player's "gross adjusted score" (adjustments can be made to mitigate various deviations either from strict rules or from a player's normal capabilities, for handicap purposes only) and two course-specific difficulty ratings: the Course Rating, a calculated expected score for a hypothetical "scratch golfer": and the Slope Rating, a number based on how much worse a hypothetical 20-handicap "bogey golfer" would score compared to the "scratch golfer". The average Slope Rating of all USGA-rated courses as of 2012 is 113, which also factors into the Differential computation.The most recent Differentials are logged, up to 20 of them, and then the best of these (the number used depends on the number available) are selected, averaged, multiplied by .96 (an "excellence factor" that encourages high handicappers to play better and thus lower their handicap), and truncated to the tenths place to produce the "Handicap Index". Additional calculations can be used to place higher significance on a player's recent tournament scores. A player's Handicap Index is then multiplied by the Slope Rating of the course to be played, divided by the average Slope Rating of 113, then rounded to the nearest integer to produce the player's Course Handicap.Once calculated, the Course Handicap is applied in stroke play by simply reducing the player's gross score by the handicap, to produce a net score. So, a gross score of 96 with a handicap of 22 would produce a net score of 74. In match play, the lower handicap is subtracted from the higher handicap, and the resulting handicap strokes are awarded to the higher handicapper by distributing them among the holes according to each hole's difficulty; holes are ranked on the scorecard from 1 to 18 (or however many holes are available), and one stroke is applied to each hole from the most difficult to the least difficult. So, if one player has a 9 handicap and another has a 25 handicap, the 25-handicap player receives one handicap stroke on each of the most difficult 16 holes (25-9). If the 25-handicapper were playing against a "scratch golfer" (zero handicap), all 25 strokes would be distributed, first by applying one stroke to each hole, then applying the remaining strokes, one each, to the most difficult 7 holes; so, the handicap player would subtract 2 strokes from each of the most difficult 7 holes, and 1 each from the remaining 11.Handicap systems have potential for abuse by players who may intentionally play badly to increase their handicap ("throwing their 'cap") before playing to their potential at an important event with a valuable prize. For this reason, professional golf associations do not use them, but they can be calculated and used along with other criteria to determine the relative strengths of various professional players. Touring professionals, being the best of the best, often have negative handicaps; they can be expected, on average, to score lower than the Course Rating on any course.In 2005, Golf Digest calculated that the countries with most golf courses per capita, starting with the best endowed were: Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Canada, Wales, United States, Sweden, and England (countries with fewer than 500,000 people were excluded). Apart from Sweden, all of these countries have English as the majority language, but the number of courses in new territories is increasing rapidly.The most notable example of this phenomenon is the expansion of golf in China. The first golf course in China opened in 1984, but by the end of 2009 there were roughly 600 in the country. For the last several years, development of new golf courses in China has been officially banned (with the exception of the island province of Hainan), but the number of courses has nonetheless tripled since 2004; the "ban" has been easily evaded with the government's tacit approval simply by not mentioning golf in any development plans.[33]In the United States, the number of people who play golf twenty-five times or more per year decreased from 6.9million in 2000 to 4.6million in 2005,[34] according to the National Golf Foundation. The NGF reported that the number who played golf at all decreased from 30 to 26 million over the same period.[34]Number of golf courses by country in 2008[35]The majority of professional golfers work as club or teaching professionals ('pros'), and only compete in local competitions. A small elite of professional golfers are 'tournament pros' who compete full-time on international 'tours'. Many club and teaching professionals working in the golf industry start as caddies or with a general interest in the game, finding employment at golf courses and eventually moving on to certifications in their chosen profession. These programs include independent institutions and universities, and those that eventually lead to a Class A golf professional certification. Touring professionals typically start as amateur players, who attain their "pro" status after success in major tournaments that win them either prize money and/or notice from corporate sponsors. Jack Nicklaus, for example, gained widespread notice by finishing second in the 1960 U.S. Open to champion Arnold Palmer, with a 72-hole score of 282 (the best score to date in that tournament by an amateur). He played one more amateur year in 1961, winning that year's U.S. Amateur Championship, before turning pro in 1962.Golf instruction involves the teaching and learning of the game of golf. Proficiency in teaching golf instruction requires not only technical and physical ability, but also knowledge of the rules and etiquette of the game. In some countries, golf instruction is best performed by teachers certified by the Professional Golfers Association. Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right. Instructors use a combination of physical conditioning, mental visualization, classroom sessions, club fitting, driving range instruction, on-course play under real conditions, and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf.There are at least twenty professional golf tours, each run by a PGA or an independent tour organization, which is responsible for arranging events, finding sponsors, and regulating the tour. Typically a tour has "members" who are entitled to compete in most of its events, and also invites non-members to compete in some of them. Gaining membership of an elite tour is highly competitive, and most professional golfers never achieve it.Perhaps the most widely known tour is the PGA Tour, which tends to attract the strongest fields, outside the four Majors and the four World Golf Championships events. This is due mostly to the fact that most PGA Tour events have a first prize of at least US$800,000. The European Tour, which attracts a substantial number of top golfers from outside North America, ranks second to the PGA Tour in worldwide prestige. Some top professionals from outside North America play enough tournaments to maintain membership on both the PGA Tour and European Tour.The other leading men's tours include the Japan Golf Tour, the Asian Tour (Asia outside Japan), the PGA Tour of Australasia, and the Sunshine Tour (for southern Africa, primarily South Africa). The Japan, Australasian, Sunshine, PGA, and European Tours are the charter members of the trade body of the world's main tours, the International Federation of PGA Tours, founded in 1996. The Asian Tour became a full member in 1999. The Canadian Tour became an associate member of the Federation in 2000, and the Tour de las Amricas (Latin America) became an associate member of the Federation in 2007. The Federation underwent a major expansion in 2009 which saw eleven new tours become full members  the Canadian Tour, Tour de las Amricas, China Golf Association, the Korea Professional Golfers' Association, Professional Golf Tour of India, and the operators of all six major women's tours worldwide. The OneAsia Tour, founded in 2009, is not a member of the Federation, but was founded as a joint venture of the Australasia, China, Japan, and Korean tours. In 2011, the Tour de las Amricas was effectively taken over by the PGA Tour, and in 2012 was folded into the new PGA Tour Latinoamrica. All of the men's tours that are Federation members, except the China and India tours, offer points in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) to players who place sufficiently high in their events. The OneAsia Tour also offers ranking points.Golf is unique in having lucrative competition for older players. There are several senior tours for men aged fifty and over, arguably the best known of which is the U.S.-based Champions Tour.There are six principal tours for women, each based in a different country or continent. The most prestigious of these is the United States based LPGA Tour. All of the principal tours offer points in the Women's World Golf Rankings for high finishers in their events.All of the leading professional tours for under-50 players have an official developmental tour, in which the leading players at the end of the season will earn a tour card on the main tour for the following season. Examples include the Web.com Tour, which feeds to the PGA Tour, and the Challenge Tour, which is the developmental tour of the European Tour. The Web.com and Challenge Tours also offer OWGR points.The major championships are the four most prestigious men's tournaments of the year. In chronological order they are: The Masters, the U.S. Open, The Open Championship (referred to in North America as the British Open) and the PGA Championship.[36]The fields for these events include the top several dozen golfers from all over the world. The Masters has been played at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, since its inception in 1934. It is the only major championship that is played at the same course each year.[37] The U.S. Open and PGA Championship are played at courses around the United States, while the Open Championship is played at courses around the United Kingdom.[38][39][40]Prior to the advent of the PGA Championship and The Masters, the four Majors were the U.S. Open, the U.S. Amateur, the Open Championship, and the British Amateur.Women's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors. The list of majors recognised by the dominant women's tour, the LPGA Tour in the U.S., has changed several times over the years, with the last change in 2001. Like the PGA Tour, the (U.S.) LPGA[41] has four majors: the Kraft Nabisco Championship, the LPGA Championship, the U.S. Women's Open and the Women's British Open. Only the last of these is also recognised by the Ladies European Tour. The other event that it recognises as a major is the Evian Masters, which is currently sanctioned by the LPGA only as a regular tour event but will become a major on that tour in 2013. However, the significance of this is limited, as the LPGA is far more dominant in women's golf than the PGA Tour is in mainstream men's golf. For example, the BBC has been known to use the U.S. definition of "women's majors" without qualifying it. Also, the Ladies' Golf Union, the governing body for women's golf in the UK and Republic of Ireland, has stated on its official website that the Women's British Open is "the only Women's Major to be played outside the U.S."[42] For many years, the Ladies European Tour tacitly acknowledged the dominance of the LPGA Tour by not scheduling any of its own events to conflict with the three LPGA majors played in the U.S., but that changed beginning in 2008, when the LET scheduled an event opposite the LPGA Championship. The second-richest women's tour, the LPGA of Japan Tour, does not recognise any of the U.S. LPGA or European majors as it has its own set of majors (historically three, since 2008 four). However, these events attract little notice outside Japan.Senior (aged fifty and over) men's golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors. The list of senior majors on the U.S.-based Champions Tour has changed over the years, but always by expansion. The Champions Tour now recognises five majors: the Senior PGA Championship, the United States Senior Open, the Senior British Open Championship, The Tradition and the Senior Players Championship.Of the five events, the Senior PGA is by far the oldest, having been founded in 1937. The other events all date from the 1980s, when senior golf became a commercial success as the first golf stars of the television era, such as Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, reached the relevant age. The Senior British Open was not recognised as a major by the Champions Tour until 2003. The European Seniors Tour recognises only the Senior PGA and the two Senior Opens as majors. However, the Champions Tour is arguably more dominant in global senior golf than the U.S. LPGA is in global women's golf.  1 Origin2 Golf course3 Play of the game4 Rules and regulations

The goal of the chip is to land the ball safely on the green, allowing it to roll out towards the hole. It can also be used from other places to accurately position the ball into a more advantageous lie.The "putt" is used in short-distance shots on or near the green, typically made with the eponymous "putter", although similar strokes can be made with medium to high-numbered irons to carry a short distance in the air and then roll (a "bump and run"). The goal of the putt is to put the ball in the hole, although a long-distance putt may be called a "lag" and is made with the primary intention of simply closing distance to the hole or otherwise placing the ball advantageously.Foursome: defined in Rule 29, this is played between two teams of two players each, in which each team has only one ball and players alternate playing it. For example, if players 'A' and 'B' form a team, 'A' tees off on the first hole, 'B' will play the second shot, 'A' the third, and so on until the hole is finished. On the second hole, 'B' will tee off (regardless who played the last putt on the first hole), then 'A' plays the second shot, and so on. Foursomes can be played as match play or stroke play.[28]Fourball: defined in Rules 30 and 31, this is also played between two teams of two players each, but every player plays their own ball and for each team, the lower score on each hole counts. Fourballs can be played as match play or stroke play.[29]Scramble: also known as ambrose or best-shot; each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has come to rest (and no closer to the hole), and the procedure is repeated until the hole is finished.Champagne scramble: a combination of a scramble and best-ball, only the first shot of each hole is a scramble; all players tee off, decide on the best tee shot, then each player plays their own ball starting at that point until they hole out, without deciding any further "best shots". The best score amongst the team's players is counted.[30]Better ball or best-ball: like fourball, each player plays the hole as normal, but the lowest score of all the players on the team counts as the team's score.[31]Greensome: also called modified alternate shot, this is played in pairs; both players tee off, and then pick the best shot as in a scramble. The player who did not shoot the best first shot plays the second shot. The play then alternates as in a foursome.[32] A variant of greensome is sometimes played where the opposing team chooses which of their opponent's tee shots the opponents should use. The player who did not shoot the chosen first shot plays the second shot. Play then continues as a greensome.Golf at the Asian GamesGolf at the Summer OlympicsGlossary of golfGolfers with most Asian Tour winsGolfers with most Champions Tour major championship winsGolfers with most Champions Tour winsGolfers with most European Tour winsGolfers with most Japan Golf Tour winsGolfers with most LPGA major championship winsGolfers with most LPGA Tour winsLists of golfersList of men's major championships winning golfersList of years in golfList of golfers with most PGA Tour winsProfessional Golfers' Association of AmericaOfficial World Golf RankingsPolish Golf UnionPresidents CupRyder CupSolheim CupSeve TrophyLexus CupWalker CupCurtis CupSolar Golf CartGolf ChannelGolf DigestGolf MagazineGolf WorldLinks (magazine)Travel + Leisure GolfGolf Video GamesVariations of golfThe R&A, St AndrewsUSGA: United States Golf AssociationGolf Australia, national governing body of AustraliaInternational Golf Federation (IGF)

This is a list of Ponzi schemes, fraudulent investment operations that pay returns to separate investors from their own money or money paid by subsequent investors, rather than from any actual profit earned.Other notable (but involving smaller amounts of money) Ponzi schemes include:1 Historical examples

Miller promised 10% a week interest and exploited some of the main themes of Ponzi schemes such as customers reinvesting the interest they made. He defrauded buyers out of $1 million and was sentenced to jail for 10 years. After he was pardoned, he opened a grocery store on Long Island. During the Ponzi investigation, Miller was interviewed by the Boston Post to compare his scheme to Ponzi's  the interviewer found them remarkably similar, but Ponzi's became more famous for taking in seven times as much money.[1]Charles PonziIvar Kreuger, a Swedish businessman, known as the "match king", built a Ponzi scheme, defrauding investors based on the supposedly fantastic profitability, and ever expanding nature, of his match monopolies. The scheme soon collapsed in the 1930s, and Kreuger shot himself.[2]Between 1970 and 1984 in Portugal, a woman known as Dona Branca maintained a scheme that paid 10% monthly interest. In 1988 she was sentenced to 10 years in prison. She always claimed that she was only trying to help the poor, but in her trial it was proven that she had received the equivalent of 85 million (almost US$120 million).[3][4]In January 1984 Adriaan Nieuwoudt started the so-called "Kubus" scheme with an apparent beauty product in South Africa. Subscribers to the scheme bought a supposedly biological substance called an "activator", that was used to grow cultures in milk. After growing for a week or two, the cultures were harvested and dried, and sold back to the scheme. The cultures were never used for a beauty product but were simply ground up and resold to further investors as activators.[5] Other schemes by Nieuwoudt include investment in a holiday resort and a scheme involving collecting useless old postage stamps. He is seeking investors for a get-rich-quick coaline mining operating on his farm.Sixteen hundred investors in Diamond Mortgage Company and A.J. Obie, two firms with the same managers, lost approximately $50 million in what the Michigan Court of Appeals described as "the largest reported 'Ponzi' scheme in the history of the state". It led to the passage in 1987 of the Mortgage Brokers, Lenders, and Servicers Act.[6][7]In the 1980s in San Diego, California, J. David & Company, an alleged currency and commodity trading and investing operation named after its founder, J. David Dominelli, a withdrawn and shy currency and commodity trader, was revealed to be a Ponzi scheme which took in $200 million and returned $120 million to investors, leaving a net loss of $80 million. The scheme touched all levels of upper class business and professional life in San Diego and environs, and involved the mayor of Del Mar, California, a cozy upscale beach town just north of La Jolla, who was J. David's assistant and live-in companion, and others, including the prominent New York law firm Rogers & Wells (now Clifford Chance), which had advised J. David (through a rogue partner) and others.[8][9][10][11][12] When the fall came, J. David briefly escaped to Montserrat in the Caribbean, but was returned ultimately to plead guilty to federal charges and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment[13], serving 10 before being paroled.Between 1978 and 1983, Ron Rewald ran an investment firm in Hawaii. The firm declared bankruptcy in 1983 and was revealed to have been a Ponzi scheme which defrauded over 400 investors of more than $22 million.[14] Rewald claimed that he had been operating the firm as a front for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.[15] Rewald was convicted and sentenced to 80 years in prison; he was paroled in 1995. was a Russian company that perpetrated one of the world's largest Ponzi schemes of all time. By different estimates from 5 to 40 million people lost up to $10 billion. The company started attracting money from private investors, promising annual returns of up to one thousand percent. It is unclear whether a Ponzi scheme was the initial intention, as such extravagant returns might have been possible during the Russian hyperinflation in such commerce as import-export.In Romania, between 1991 and 1994, the Caritas scheme run by the "Caritas" company of Cluj-Napoca, owned by Ioan Stoica promised eight times the money invested in six months. It attracted 400,000 depositors from all over the country who invested 1,257 billion lei (about US$1 billion) before it finally went bankrupt on August 14, 1994, having a debt of US$450 million. The owner, Ioan Stoica, was sentenced in 1995 by the Cluj Court to a total of seven years in prison for fraud, but he appealed and it was reduced to two years; then he went on to the Supreme Court of Justice and the sentence was finally reduced to one year and a half.In late 1994, the European Kings Club collapsed, with ensuing losses of about $1.1 billion. This scam was led by Damara Bertges and Hans Gnther Spachtholz. In the Swiss cantons Uri and Glarus, it was estimated that about one adult in ten invested into the EKC. The scam involved buying "letters" valued at 1,400 Swiss francs that entitled buyers to receive 12 monthly payments of 200 Swiss francs. The organisation was based in Gelnhausen, Germany.[16]In early 1996, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil action against Bennett Funding Group, its chief financial officer, Patrick R. Bennett, and other companies Bennett controlled, in connection with a massive Ponzi scheme. The companies fraudulently raised hundreds of millions of dollars, purportedly to purchase assignments of equipment leases and promissory notes.[17]From 1993 until 1997 a church named Greater Ministries International in Tampa, Florida, headed by Gerald Payne bilked over 18,000 people out of $500 million.[18] Payne and other church elders promised the church members double their money back, citing Biblical scripture. However, nearly all the money was lost or hidden away. Church leaders received prison sentences ranging from 13 to 27 years.In the mid-1990s, Albania was transitioning into a liberalized market economy after years under a State-controlled economy reinforced by the cult of personality involving longtime Communist leader Enver Hoxha; the rudimentary financial system became dominated by pyramid schemes, and government officials tacitly endorsed a series of pyramid investment funds. Many Albanians, approximately two-thirds of the population, invested in them. In 1997, Albanians, who had lost $1.2 billion, took their protest to the streets where uncontainable rioting and attacks on government infrastructure led to the toppling of the government and the temporary existence of a stateless society. Although technically a Ponzi Scheme, the Albanian scams were commonly referred to as pyramid schemes both popularly and by the International Monetary Fund.[19]In 1997, South African businessman Kenny Kunene was convicted of running a Ponzi scheme with over 2,000 investors and sentenced to six years in prison.[20]In Delhi, India, Hoffland Finance collapsed amid a major scandal in 1998. Hoffland, a category II merchant banker, had been suspended by SEBI, which directed it to refrain from undertaking any new portfolio management assignments. It had floated a scheme, called "Invest Card", that lured investors with a return of 27 per cent annually.[21]In 2001, the Haitian population fell prey to Ponzi schemers offering rates up to 15%. The outfits, called "cooperatives", appeared to be implicitly backed by the government and became wildly popular in the population at large, who felt safe since the co-ops were openly advertising in the radio and TV ads using Haitian pop stars as spokespeople. It is estimated that more than $240 million was swindled from investors, equivalent to 60% of the country's GDP.[22]The Brothers was a large investment operation in Costa Rica, eventually exposed as a Ponzi scheme, from the late 1980s until 2002. The fund was operated by brothers Luis Enrique and Osvaldo Villalobos. Investigators determined that the scam took in at least $400 million. Most of the clientele were American and Canadian retirees but some Costa Ricans also invested the minimum $10,000. About 6,300 individuals ultimately were involved. Interest rates were 3% per month, usually paid in cash, or 2.8% compounded. The ability to pay such high interest was attributed to Luis Enrique Villalobos' existing agricultural aviation business, investment in unspecified European high yield funds, and loans to Coca Cola, among others. Osvaldo Villalobos' role was primarily to move money around a large number of shell companies and then pay investors. In May 2007, Osvaldo Villalobos was sentenced to 18 years in prison for fraud and illegal banking, while Luis Enrique Villalobos remains a fugitive.[23]In 2003, the SEC shut down a $1 billion scheme by Mutual Benefits Company in Florida, run by Peter Lombardi, affecting 28,000 investors. Mutual claimed it used the money to pay viaticals settlements to HIV patients. Lombardi is now serving a 20-year prison sentence.[24]In 2004, the SEC fined Raymond James $6.9 million for failure to supervise former broker Dennis Herula, who was accused of participating with others in a Ponzi scheme that raised about $44.5 million from investors in 1999-2000. Herula himself raised about $16.5 million of investor funds, most of which was later transferred to his wife's brokerage account at Raymond James; he was arrested in Bermuda and extradited to the United states where he pleaded guilty to fraud and was sentenced to 15 years and eight months imprisonment.[25]In February 2005, Moshe Leichner and his son Zvi [26] were sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for running a Ponzi scheme[27] through a commodities futures trading firm, Midland Euro[28] that defrauded hundreds of investors out of more than $95 million, including Dean Tanella[29] of GunnAllen Financial[30] (shut down by regulators in March 2010 for fraud allegations and losses related to another Ponzi scheme[31]) and Safe Harbor Capital Management (now dba HarborLight Capital Management)[32] which lost $40 million[33] for their investors.In May 2006, James Paul Lewis, Jr. was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison for running a $311 million Ponzi scheme over a 20 years. He operated under the name Financial Advisory Consultants from Lake Forest, California.[34]In October 2006 in Malaysia, two prominent members of society and several others were held for running an alleged scam, known as SwissCash or Swiss Mutual Fund (1948). SwissCash offered returns of up to 300% within a 15-month investment period. Currently, this HYIP investment is offered to citizens of Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. It claimed investors' funds were channeled to business activities ranging from oil exploration to shipping and agriculture in the Caribbean. The company claims to be operating out of New York and incorporated in the Commonwealth of Dominica.[35][36][37]In Oct, 2006 Gregory Nathan, a Sydney fund manager, was arrested on charges including dishonest conduct and obtaining money by making false and misleading statements, in what investigators discovered to have been a Ponzi scheme. Nathan, a notorious gambler, reported returns that were always stellar, prompting many to invest their life savings, and he didn't discriminate when it came to pitching his investment opportunities with victims including his mother, his girlfriend, his flatmate, the elderly and handicapped. Nathan falsely reported his fund had $22 million under management, when the most it could have had at any one time was approximately $4.9 million. From 2001 - 2006 an estimated $8.8 million was lost by an untold number of investors, believed to be in the hundreds. In a desperate late bid to perpetuate the scheme, Nathan sent an email to existing clients on Oct 9, 2006 just days before placing his companies in administration, encouraging them to increase their investment. On 19 Sept, 2008, Nathan was sentenced to seven years imprisonment including with a non-parole period of five years.[38]On June 27, 2007, former boy band mogul Lou Pearlman was indicted by a grand jury on several counts of fraud and money laundering which for running a $500 million Ponzi scheme over 20 years; he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.[39]On August 17, 2007, the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) filed syndicated estafa cases against 27 officers and investors of FrancSwiss Investment, a Ponzi pyramiding scam on the Internet. Charged were Michael Mansfield, chief financial officer; Kurt Sandelman, risk management team leader; Rupert Benedict Da Vinco, investment team leader; Julia Rodriguez, international banking team leader; Hector Willem Sidberg, marketing and international affairs; and Fernando Munoz, customer service leader; Roger Smith, the British chief operation officer of FS Investment in the Asia-Pacific region; Bensy Fong, the Singaporean system operation officer; Raymond Chua, Singaporean marketing officer; a certain Michelle and Mike, Filipino secretaries and collectors of money from investors; 16 investors, including arrested suspect Eleazard Castillo, 26, a native of Cabuyao, Ilocos Sur, allegedly one of the financial advisers of FrancSwiss Investment. 41 investors claimed they lost a total of $75,000 to the investment scheme. FrancSwiss deceived investors in the Philippines of 1 billion ($50 million).[40]In the third and the biggest Philippines Ponzi scam (involving $150 million and $250 million), criminal charges, based on suit filed by 21,000 complainants were filed on June, 2008, with the Department of Justice, against Performance Investments Products Corp (PIPC) officers and incorporators for violation of the Securities Regulation Code (SRC), versus: Singaporean national Michael H.K. Liew, PIPC president; Cristina Gonzalez-Tuason, general manager, and other officers and agents - Ma. Cristina Bautista-Jurado, Barbara Garcia, Anthony Kierulf, Eugene Go, Michael Melchor Nubla, Ma. Pamela Morris, Luis Aragon, Renato Sarmiento Jr., Victor Jose Vergel de Dios, Nicoline Amoranto Mendoza, Jose Tengco III, Oudine Santos and Herley Jesuitas.[41]The WexTrust Investment firm was shut down on August 1, 2008 by the Securities and Exchange Commission, charging that WexTrust and two of its owners (Joseph Shereshevsky of Norfolk and Steven Byers of Oak Brook, Ill) operated a Ponzi-type scheme by promising unusually high returns to earlier investors and paying them with money raised from later investors. The SEC case, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleged that WexTrust and the two men defrauded investors by diverting at least $100 million to unauthorized uses. WexTrust targeted the Orthodox Jewish community, particularly in Norfolk, VA and New York City. The receiver, Timothy Coleman, has returned only 2% of principal to WexTrust investors. [42] Shereshevsky and Byers pleaded guilty to securities fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy, and were sentenced to 21 years and 10 months and 13 years and four months imprisonment respectively, in addition to being ordered to make restitution and disgorge their gains.[43]Minnesota, USA - orchestrated by Saint Cloud, Minnesota celebrity businessman Tom Petters. On December 1, 2008 Tom Petters was charged by the Federal government as the mastermind behind a $3.65 billion Ponzi scheme that bilked investors over a 13-year period. Petters lived an extravagant lifestyle supported by his Ponzi scheme. Petters faces 20 counts of wire and mail fraud, Conspiracy, and money laundering for the alleged investment scheme that ran from 1995 through September 2008. He is expected to plead not guilty, but his co-conspirators in the Ponzi scheme, Deanna Coleman, Robert White, Michael Catain, and Larry Reynolds, have all pled guilty. The Petters Ponzi scheme came to an end when Petters' top co-conspirator Deanna Coleman turned government informant and wore a wire. Petters and the others were planning to flee to countries without extradition agreements with the U.S. Deanna Coleman and Michael Catain had properties in Costa Rica. On December 2, 2009, Tom Petters was found guilty in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota on 20 counts of wire and mail fraud.[44] The US federal government is now seeking forfeiture of all Petters' assets. He later was convicted for turning Petters Group Worldwide into a $3.65 billion Ponzi scheme and was sentenced to 50 years in federal prison. Reporters from the Minneapolis Star Tribune stated that it is extremely unlikely that Petters will ever again live as a free citizen.On December 10, 2008, Bernard Madoff made an admission to his sons that his investments were "all one big lie". The following day he was arrested and charged with a single count of securities fraud.[45] As of December 2008[update] the losses were estimated to be $65 billion, making it the largest investor fraud in history.[46] Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison on June 29, 2009.On January 9, 2009, the SEC charged Joseph S. Forte from Broomall, Pennsylvania with masterminding a $50 million Ponzi scheme. He swindled over 80 investors, mostly close friends from 1995 to 2009. The SEC investigator called Forte a "complete fraud". Records show Forte used, for personal purposes, over $28 million.[47] He was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.On January 16, 2009, the Serious Fraud Office in the United Kingdom uncovered an 80 million buy-to-let property fraud scheme operating under a company called Practical Property Portfolio in which at least 1,750 investors were conned out of 25,000 each in return for a promise of a house in the North East of England. All five directors  John Potts, Peter Gosling, Natalie Laverick, Peter Graham, and Eric Armstrong  pled guilty to fraud and were sentenced in March 2009.[48]On January 26, 2009, Nicholas Cosmo, the founder of Agape World, surrendered to federal authorities in connection with a suspected $380 million Ponzi scheme. Previously convicted of fraud in 1999, Cosmo surrendered at the Long Island Rail Road train station in Hicksville, N.Y. and was sentenced to 50 years imprisonment.[49] In March 2009, a lawsuit was filed in New York against Bank of America, one of the largest banks in the United States, that claimed that Bank of America "established, equipped and staffed" a branch office in the headquarters of Mr. Cosmo's firm, Agape Merchant Advance. As a result, the lawsuit contends that the bank knowingly "assisted, facilitated and furthered" Mr. Cosmo's fraudulent scheme.[50]On February 9, 2009, the City of London Police Economic Crime Department arrested Terry Freeman, director of GFX Capital Markets Ltd, over a 40 million fraud which is possibly a Ponzi scheme.[51]On February 17, 2009, the Stanford International Bank and proprietor Allen Stanford were accused of "massive fraud" by U.S. authorities, and SIB's assets were frozen. The apparent Ponzi scheme drew in more than $8 billion of "deposits", many from investors in Latin America. He was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on June 14, 2009 and sentenced to 110 years imprisonment on June 14, 2012.[52]On February 25, 2009, the SEC charged James Nicholson for allegedly "defraud[ing] hundreds of investors of millions of dollars"[53]On March 13, 2009, a 67 year old Ohio woman named Joanne Schneider was sentenced to three years in prison, the minimum allowed, for operating a Ponzi scheme that cost investors an estimated $60 million.[54]On March 13, 2009, the SEC charged Brian J. Smart of Lehi, Utah, with securities fraud, saying he created a Ponzi scheme through which he defrauded elderly victims of $1.7 million.[55] On June 6, 2011, Federal Judge Dale Kimball ruled that Brian Smart was found to be responsible for losses in the amount of $2.05 million. He was fined a total of $4,715,580.[56] July 6th 2011, Brian Smart appealed in pro per, the courts ruling and the appellate courts issued a published ruling April 27th 2012, citing that Brian Smart had been manipulating the litigation process using the Fifth Amendment and upheld Judge Dale Kimballs ruling afferming the civil judgment.[57]December 15th 2011 Smart was named in a lawsuit for recovery of a fraudlent transfer of real property.[58]Also named in the suit were Wendell and Allen Jacobson, who, on the same day were indicted for the creation of a Ponzi-like real estate operation located in Fountain Green, UTAH.[59] April 18, 2012 the SEC filed admistrative actions upon Smart. [60]That case resulted in an ORDER MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS PURSUANT TO SECTION 203(f) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 In the Matter of BRIAN J. SMART, issuing a judgment banning him from the industry.[61] On September 12, 2012, Brian J. Smart was arrested in Utah[62] and extradited to California, who charged grand theft, forgery, money laundering and theft from an elderly person.[63][64] Smart is facing over 25 years in prison in the complaint issued by Tony Rackauckas, the current District Attorney of Orange County, California.On June 17, 2009, Donald Anthony Walker Young, who is known as Tony Young or Walker Young, had his office seized for using money from new investors to pay previous investors and using some of the money to purchase a vacation home in Palm Beach, Florida. Young operated the alleged Ponzi scheme through an investment partnership Acorn II L.P., which he established in 2001 to invest in publicly traded securities, authorities said. The SEC alleged in its 22-page complaint that the fraud began in mid-2005 and continued until recently. He was indicted on April 1, 2010;[65] pleaded guilty in July, 2010, to mail fraud and money laundering and was sentenced to 17-and-a-half years in prison in May, 2011.[66]On June 2, 2009, the Colorado State Grand Jury indicted Jason Trevor Brooks of Boulder, Colorado on 24 counts of security fraud and theft. Authorities allege that from June 2005 to February 2008, Brooks collected about $10 million from investors to invest, but then used a vast majority of the funds for personal expenses, gambling, and to make interest payments and payouts to other investors. Brooks, working under the Genius Inc. name, told investors he had a distribution agreement with Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. of Japan, which allowed him to purchase electronics and appliances as a distributor and then resell them for a profit to various home builders and other businesses, authorities said.[67] On April 27, 2010 Brooks pleaded guilty to twofelony counts of securities fraud.and two counts of making an untrue statement. He was sentenced to eight years in prison for each of the four counts, to run culmulatively for a total sentence of 32 years, and was also ordered to pay more than $5.1 million in restitution to his victims. [68]On June 12, 2009, investors were reported to have lost billions of South African Rands in a Ponzi scheme masterminded by Barry Tannenbaum.[69]On November 16, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged four individuals and two companies for perpetrating a Ponzi scheme to defraud over 300 investors of $30 million. Pennsylvania-based Mantria Corporation, run by executives Troy Wragg and Amanda Knorr, supposedly focused on green initiatives such as a "carbon negative" housing community in Tennessee and an organic waste-derived "biochar" charcoal substitute production plant. Between September 2007 through November 2009, Mantria Corporation raised funds through Denver-based Speed of Wealth LLC, run by Wayde and Donna McKelvy. The SEC alleged that Mantria and Speed of Wealth exaggerated the scope and success of Mantria's operations. Subsequent charges estimate Mantria and Speed of Wealth raised $54 million, of which they paid $17.5 million to investors, using investors' own funds to pay those returns.[70][71][72][73]December 1, 2009: Scott W. Rothstein, a disbarred lawyer and the former managing shareholder, chairman, and chief executive officer of the now-defunct Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler law firm was accused of funding his philanthropy, political contributions, law firm salaries, and an extravagant lifestyle with a massive $1.4 billion Ponzi scheme. Scott Rothstein turned himself in to federal authorities and was subsequently arrested on charges related to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).[74] Rothstein was denied bond by U.S. Magistrate Judge Robin Rosenbaum, who ruled that due to his ability to forge documents, he was considered a flight risk.[75] Although his arraignment plea was not guilty, Rothstein cooperated with the Government and reversed his plea to guilty of five federal crimes on January 27, 2010. He was sentenced to 50 years, despite the prosecution asking for 40 years.[76]In 2010 Trevor Cook of Minnesota plead guilty and began serving a 25 year federal prison sentence in connection with the Oxford Group which reportedly took in $194 million. Bo Beckman still has charges pending in connection with the scheme.[77][78][79][80]In early 2010, it was reported that Tzvi Erez from Toronto had scammed 76 creditors out of a combined $27 million. He created an illegitimate print business called E Graphix, and convinced investors to give him large loans in order to carry out fictional printing orders. He was charged with fraud and forgery by Toronto police, but was not convicted because the Canadian courts lacked adequate trial time to give him a trial.[81][82]On May 20, 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a federal case against Edward A. Allen and David L. Olson, two former brokers of World Financial Group / World Group Securities, accusing them of having raised approximately $14.8 million through the offer and sale of promissory notes as part of an illegal Ponzi scheme in the States of Ohio and Florida between September 2005 and December 2008.[83]On August 29, 2011, James Davis Risher, a twice convicted securities felon, pleaded guilty in Federal Court to his role in operating a $21 million Ponzi scheme from 2007 to 2010, targeting elderly and unsophisticated investors. His victims were spread out across eight US states and Canada, although most were concentrated near Lakeland, Florida. Operating through multiple US banks and at least two FINRA-registered investment firms, Risher was able to attract approximately $21 million from unsuspecting investors to be managed in his "private equity funds". Although millions did find their way to the FINRA-registered brokerages through which he advertised he would manage, many millions more were funneled through his bank accounts and used to purchase real estate, vehicles, artwork, and other effects. The FBI, the SEC, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the IRS, Florida's Office of Financial Regulation, and the US Postal Inspection Service began to collaborate on an investigation into the matter sometime in 2010, leading to Risher's May 31, 2011, apprehension and subsequent arrest.[84][85][86][87] In December 2011, a federal judge sentenced the 61 year old Risher to 20 years in prison, years of supervised probation upon his release, and ordered him to repay the victims $17,756,186 in restitution.In December 2011, film exhibitor Norman Adie pleaded guilty in U.S. Federal Court to running a Ponzi scheme in New York and Pennsylvania.[88]On December 15, 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a federal case against father and son Allen and Wendell Jacobson, of Fountain Green, Utah as well as the company that the two were said to be running, Management Solutions, claiming that it was a $220 million Ponzi operation that was targeting the members of the LDS Church. A freeze order was placed upon their assets.[89][90]On August 17, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a federal case against defendants Paul Burks and Zeek Rewards, based out of North Carolina. Paul Burks ran the entity of Zeek Rewards, a fraudulent investment opportunity that promised investors returns as high as 1.5% per day by sharing in the profits of Zeekler, a penny auction. Investors were encouraged to recruit new members to increase their returns. New investors had to pay a monthly "subscription" of up to $99/month and an initial investment of up to $10,000. The higher the initial investment, the higher the returns appeared. The Zeekler entity was an online penny auction that served as a front for the Zeek Rewards entity. Investors in the Zeek Rewards scheme were promised payouts from the profits made on Zeekler by recruiting new members and giving out "bids" that customers would use on the penny auction. While the Zeekler website did bring in revenue, it was only about 1% of what investors believed was being brought into the Zeek Rewards company. The vast majority of dispersed funds were paid out from newly recruited investors. It is believed that the ponzi scheme was a $600M enterprise and the number of affected investors was 1 million when the SEC filed suit. This made Zeek Rewards the largest ponzi scheme in history by number of affected investors, even though numerous other ponzi schemes have had larger enterprise values. Paul Burks paid $4M to the SEC and agreed to cooperate. It remains unknown how much, if any, of the funds lost in the scheme will be returned to affected investors, as of August 2012. [91][92][93]On September 5, 2012, the Economic Offences Wing of the TamilNadu Police arrested M S Guru, the mastermind of a 'contract emu farming' scheme for financial fraud and cheating over 12,000 investors. The filed cases alone amount to over $28 million.[94]On October 1, 2012, A joint raiding operation was conducted on Genneva Malaysia Sdn Bhd and its affiliates by the Royal Malaysian Police, Ministry of Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism, Companies Commission of Malaysia and Bank Negara Malaysia. Singapores Commercial Affairs Department has also conducted a similar operation against Genneva Pte. Ltd. in Singapore. Estimation of RM10 billion (close to USD 330 millions) filed cases. [95]Sarah Howe, who in 1880 opened up a "Ladies Deposit" in Boston promising eight percent interest, although she had no method of making profits. This unique scheme was billed as "for women only". Howe was arrested on October 18, 1880 by New York City Police and sentenced to three years in prison.[1]On March 22, 2000, four people were indicted in the Northern District of Ohio, on charges including conspiracy to commit and committing mail and wire fraud. A company with which the defendants were affiliated allegedly collected more than $26 million from "investors" without selling any product or service, and paid older investors with the proceeds of the money collected from the newer investors.[96]In late 2003, a scheme by Bill Hickman, Sr., and his son, Bill Jr., was shut down. He had been selling unregistered securities that promised yields of up to 20 percent; more than $8 million was defrauded from dozens of residents of Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, along with investors from as far away as California.[97] Hickman Sr. was sentenced to 8 years in state prison and Hickman Jr. to five years.In December 2004, Mark Drucker pleaded guilty to a Ponzi scheme in which he told investors that he would use their funds to buy and sell securities through a brokerage account. He claimed that he was making significant profits on his day trades and that he had opportunities to invest in select IPOs that were likely to turn a substantial profit in a short period of time, and promised guaranteed returns of up to fifty (50%) percent in 90 days or less. In less than two years of trading, Drucker actually lost more than $850,000 in day trading and had no special access to IPOs. He paid out more than $3.6 million to investors while taking in $6.3 million.[98][99]In June 2005, in Los Angeles, California, John C. Jeffers was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison and ordered to pay $26 million in restitution to more than 80 victims. Jeffers and his confederate John Minderhout ran what they said was a high-yield investment program they called the "Short Term Financing Transaction". The funds were collected from investors around the world from 1996 through 2000. Some investors were told that proceeds would be used to finance humanitarian projects around the globe, such as low-cost housing for the poor in developing nations. Jeffers sent letters to some victims that falsely claimed the program had been licensed by the Federal Reserve and the program had a relationship with the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury. Jeffers and Minderhout promised investors profits of up to 4,000 percent. Most of the money collected in the scheme went to Jeffers to pay commissions to salespeople, to make payments to investors to keep the scheme going, and to pay his own personal expenses.[100]In February 2006, Edmundo Rubi pleaded guilty to bilking hundreds of middle and low-income investors out of more than $24 million between 1999 and 2001, when he fled the U.S. after becoming aware that he was under suspicion. The investors in the scheme, called "Knight Express", were told that their funds would be used to purchase and resell Federal Reserve notes, and were promised a six percent monthly return. Most of those bilked were part of the Filipino community in San Diego.[101]On May 10, 2006, Spanish police arrested nine people associated with Forum Filatelico and Afinsa Bienes Tangibles in an apparent Ponzi scheme that affected 250,000 investors from 1998 to 2001. Investors were promised huge returns from investments in a stamp fund.[102]On September 15, 2010, Nevin Shapiro pleaded guilty to a 20052009 Ponzi scheme in a Newark, New Jersey court. The scheme brought in approximately $880 million. Headquartered in Miami, the scheme was based on an import/export grocery business but was diverting investments to attract new investors. Among the items seized as a result of his plea were a $5 million Miami mansion and a yacht. He was known as "Lil Luke" because of his relationship with the Miami Hurricanes football team. This was a tribute to Luther Campbell, a famous former Hurricanes booster. On August 16, 2011, in a story broken by Yahoo! Sports, Shapiro stated that his support of the team included cash, entertainment, prostitutes, and gifts, all against NCAA rules.

Leverage is an American television drama series on TNT that premiered in December 2008.[1] The series is produced by director/executive producer Dean Devlin's production company Electric Entertainment. Leverage follows a five-person team: a thief, a grifter, a hacker, and a retrieval specialist, led by former insurance investigator Nathan Ford, who use their skills to fight corporate and governmental injustices inflicted on ordinary citizens.Season 1 consists of thirteen episodes, which writers John Rogers and Chris Downey and producer Dean Devlin intended to be a complete story should the series not be renewed. Season 2, for which production moved from Los Angeles to Portland, Oregon,[2] ran in two parts: a nine-episode summer season that premiered on July 15, 2009, followed by a further six episodes the following winter. Leverage moved to Sunday for Season 3, which began June 20, 2010.[3]Leverage was renewed for a fourth season in July 2010.[4] It premiered on June 26, 2011,[5] and ran for 18 episodes, ten in the summer and eight in the winter. The continuation of Season 4 began on Sunday November 27, 2011, at 9pm EST on TNT.[6]On August 12, 2011, Leverage was renewed for a fifth season,[7] to be both filmed and set in Portland, Oregon.[8] Season 5 premiered July 15, 2012.[9]Nathan Ford is a former insurance investigator with an intricate knowledge of scams. He and his team act as modern-day Robin Hoods, staging elaborate cons for clients victimized by an individual or corporation with the wealth and influence to avoid reprisal within the legal system.The team comes together when Victor Dubenich, a wealthy aerospace executive, persuades Ford to lead a team of talented criminals to steal back aeronautical plans allegedly stolen from him by a competitor. After a successful heist, Dubenich double-crosses them, withdrawing their payment and attempting to blow them up in an abandoned warehouse. In retaliation, the group decides to run a con on Victor, eventually exposing his corruption and implicating him in a bribery attempt, which leads to his being arrested by the FBI. When the con is complete, rather than retire, they decide to keep working for the thrill each gets doing the work they are best at, and the added bonus of how effective they are as part of an elite team. Ford's condition for continuing is that he is allowed to select their jobs, steering them from crimes engaged in for pure profit to jobs undertaken to benefit those with a genuine need who cannot use the legal system or other "legitimate" methods to redress their grievances. Underpinning the main plot are two relationships: Nate and Sophie, whose complicated romantic relationship dates back to his days as an insurance investigator, and Parker and Hardison, whose nascent romance plays out tentatively, as they learn how to build a relationship.The team sets up headquarters in Los Angeles, operating as Leverage Consulting & Associates, and for a time operate free of scrutiny until the arrival of Nate's former competitor, James Sterling. With Sterling determined to take them down, they pull their most daring heist by stealing a maquette from Nate's former boss, Ian Blackpoole. Nate's revenge comes at a cost, and the team must disband for six months. It re-forms in Boston, Nate's hometown, where they resume their activities, still followed by Sterling. Season two ends with the team still intact but physically separated from Ford, who surrenders to Sterling and the FBI rather than allow the team to be arrested.As season three begins, Ford is in prison, while the team attempts to find a way to get him out, until fate intervenes in the form of a mysterious Italian woman who aids in Nate's escape. She blackmails the team into taking down infamous and untouchable criminal figure Damien Moreau. By season's end, the team finally brings down Moreau's empire, and he is left imprisoned in San Lorenzo, a fictional European nation he once controlled until the team ousted the puppet regime leader.Season four opens only days after their return from San Lorenzo, the team discovering that someone has been bugging their headquarters. They assume one of the many influential people they've brought down is now out for payback. Nate discovers that its really the work of a wealthy businessman named Jack Latimer. Latimer has been tracking the team's movements since their formation in Chicago, and has found a way to profit off their good deeds. With every major company they bring down, he invests in their competitors and makes a fortune, having built a multibillion-dollar empire in the short span of their operations; now he offers to give the team intel on the evildoings of other major corporations, if they alert him in advance and give him the chance to profit on each company's downfall. Nate, however, does not trust Latimer and refuses to associate himself and his team with Latimer, and his suspicions prove to be justified when it is revealed that Latimer is secretly working with Victor Dubenich (the team's first victim), who is out to not only rebuild his fortune but also destroy the team.Season Five opens with the team having moved to Portland, Oregon and setting up shop in a microbrewery.Most episodes follow a set story structure: After meeting the client, the Leverage team researches the villains to find a weakness to exploit as part of their con. Each con, either as originally planned or as complications develop, typically requires the specialized skills of all the members of the group. Towards the end of each episode, the villains seem to get the upper hand, only to be outwitted by the Leverage team. Because most of the narrative has seemed to follow the Leverage team's point of view, the audience is momentarily uninformed as to exactly how the Leverage team has succeeded in their con. A flashback then reveals how a seeming complication was either anticipated by the Leverage team, or utilized in a clever improvisation. These flashbacks, which feature in every episode, sometimes reveal only in retrospect that an earlier scene was actually a clue to the Leverage team's plan. More often, however, the flashbacks reveal new information the viewer has not been privy to. This formula is followed by every episode in seasons one, two, and three. Each season ends with a two-part season finale which involves a two-part, multi-stage con designed to bring down a major adversary, such as an international crime financier in season three, with an ending that advances the team's story into the new season.Leverage is shot using Red One video cameras. Extensive use of Steadicam helps the audience participate in the scene. All of the dailies are shipped on hard drives to Electric Entertainment in Hollywood, California.[11] Shooting, editing, and all post-production work are done digitally, using no physical film or videotape at any point in the process. Leverage was originally edited in Apple's Final Cut Studio Pro 7, but has used Final Cut Pro X in the most recent seasons.[12][11]Shooting is in 4096 x 2304 at 24 frame/s, though resolution is reduced in post production to 1080p.Thirteen episodes were commissioned for the first season.[13] The show's pilot was filmed on-location in Chicago, with the remainder of the first season set and filmed in Los Angeles. Since the second season, the show has been primarily set in Boston, but filmed in Portland, Oregon whereas of Season 5 the team has moved operations. Executive producer Dean Devlin has announced that the fifth season will not only be shot in Portland, but will be set there as well.[14]The series premiered on December 7, 2008 on TNT in the United States.In the United Kingdom the series aired on Bravo where it premiered on January 20, 2010; when Bravo closed down, it was picked up by the FXUK.[15][16]The series started broadcasting January 7, 2009 on W Channel in Australia.[citation needed]ION TV announced that Leverage will become part of their 2012 broadcast in syndication. The series debuted on the network on July 1, 2012.[17] The show is broadcast in evening marathons on Wednesday.[18]In Live + 7 data, Leverage averaged 4.0 million viewers per episode in the first season, 4.5 million viewers per episode in the second season,[19] and 4.5 million viewers per episode in the third season.[20]The series ranks as ad-supported cable's #1 entertainment program in the Tuesday 10 p.m. (ET/PT) time slot among viewers, households and adults 2554. The December 7, 2008 premiere was watched by 5.6 million viewers and scored TNT's best original series telecast ever in delivery of adults 1849 during the regular broadcast season.

The first six episodes scored strong growth when comparing Live to Live + 7 numbers, with total viewership rising 33% to 4.1 million and adults 1849 rising 42% to 1.9 million.Data from TNT indicates that a large percentage of viewers recorded the second season finale of Leverage for later viewing. The Live + 7 viewership of 4.2 million viewers was 70 percent greater than the Live data for the same episode. In addition, for the season, Live +7 viewership was 58 percent greater than Live viewership.[19]The premiere of Leverage on June 20, 2010 averaged approximately 3.0 million viewers the two episodes, and maintained a 1.0 rating for Adults 1849.[21]The June 26, 2011 premiere episode was viewed by 3.42 million viewers (10% more than the third season premiere)[22] while the January 15, 2012 season finale was viewed by 3.9 million viewers.[23]CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) released the first three seasons of Leverage on DVD in the United States (Region 1).

The son of South Boston numbers runner Jimmy Ford,[10] Nate originally intended to become a Catholic priest prior to becoming an insurance investigator. While Ford was working for IYS, Blackpoole decided on a policy of denying every medical treatment especially those experimental(Blackpoole claimed the policy was implemented to cut costs, but in fact to turn a bigger profit), his young son Sam became fatally ill and IYS refused to pay for an experimental procedure, resulting in his death. The aftermath led to Nate's divorce from his wife Maggie, his subsequent dismissal from the company and his descent into alcoholism. Ford swore vengeance on Blackpoole and IYS which would come to pass years later. After meeting the team for the first time and running a con against their first mark, instead of disbanding as intended, Nate is asked to continue working with them and is given the privilege of leading the team and selecting what clients the team will help. A skilled planner, Nate draws on his experience as an insurance investigator to anticipate the moves of his team's marks. Nate is at first very affable, but is unwilling to discuss his own problems with friends or others. His tendency to change objectives in the middle of a job, his alcoholism, and his often-tenuous relationship with his team has on occasion put the client and the team at risk. Since moving to Portland, he and Sophie are now an established couple, but he is currently working on a project with Hardison's help which is being kept secret from the other team members.Gina Bellman as Sophie Devereaux ("The Grifter"): British actress and accomplished grifter with a taste for art theft. Multi-lingual and particularly adept at the use of accents, Sophie is seen to portray many characters in various cons, usually making direct contact with a mark to draw them into the con. Sophie has a collection of aliases, which includes "Sophie Devereaux", but her real name remains unknown. Comically, her attempts to make a career as an actress lead to nothing but failure, as she proves woefully untalented and over-the-top onstage. It is only during a con when she can disappear effortlessly into a character, where ironically she can actually act well if she is pretending to be an actress. She has a long history with Nate, dating back at least ten years to when he pursued her with IYS as an art thief. At some point, they recognized an attraction to one another, leaving Sophie alternately frustrated, angry, and disappointed. They have on occasion tried to further the relationship, but for various reasons one or the other resisted; however, as of the beginning of Season 5 she and Nate are now an established couple.Aldis Hodge as Alec Hardison ("The Hacker"): The team's computer specialist and hacker. He is a self-proclaimed geek and science fiction fan, with an easy going manner and dry, unusual wit. Hardison was raised by a foster parent, an older woman he refers to as "Nana". Hardison can hack into most forms of electronics and is rarely caught. Hardison designed and assembled the computer and television systems in the team's headquarters, and is responsible for the two-way earpieces used by the team on each episode. He is also very attached to his electronics (and in particular his van) and shown to become very depressed when the con takes a turn for the worse and requires they destroy his electronics to make their escape. Hardison and Parker have a developing romantic relationship but it is fraught with personal complications.Christian Kane as Eliot Spencer ("The Hitter"): The team's highly skilled martial artist, weapons expert and self-described "retrieval expert". A former soldier in the United States Army, his role in cons is often to play small roles while protecting the team, often leading him into hand-to-hand combat that draws on his martial arts skills. Eliot once worked for crime financier Damien Moreau, and has a long history as a hired gun and bodyguard, then a retrieval specialist. Eliot has proficiency with firearms, but dislikes guns. While merely presumed as the muscleman, he demonstrates a subtle intelligence in conversation, often taking advantage of the underestimations of others and later in the series performs as a grifter along with Sophie. In contrast to the other characters Eliot prefers to keep his romantic life private, as well as much of his background. In the course of the series, he has displayed an extraordinary talent for cooking, and is now in charge of the kitchen of the microbrewery in Portland where the team has set up headquarters (despite clashes on the subject with Hardison).Beth Riesgraf as Parker ("The Thief"): An expert thief, cat-burglar, pickpocket and safe-cracker. The product of an abusive childhood spent in several foster homes, Parker is socially awkward and relates poorly to most people but has come to regard the other members of the team as her family. Sophie (and in Season 5 Elliot) has attempted to improve gaps in her social skills on numerous occasions with limited success. Parker also has affection for Hardison, but finds it hard to convey what she feels when confronted by others. While emotionally impulsive, she can demonstrate great physical self-control in her work using acrobatics, strength and concentration to her advantage. Her obsessive focus on theft is to the point that her safehouse is filled with gear and rappelling equipment to help her in various jobs, and during one con, she was put through a rehab to address it. Parker was trained at a young age by expert thief (and recurring character) Archie Leach, who found her proficient with the physical demands of burglary as well as safe-cracking and lock-picking, skills she uses in many of the cons. In Season 5's "The Broken Wing Job", she proves that she can handle problems on her own while the other team members are away.Mark A. Sheppard as James Sterling: Originally Nate's colleague and rival at IYS, now an Interpol agent. Sterling learns of Nate's new life and begins to follow him, first thinking that Nate wants his job at IYS and later to bring the team to justice. Nate soon realizes Sterling is on his trail, but foils his efforts to dismantle the team's cons. In time, a theft leads Sterling to work with the team on a con, the outcome of which leads to his being offered a position with Interpol. The two remain friendly adversaries however (with the rest of the team and Tara passionately hating him), and Sterling has on several occasions allowed Nate to continue to remain untouched in exchange for Nate and his group helping him catch bad guys. As of Season 5's "The Frame Up Job", he has become the head of a special Interpol art theft/forgery detail (which he created).Jeri Ryan as Tara Cole: A self-assured grifter sent by Sophie to temporarily replace her while she is in Europe taking some personal time. Easily able to adapt to the team's method, she is nonetheless slow to be accepted by the team. Tara is a profit-seeking con who seeks a cut of most of their jobs, but over time learns to understand their not-for-profit motives.Kari Matchett as Maggie Collins: Nate's ex-wife, an art expert who re-enters his life while working with IYS Chair Ian Blackpoole. Although she is no longer in love with him, Maggie still cares for Nate. However, she cannot live with his drinking, which led her to divorce him. She is unaware of IYS's role in her son's death, but learns the whole story as she's drawn into one of Nate's cons, allowing them to come to terms with his death and begin to rebuild their relationship. She demonstrates a flair for Nate's new work, and ends up helping the team complete a con; later the team comes to her rescue when she is falsely accused of theft. She returns to help the team in the fourth season finale, and by then has developed a friendship with Sophie.Rick Overton and Gerald Downey as FBI Special Agents Taggert and McSweeten: Taggert and McSweeten have (unwittingly) worked with Leverage Consulting & Associates on at least four occasions, believing Hardison and Parker to be fellow FBI agents.
