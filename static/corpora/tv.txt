The Big Bang Theory is an American sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, both of whom serve as executive producers on the show, along with Steven Molaro. All three also serve as head writers. It premiered on CBS on September 24, 2007.[5]The show is centered on five characters: roommates Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, two physicists employed at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech); Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's equally geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Rajesh Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four guys is contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.[6][7] Over time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles: Leslie Winkle, a physicist colleague at Caltech and, at different times, a lover of both Leonard and Howard; Bernadette Rostenkowski, Howard's fiance (later his wife), a microbiologist and former part-time waitress alongside Penny; Stuart Bloom, the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit, and neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler, who joins the group after surreptitiously being matched to Sheldon on a dating website.The show, which is filmed in front of a live audience, is produced by Warner Bros. Television and Chuck Lorre Productions.[8] In August 2009, the sitcom won the best comedy series TCA award and Jim Parsons (Sheldon) won the award for individual achievement in comedy.[9] In 2010, the show won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy, while Parsons won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.[10] On January 16, 2011, Parsons was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series Comedy or Musical, an award that was presented by co-star Kaley Cuoco. On September 18, 2011, Parsons was again awarded an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy Series.When the third season premiered on September 21, 2009, The Big Bang Theory ranked as CBS's highest-rated show of that evening in the adults 1849 demographic (4.6/10) along with a then-series-high 12.83million viewers.[11] CBS moved the show to Thursdays at 8:00 ET for the 20102011 schedule. On January 12, 2011, CBS announced that the show had been renewed for an additional three years, extending it through the 20132014 season.[12]The series' sixth season premiered on September 27, 2012.[13]The show's initial pilot, developed for the 200607 television season, was substantially different from its current form. The only characters from the initial pilot that were kept for the reshot pilot for the series were Leonard and Sheldon (portrayed by Johnny Galecki and Jim Parsons respectively and named after Sheldon Leonard).[14] The cast was rounded off by two female leads: Canadian actress Amanda Walsh as Katie, "a street-hardened, tough-as-nails, woman with a vulnerable interior" who the boys meet after she breaks up with her boyfriend and invite to live in their apartment (Katie was replaced by Penny in the second pilot);[15][16] and Iris Bahr as Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend of the boys who was threatened by Katie's presence. The initial pilot used Thomas Dolby's hit "She Blinded Me with Science" as theme music.The series was not picked up, but the creators were given an opportunity to retool the show and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. The original unaired pilot has never been officially released, but it has circulated on the Internet. On the evolution of the show, Lorre said "We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim. We rewrote the thing entirely, and then we were blessed with Kaley and Simon and Kunal." As to whether the world will ever see that original pilot, maybe on a DVD, Lorre said "Wow that would be something, we will see. Show your failures..."[17]The first and second pilots of The Big Bang Theory were directed by James Burrows, who did not continue with the show. The reworked second pilot led to a 13-episode order by CBS on May 14, 2007.[18] Prior to its airing on CBS, the pilot episode was distributed on iTunes free of charge. The show premiered September 24, 2007, and was picked up for a full 22-episode season on October 19, 2007.[19] However, production was halted on November 6, 2007 due to the Writers Guild of America strike. The series returned on March 17, 2008 in an earlier time slot[20] and ultimately only 17 episodes were produced.[21][22] After the strike ended, the show was picked up for a second season airing in the 20082009 season, premiering in the same time slot on September 22, 2008.[23] With increasing ratings, the show received a two-year renewal through the 201011 season.[24][25] Since then, the show has been picked up for three more seasons.[26]David Saltzberg, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, checks scripts and provides dialogue, mathematics equations, and diagrams used as props.[6] According to executive producer/co-creator Bill Prady, "We're working on giving Sheldon an actual problem that he's going to be working on throughout the [first] season so there's actual progress to the boards ... We worked hard to get all the science right."[7]Several of the actors in The Big Bang Theory worked together previously on Roseanne including Johnny Galecki, Sara Gilbert, and Laurie Metcalf (who plays Sheldon's mother, Mary Cooper). Additionally, Lorre was a writer on the series for several seasons.The Canadian alternative rock band Barenaked Ladies wrote and recorded the show's theme song, which describes the history and formation of the universe and the Earth. Ed Robertson, lead singer and guitarist in the band, was asked by Lorre and Prady to write a theme song for the show. Having been asked to write songs for other films and shows only to have them rejected in favor of another artist's, Robertson agreed to write a theme only after learning that he was the sole writer that Lorre and Prady had asked. He drew inspiration from Simon Singh's book, Big Bang, which he had coincidentally just finished reading.[27][28]On October 9, 2007, a full-length (1 minute and 45 seconds) version of the song was released commercially.[29]The season finale of season 5 had Howard Wolowitz go to the International Space Station (ISS) on board a Soyuz rocket, and season 6 had Wolowitz working in the ISS. Thanks to technical consulting from Astronaut Mike Massimino, who also played himself on the show, the production crew was able to put together a set that realistically depicts the Soyuz capsule as well as the ISS. The Soyuz capsule was constructed based on photos from NASA, a museum in Kansas for dimensions, and scavenged parts from an aerospace junkyard in Los Angeles. A small 20-foot (6.1m) portion of a chamber that is a model of the ISS was rented and used as the set for the ISS. "Unique camera angles and creative framing" were used to make the set look larger.To simulate weightlessness, the production crew decided to use "long skinny platforms" to support the actors from below, rather than use tethers to suspend from above. The actors were required to act out "motions of microgravity" in order to create "theatrical authenticity".[30]For the first three seasons, Galecki, Parsons and Kaley Cuoco, the three main stars of the show, received at most $60,000 per episode. The salary for the three went up to $200,000 per episode for the fourth season. According to their contracts, their per-episode pay will go up an additional $50,000 in each of the following three seasons, culminating in $350,000 per episode in the seventh season.[31][32]These actors have been credited in all episodes of the series:These actors were first credited as guest stars and later promoted to main cast. However, even after promotion, they are only credited in episodes in which they appear:Much of the show focuses on science, particularly physics. The four main male characters are employed at Caltech and have science-related occupations. The characters frequently banter about scientific theories or news (notably around the start of the show), and make science-related jokes.Science has also interfered with the characters' romantic lives. Leslie broke up with Leonard when he sided with Sheldon in his support for string theory rather than her support for loop quantum gravity.[48] When Leonard joined Sheldon, Raj, and Howard on a three-month Arctic research trip, it separated Leonard and Penny at a time their relationship was budding. When Bernadette took an interest in Leonard's work, it made both Penny and Howard jealous and resulted in Howard confronting Leonard, and Penny asking Sheldon to teach her physics.[49] Sheldon and Amy also briefly ended their relationship after an argument over which of their fields was superior to the other's.[50]David Saltzberg, who has a Ph.D. in physics, has served as science consultant for the show for five seasons. While Salzberg knows physics, he sometimes needs assistance from Mayim Bialik, who has a Ph.D. in neuroscience. Salzberg sees early versions of scripts which need scientific information added to them, and he also points out where the writers, despite their knowledge of science, have made a mistake. He is usually not needed in a taping unless a lot of science, and especially the whiteboard, is involved.[51]The four main male characters are all avid sci-fi, fantasy, and comic book fans and memorabilia collectors.Star Trek in particular is frequently referenced and Sheldon identifies strongly with the character of Spock; when he is given a used napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy as a Christmas gift from Penny he is overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude ("I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!").[52] Star Trek: The Original Series cast member George Takei has made a cameo, and Leonard Nimoy made a cameo as the voice of Sheldon's vintage Mr. Spock action figure (both cameos were in dream sequences). Star Trek: The Next Generation cast members Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton have had cameos as themselves,[53][54] while Wil Wheaton has a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself. All four male characters can speak Klingon to varying degreesthe opening of the episode "The Panty Piata Polarization" shows them playing "Klingon Boggle". During the "The Launch Acceleration" episode, Amy and Sheldon were seen playing doctor with Amy dressed in a Star Trek medical uniform.[55]In addition to Star Trek, the group are also fans of Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica and Doctor Who; numerous quotes from Star Wars are made and references to Battlestar Galactica can be seen in some episodes. In season two, Raj once likens Sheldon to C-3PO,[56] an intelligent, yet semi-annoying protocol droid in the Star Wars series. In episode 5 of season 2, Sheldon wants to return a set of white Star Wars sheets to Pottery Barn as they are too exciting for sleeping in.[57] In 2009, Katee Sackhoff of Battlestar Galactica appeared as herself in "The Vengeance Formulation" episode as Howard's fantasy dream girl. She appears again in season 4, in the same role. Leonard likes Babylon 5, but Sheldon refuses to watch it, calling it derivative.[58][note 1] Sheldon also expresses a great liking of Joss Whedon's Firefly, as he is shown to be quite upset with the Fox network for cancelling it.[note 1]The four males are also fans of non-scientific fantasy and make references to The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter novels and movies. Howard can speak Sindarin, one of the two Elvish languages from The Lord of the Rings. In one episode, they find a prop of the One Ring and they all fight over who gets to keep it. Leonard, Sheldon, Raj, and Howard all have a Frodo Baggins costume and Raj once bought what he thought was a "hand crafted" Harry Potter wand on ebay.Wednesday night is the group's designated "comic book night",[59] the store in question being run by fellow geek and recurring character Stuart. On a number of occasions, the group members have dressed up as pop culture characters, including The Flash, Aquaman, Frodo Baggins, Superman, Batman, Spock, The Doctor, Green Lantern, and Thor (albeit as the original Norse god and not the Marvel Comics character).[60] As a consequence of losing a bet to Stuart, the group members are forced to visit the comic book store dressed as Catwoman, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and Supergirl.[61] Sheldon often wears t-shirts depicting Batman, Superman, Flash, Greatest American Hero, or Green Lantern. DC Comics announced that, to promote its comics, the company will sponsor Sheldon wearing Green Lantern t-shirts.[62]The characters are also fans of the Indiana Jones series, and willing to spend several hours in line outside of a theater to watch a special screening of Raiders of the Lost Ark with 21 seconds of new footage.[63]One of the recurring topics is the relationship between Leonard and Penny. Leonard becomes attracted to Penny within seconds of seeing her in the pilot episode. The first season frequently featured Leonard's attraction to Penny as a basis for humor. Leonard and Penny go on a date that started the final episode of the first season and ended at the start of the second season; however, Penny quickly breaks up with Leonard because she is afraid that her educational attainments aren't good enough for Leonard and that he may become bored in "The Bad Fish Paradigm" episode. Her excuse for breaking with Leonard was when he showed her some brochures from a local community college and she took it as a knock against her education level and that she felt that he would only date a girl with a college education.They both date other people throughout the second season, but clearly still have feelings for each other as when Penny admits this to herself in "The Monopolar Expedition". When Leonard returns from a 3-month expedition to the North Pole in the season 3 premiere, they commence a relationship which lasts for most of the season until Leonard tells Penny that he loves her and she realizes she cannot say it back, and she reluctantly breaks up with him after Wil Wheaton meddles with their relationship in order to beat Sheldon at bowling per "The Wheaton Recurrence".Again, both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. Penny has shown regret towards her decision to break up with Leonard by admitting to Raj that she misses Leonard in "The Roommate Transmogrification". She also exhibits jealousy towards Priya, especially after Priya demands Leonard stay away from her as in "The Prestidigitation Approximation". After dating Leonard, Penny also has negative reactions to her male dates who are not very intelligent after dating Zack in "The Lunar Excitation".Eventually, as the episodes rolled on, Leonard became more and more interested in Priya. However she seemed to become less and less interested in Leonard as they went on dating.[episodeneeded] Later in the season, in "The Roommate Transmogrification" episode, Leonard is at Raj's apartment, making out with Priya, when her parents call from India, and she has Leonard leave the room as she answers the call. Unknowing of Leonard's presence or his secret relationship with Priya, her parents state that they will be so happy when Priya moves back to India. Leonard comes in, shouting out that he is shocked she is moving back to India, and assumes it means he and Priya are breaking up. Leonard goes home to his apartment, where Raj has been sleeping because of Leonard staying at Raj's apartment. Penny and Raj, while enjoying a friendly evening, got drunk and ended up in bed. Leonard assumes the worst when they emerge from his room, only to learn the truth later, that nothing happened.In season five in "The Infestation Hypothesis", Leonard resumes his relationship with Priya online. It seems to work for Leonard, but he is conflicted when he meets Alice, a girl who is really into him, at the comic book store. Leonard decides he must be faithful to Priya, ending things with Alice. Leonard confesses to Priya about going out with Alice, only to discover that Priya has slept with an ex-boyfriend, and they break up in "The Good Guy Fluctuation".Penny is still single and dating, though when drunk has confessed that she regrets breaking up with Leonard, as in "The Roommate Transmogrification". In "The Ornithophobia Diffusion", Leonard and Penny go to the movies as friends. Leonard decides that since they are no longer dating he can be honest and does not have to pay for everything or do whatever Penny wants to make Penny like him and have sex with him. The two bicker all evening and sabotage each other's attempts to chat up people in the bar. Penny decides that she likes the new, more assertive Leonard. Leonard sees this as another opportunity to grovel and try to get Penny to sleep with him, so she leaves.On the spur of the moment in "The Recombination Hypothesis", Leonard asks Penny out on a date after he imagined what getting back with her might be like. Their real date ends successfully, and they agree to try to renew their relationship slowly in "The Beta Test Initiation". They share a kiss. During her renewed relationship with Leonard she has dismissed comments about him ever leaving or dumping her or about worrying about his unfaithfulness around other women and strippers as in the episode "The Stag Convergence". After Penny suggested having sex in "The Launch Acceleration", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. They later meet and Penny has the courage to tell him "no" and not break up with him as she did two years previously when he told her that he loved her in "The Wheaton Recurrence". In the sixth season episode, "The 43 Peculiarity", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him.Showrunner Bill Prady has hinted that Leonard and Penny's relationship may get "rocky" in season six. Prady explained that the series' on-again-off-again couple will continue to face "challenges", such as their conflicting views about when to "settle down". "What we've always said about Penny and Leonard is they met each other at the wrong time in their lives," he told E!. "Leonard is ready to settle down and Penny isn't yet and it will make things rocky for a while. I think that until she grows up a little bit  and I don't mean emotionally, I mean chronologically  I think they have challenges [ahead]."[citation needed]A new recurring subject starting at the end of the third season is the status of the relationship of Sheldon and Amy Farrah Fowler, Ph.D., a neurobiologist. Raj and Howard found her as a possible match for Sheldon through an internet dating service (without Sheldon's knowledge) in "The Lunar Excitation". By Sheldon's own admission, she is most like him by any standard to his mother in "The Zazzy Substitution". Like him, she has previously avoided relationships (whether romantic or otherwise is unclear), and only participated in the online dating herself to fulfill an agreement with her mother that she date at least once a year (in exchange, her mother does not discuss Amy's lack of a love life, plus she gains use of her mother's George Foreman Grill) as told to Penny on her date with Sheldon during "The Robotic Manipulation".During the four months of their relationship (taking place off-screen between seasons 3 and 4), they communicated on a daily basis via text messages, email and Twitter, but never saw each other in person per "The Robotic Manipulation". Sheldon, however, did not consider Amy his girlfriend. Penny later suggests that they should go on a date and ends up driving them and having dinner with them in "The Robotic Manipulation." Penny occasionally refers to Sheldon and Amy collectively as "Shamy" as in "The Shiny Trinket Maneuver".In "The Agreement Dissection", Amy, Penny, and Bernadette decide to take Sheldon dancing. Sheldon dances only with Amy, which he does not mind. He later follows Amy back to her apartment. They talk for a few minutes before she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon just says "Fascinating." This is a catalyst for later events[citation needed] and clash of personalities in the relationship of the more scientific, masculine Sheldon, and the more socially open, feminine, and annoyed Amy.In "The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition", after Amy agrees to go on a date with Stuart the comic book store owner, Sheldon asks Amy to be his girlfriend interrupting her date with Stuart with the stipulation that no other changes occur in their current relationship. The same night and episode, he draws up "The Relationship Agreement" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and her as his girlfriend (similar to his "Roommate Agreement" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having a lawyer read through it.After Penny and Bernadette go wedding shopping without Amy in "The Isolation Permutation", Sheldon comforts a depressed Amy by cuddling with her on her couch; however, Amy first suggests that they have coitus.In the episode "The Launch Acceleration", Amy says shed like to do an experiment using her neurobiology bag of tricks to increase Sheldons feelings toward her. Sheldon is skeptical, but goes with it. Amy says shed like to put on some romantic dinner music, and ends up putting on the Super Mario Bros. theme song. Sheldon catches on, and calls Amy out on the fact that shes trying to engage his feelings of the happiest times of his life as he starts to hum along. This is further reinforced when she offers Sheldon his favorite drink, Strawberry Quik. She also prepared "spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up" for dinner, which is Sheldon's favorite since his mother used to make it for him. Sheldon is thrilled, and says they should do this more often  instantly realizing hes been caught in Amy's "trap" as Amy stands next to him with a big smile. At the end of the episode, they were playing doctor "Star Trek style" (Amy dressed in Star Trek attire). Amys actions seem to work on Sheldon, who isnt happy about it but makes no attempt to stop her.In the final fifth season episode "The Countdown Reflection", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. Amy glances over at him looking quite surprised.Religion plays a minor role in the series. Sheldon was raised in a fundamentalist Christian household. He refers to his childhood as "hell" during his date in "The Robotic Manipulation", and a recurrent theme is his conflict with his devout mother, Mary, whose creationist beliefs often clash with Sheldon's understanding of evolution. In "The Lunar Excitation", Sheldon mentions his promise to Mary to attend church once a year.[64] In "The Wheaton Recurrence", after scoring a spare in bowling, Sheldon happily exclaims "Thank you, Jesus! ...as my mother would say."[65] In the episode "The Zarnecki Incursion", Sheldon can be heard exclaiming "Why hast thou forsaken me, o deity whose existence I doubt?"[66] According to Raj, when Sheldon got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl, he begged the deity in which he didn't believe to kill him quickly.[note 1] Sheldon often uses "Lord" as an interjection.Howard is Jewish and Raj is of the Hindu faith, both semi-observant, apparently defying many religious customs without worry.[episodeneeded] They frequently flout dietary prohibitions and tend to give each other grief about them  In the episode "The Spaghetti Catalyst," Raj quotes from the book of Leviticus after Howard eats pork, and Howard counters with the fact that he keeps quiet when Raj eats a Whopper. Still, Raj mentions reincarnation and explains his belief in karma, stating that he believes it to be "practically Newtonian  for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction." Howard celebrates at least some Jewish holidays, yet once refused to pray to another god so he doesn't "burst into flames" and also wore tattoo sleeves instead of getting tattoos so he "still can be buried in a Jewish cemetery".[67]Neither Leonard's nor Penny's religious convictions are made clear. Leonard approaches Christianity with less skepticism than Sheldon.[episodeneeded] Penny has expressed belief in ghosts, astrology, psychics and voodoo.[68] Bernadette is Catholic, and is frequently seen wearing a necklace with a cross, while Amy is agnostic, stating in "The Lunar Excitation" that she understands the concept of a deity but is baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.[69]In many episodes, Howard has shouting conversations with his overprotective mother (voiced by Carol Ann Susi). She is dependent on Howard, as he is on her. She speaks with a Brooklyn-esque accent,[citation needed] though she comes from New Jersey.[episodeneeded] Other characters frequently do impressions of her, and Bernadette's rendition is especially accurate.[70] She always interacts with the cast from another room or on the telephone. She has never been seen, though she did appear momentarily in the overhead photo of Howard and Bernadette's wedding.[71] But still, her face was never shown.Like most shows created by Chuck Lorre, The Big Bang Theory ends by showing a vanity card written by Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros. Television closing logo. These cards are archived on Lorre's website.[72]In a 2010 issue of TV Guide, the show's opening title sequence ranked No.6 on a list of television's top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.[73]The Big Bang Theory has been highly rated since its premiere. During its fourth season, it became television's highest rated comedy, just barely beating out eight-year champ Two and a Half Men. However, in the age 1849 demographic (the show's target age range), it was the second highest rated comedy, behind ABC's Modern Family. The fifth season opened with viewing figures of over 14 million,[74] and the new season boasts the highest-rated episode for the show so far, "The 43 Peculiarity" (Season 6, Episode 8), which set a new series high with 17.63 million viewers.The show made its UK debut on Channel 4 on February 14, 2008 bringing in an average audience of 1.0million viewers. The second episode, shown the following week, also received 1.0million. For the third episode an average of 1.1million tuned in. The show is also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot E4, and brings in 400,000 viewers on average. The fifth episode received 880,000 viewers. After the first five episodes, the average number of viewers continues to hover around the 1million mark. Episode 13 was watched by 1.3million viewers and was the most watched episode.[81]In December 2008, Virgin Media made the first nine episodes of the first season available to watch on its TV Choice On Demand service, and the rest of Season 1 was made available in January 2009.As of December 5, 2009, all 23 episodes of Season 2 were also made available on Virgin Media TV Choice On Demand Service, but both seasons have now been removed.Season 3 began airing on E4 and E4 HD on December 17, 2009 at 9:00p.m. but was on hiatus between February 25, 2010 until May 6, 2010 when the final 11 episodes of the season aired.Season 4 began airing on E4 on November 4, 2010 at 9:00 p.m. It drew 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most watched program for that week.[82] E4 broke season four after 12 episodes in January 2011. Season four returned on E4 from June 30, 2011 for the remaining episodes.Season 5 began airing in 2012 at 8:00 p.m. as part of E4 Comedy Thursdays, as a lead-in to Perfect Couples. Episode 19, the highest-viewed episode of the season, attracted 1.4million viewers.[83]Season 6 premiered on E4 Thursday November 15, 2012 with 1.89 million viewers and a further 469,000 on the time shift channel, bringing the total to 2.31 Million  e4's highest viewing ratings of 2012, and the highest the channel has received since June 2010. [84]The Big Bang Theory started off quietly in Canada, but managed to garner major success later on in further seasons. The Big Bang Theory is telecast throughout Canada via the CTV Television Network in simultaneous substitution with cross-border CBS affiliates. Now immensely popular in Canada, The Big Bang Theory is also rerun daily on the Canadian cable channel The Comedy Network.The season 4 premiere garnered an estimated 3.1 million viewers across Canada. This is the largest audience for a sitcom since the series finale of Friends. The Big Bang Theory has pulled ahead and has now become the most-watched entertainment television show in Canada.[85]As the theme of the show revolves around science, many distinguished and high profile scientists have appeared as guest stars on the show. Famous astrophysicist and Nobel laureate George Smoot had a cameo appearance in episode 17 "The Terminator Decoupling", of the second season.[146] Theoretical physicist Brian Greene also appeared on the show in "The Herb Garden Germination", episode 20 of the fourth season. Astrophysicist and science populizer Neil deGrasse Tyson appeared in "The Apology Insufficiency", episode 7 of the fourth season. Cosmologist Stephen Hawking made a short guest appearance in the fifth-season episode "The Hawking Excitation" on April 5, 2012.[147] In the episode he meets Sheldon Cooper and points out a mistake in his new Higgs boson analysis. In the end of season 5 and the beginning of season 6 featured NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino multiple times as himself as one of Howard's fellow astronauts.Warner Bros. Television controls the online rights for the show.[148][149] Full episodes are available at tv.com, while short clips and recently aired full episodes are available on cbs.com.[150] Full episodes are also available on Sohu.com in China.[151] In Canada, recent episode(s) and pictures are available on CTV.ca.[152] After the show has aired in New Zealand the shows are available in full online at TVNZ's on demand web service.In May 2010, it was reported that the show has been picked up for syndication, mainly among Fox's O&O group and other local stations, with Warner Bros. Television's sister cable network TBS holding the show's cable syndication rights. Broadcast of old shows began airing in September 2011. TBS now airs the series in primetime on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, with evening broadcasts on Saturdays (TBS's local sister station in Atlanta also holds local weeknight rights to the series).[153] Although details of the syndication deal have not been revealed, it was reported the deal "set a record price for a cable off-network sitcom purchase".[154] CTV holds national broadcast syndication rights in Canada, while sister cable network The Comedy Network holds cable rights.Through the use of his vanity cards at the end of episodes, Lorre alleged that the program had been plagiarized by a show produced and aired in Belarus. Officially titled  (The Theorists), the show features "clones" of the main characters, a similar opening sequence, and what appears to be a very close Russian translation of the scripts.[155] Lorre expressed annoyance and described his inquiry with the Warner Brothers legal department about options. The television production company and station's close relationship with the Belarus government was cited as the reason that any attempt to claim copyright infringement would be in vain because the company copying the episodes is operated by the government.[156]However, no legal action was required to end production of the other show: as soon as the word got out that the show was unlicensed, the actors quit and the producers cancelled it.[157] Dmitriy Tankovich (who plays Leonard's counterpart, "Seva") said in an interview: "I'm upset. At first, the actors were told all legal issues were resolved. We didn't know it wasn't the case, so when the creators of The Big Bang Theory started talking about the show, I was embarrassed. I can't understand why our people first do, and then think. I consider this to be the rock bottom of my career. And I don't want to take part in a stolen show".[158]Johnny GaleckiJim ParsonsKaley CuocoSimon HelbergKunal NayyarSara GilbertMelissa RauchMayim BialikKevin Sussman[2]1 Production

He received his Ph.D. when he was 24 years old. He is originally from New Jersey. The straight man of the series, he shares an apartment with colleague and friend Sheldon Cooper. The writers immediately implied potential romance between him and neighbor Penny, and their sexual tension is frequently explored including occasional dating. In Season 3, Leonard begins an on-again, off-again romantic relationship with Penny, although the two continue to live separately.Jim Parsons[34] as Sheldon Cooper, B.S., M.S., M.A., Ph.D., Sc.D.[35]  Originally from East Texas, he was a child prodigy with an eidetic memory who began college at the age of 11 (after completing the fifth grade), started graduate studies at 14, and earned a Ph.D. at 16. A theoretical physicist focusing on quantum mechanics and string theory, he has a master's degree, a Ph.D., an Sc.D., and an IQ of 187. He exhibits a strict adherence to routine; a lack of understanding of irony and sarcasm; he is also uninterested in many of the romantic hijinks of his friends. Sheldon shares an apartment with Leonard Hofstadter, across the hall from Penny, and relies on both for advice in social situations. Sheldon is very egotistical, and he often brags about his smarts, although he lacks social skills. Sheldon relies on his friends to drive him around, and he eventually tries to go for his driver's licence but is unable to complete the task. In the fourth season, he begins a relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler, who becomes his first girlfriend during the fifth season, even though he is wary of germs and physical contact. He is a very introverted character. He is also famous for knocking on a door before saying the name of whom he's addressing, repeating this three times.Kaley Cuoco[36] as Penny  From a small town outside of Omaha, Nebraska,[37] a blonde who lives across the hall from Sheldon and Leonard. She is pursuing a career in acting, and has been on casting calls and auditions but has not been very successful thus far. To pay the bills, she is a waitress and occasional bartender at The Cheesecake Factory. To date, her last name has not been revealed. She dated Leonard at the end of the first season, and during the third and fifth seasons.[38] By season four, Bernadette, Amy and Penny have formed their own group, who like to hang out in Penny's apartment or go out together.Simon Helberg[39] as Howard Wolowitz, M.Eng.[40]  He works as an aerospace engineer. He is Jewish, and lives with his mother. Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, and Raj, Howard lacks a Ph.D. He defends this by pointing out that he has a master's degree in engineering from MIT and that the apparatus he designs are launched into space, unlike the purely abstract work of his friends. He fancies himself a ladies' man and devises outrageous pick-up lines, with suitably unimpressed reactions from Penny and limited success with other women. He claims to be a polyglot. He dates and later marries Bernadette Rostenkowski. In the fifth season, he trained as an astronaut, and blasted off into space in the season finale to serve as a payload specialist on the International Space Station.Kunal Nayyar[41] as Rajesh Koothrappali, Ph.D.  Originally from New Delhi, India, he works as a particle astrophysicist at Caltech.[42] His family is very wealthy. He communicates with his parents, Dr. and Mrs. V.M. Koothrappali, via webcam. He is very shy around women and is physically unable to talk to them unless he drinks alcohol, or at least thinks he has been drinking alcohol, or has taken experimental medications provided by the pharmacology department at the university. However, he has often had better luck with women than his overly-confident best friend Howard. He has very feminine tastes and often takes on a stereotypical female role in his close friendship with Howard, but he insists that he is not gay.[43] During the fourth season, his sister Priya (Aarti Mann) stays with him and becomes Leonard's girlfriend.Sara Gilbert as Leslie Winkle, Ph.D. (recurring season 1, starring season 2, recurring season 3)[44][45]  a physicist who works in the same lab as Leonard. In appearance she is essentially Leonard's female counterpart, equipped with the black framed glasses and sweat jackets. She is an enemy of Sheldon's, due to their conflicting scientific theories. Though each considers the other to be intellectually inferior, Leslie is much wittier than Sheldon, regularly calling him "dumbass", and she usually bests him in their repartee. Leslie has had casual sex with Leonard and later Howard; in the case of the former, it reunited Gilbert and Galecki on-screen after the two played the on-screen couple of Darlene Connor and David Healy during the run of Roseanne. Gilbert was promoted to a main cast member during the second season but was demoted again because producers could not generate enough content for the character.[44] Gilbert left the series after season 3 concluded to focus her efforts on The Talk, on which she serves as executive producer for CBS.Melissa Rauch as Bernadette Rostenkowski-Wolowitz, Ph.D. (recurring season 3, starring since season 4)[46]  a young woman who is initially a waitress and co-worker of Penny's, paying her way through graduate school microbiology studies, she defends her doctoral thesis and lands a high-paying science position at the end of season 4. Bernadette is introduced to Howard by Penny. At first they do not get along, apparently having nothing in common. When they find out that they both have overbearing mothers, they feel a connection. During season 3 they date and then break up off-screen, then get back together in season 4. They become engaged near the end of season 4, and marry at the end of season 5.Mayim Bialik as Amy Farrah Fowler, Ph.D. (guest starring season 3, starring since season 4)[47]  a woman Raj and Howard met on an online dating site after secretly setting up an account using Sheldon's name and information. The site matches her to Sheldon, and the two share many similar traits though Amy is more interested in social and romantic interaction. Once she and Sheldon meet, she becomes, as Sheldon puts it, a girl who is his friend, but not his "girlfriend". In Season 5, Amy made Sheldon jealous by going on a date with comic book store owner, Stuart, causing Sheldon to solidify their relationship as boyfriend/girlfriend. Sheldon then insisted that Amy sign a 31-page "Relationship Agreement". Amy also believes she and Penny are best friends ("besties", by her own definition), a sentiment that at first Penny respectfully indulges but doesn't share. Penny eventually becomes a real friend, overlooking Amy's "Sheldon"-like qualities. Amy's admiration for Penny has at times bordered on attraction. Amy Fowler has a Ph.D. in neurobiology, while Bialik herself has a doctorate in neuroscience; in the season 1 episode "The Bat Jar Conjecture", Raj suggests recruiting the real-life Bialik to their Physics Bowl team.Kevin Sussman as Stuart Bloom (appeared in 13 episodes in seasons 25, promoted to main cast in season 6)  Stuart runs the comic book store that the guys frequently visit. He is also a nerd, but he has a talent for drawing, is a graduate of Rhode Island School of Design and possesses more social skills than the rest of the guys. During Stuart's first appearance, the guys brought Penny along to the store and he managed to ask her on a date. The date went fine until Stuart was dragged into discussing comic books by Sheldon, leaving Penny bored. On a second date with Penny, Stuart asked for Leonard's advice, but feeling threatened, Leonard ultimately gave him bad advice. The date went fine, but when Penny was getting romantic with Stuart she mistakenly called him "Leonard", leaving him devastated. Stuart was the partner of Wil Wheaton in the card game tournament, where they defeated Raj and Sheldon. As Stuart runs a comic book store, he has vast knowledge of comic books and superheroes. In the Season 4 episode "The Toast Derivation", he implied he was in financial trouble and that the comic book store is now also his home. At Howard's bachelor party during the "The Stag Convergence" episode, Stuart uses his toasting turn to tell Howard how lucky he is and compares it to his own situation of living in the back of a comic book store. In Season 6, he is invited to be part of the guys' group while Howard is in space. Sheldon is not very accepting of this due to Stuart's art degree, but relents after Stuart offers him a 30% off discount in the comic book store.Despite the third and fourth seasons receiving Blu-ray releases in conjunction with their DVD releases, the first and second seasons were only available on DVD upon their time of release. Warner Bros. has since released the first two seasons on Blu-ray/DVD combo packs with UltraViolet downloads on July 10, 2012. All of the episodes from seasons 1 & 2 on Blu-ray received newly remastered surround-sound audio, with the first season sporting a never-before-seen gag reel, which was not included during the initial first season DVD release.[145]Official websiteVanity Cards Archive for The Big Bang TheoryThe Big Bang Theory at the Internet Movie DatabaseDancing with the Stars is a dance competition show airing on ABC in the United States, and CTV in Canada in 2011. The show is the American version of the British television series Strictly Come Dancing. Tom Bergeron is the Emmy-winning host, with co-hosts Lisa Canning (season 1), Samantha Harris (seasons 29),[1] and Brooke Burke Charvet (season 10 onwards).[2]The contestant pairs consist of a celebrity paired with a professional dancer. Past celebrity contestants include professional and Olympic athletes, supermodels, actors, singers, astronauts, and teen-heartthrobs. Each couple performs predetermined dances and competes against the others for judges' points and audience votes. The couple receiving the lowest combined total of judges' points and audience votes is eliminated each week until only the champion dance pair remains.In 2012, GSN picked up rerun rights to seasons four to thirteen, but due to low ratings the network stopped airing the show after airing for three months from January 2012 to April 2012 in two different seasons aired mostly on weekends. However, the network still has rights to the show.[3]Season 15, which began airing in fall 2012, brought back celebrities from previous seasons.[4][5][6]Since its premiere in 2005, the show has been hosted by Tom Bergeron. For the first season, Bergeron was joined by co-host Lisa Canning. For seasons two through nine (20062009) Samantha Harris co-hosted the show. For season ten onwards (2010present), the co-host has been Brooke Burke, who was season seven champion (Fall 2008). Drew Lachey, who won season two (2006), appeared as a guest presenter for three weeks in season five (2007) while Harris was on maternity leave.Len Goodman, Carrie Ann Inaba and Bruno Tonioli have been the three main judges since the premiere. Several former contestants have also appeared as a judge, either on a specific episode or replacing one of the main judges in their absence, including Drew Lachey, Emmitt Smith, Apolo Anton Ohno, Hlio Castroneves, Mel B, Kristi Yamaguchi, Gilles Marini and Kelly Osbourne. Other celebrities, most often those who are associated with the world of dancing, have appeared as a fourth judge or in absence of one of the main judges, including Michael Flatley, Baz Luhrmann, Donnie Burns and Paula Abdul.Key:  Previous  CurrentA total of 162 celebrities have appeared in the 14 seasons of the series. For each season, the celebrities are paired with a professional partner who instructs them in the various dances each week and competes alongside them in the televised competition. A total of 31 professional partners have appeared alongside celebrities, some for only one season. The longest-tenured professional partners are Cheryl Burke and Tony Dovolani, who have each appeared in 14 seasons. For season 12, the ABC Dancing with the Stars website asked viewers to submit the names of celebrities they would like to see appear on the show in a future season.Bold denotes in the most recent season.A dance troupe has appeared during the Tuesday results shows since season 12. The current (season 15) members of the troupe include Oksana Dmytrenko (season 12present), Sasha Farber (season 13present), Sharna Burgess (season 13present), Henry Byalikov[7](season 14present), Emma Slater[7](season 14present) and Sonny Fredie Pedersen (season 15present),. In season 12, professional partners Tony Dovolani and Lacey Schwimmer appeared with the troupe in week four due to their early elimination. In season 13, Val Chmerkovskiy and Peta Murgatroyd (both new partners) appeared with the troupe due to their early elimination in week three. Former members include: Tristan MacManus (season 12), Peta Murgatroyd (season 12), Kiki Nyemchek (seasons 1214), Nicole Volynets (season 12), Ted Volynets (seasons 1213) and Dasha Chesnokova (season 13).The Harold Wheeler orchestra provides most of the music, and (early in the season) the singers that accompany the competitors' dances. Guest artists accompany many of the professionals' dance routines.Note: Season one lasted six weeks, however there was an additional week (face-off) that occurred months after the finale.In seasons one and two, only the overall ranking between competitors by the judges and the public was relevant. In season three and all subsequent seasons, the scoring system has made the exact scores relevant as well.The scoring begins with the judges' marks. Originally, Each judge gives a numeric score from 110, for a total score from 330. The scoring changed in season 15. Now judges can give scores from 0.5-10.0, for a total score from 1.5-30.0. When multiple performances are scored, only the cumulative total counts. The contestants' "judges' shares" are calculated as the percentage of the total number of points awarded to all contestants that evening. (For example, if a team earned 20 points on a night when the judges awarded 200 points, their judges' share would be 20/200 = 10%.) This percentage is then added to the percentage of North American votes received by each contestant. The bottom two couples are identified in the results show, and the couple with the lowest combined total gets eliminated.[8] Season eight added an occasional "dance-off," in which contestants could re-do one of their dances, in an effort to improve their judges' score. This might be discontinued due to the eliminated couple always scoring higher than or equivalent to the couple that was saved.Public voting is conducted via a toll-free number, the ABC web site, and, most recently, text messages; contestants can vote during and immediately after each performance show. The maximum number of votes per voter per medium is equal to the number of couples performing that night, or five votes, whichever is larger. In April 2010 it was revealed that dancer Kate Gosselin had e-mailed friends and family asking them to vote as many as ten times each.[9] In November 2010, the Washington Post reported that online voting appeared not to require a valid email address, and accordingly that a large number of votes apparently could be cast by one person.[10]In several cases where ESPN coverage of Monday Night Football airs instead on an ABC affiliate in an NFL team's home market, the program is delayed to air immediately after that station's local news, and a voting window confined only to the area codes of the pre-empted market is opened up to allow affected viewers to still put their votes in for the competition, though this is on a market-by-market basis (in some markets, an alternate sister station or digital subchannel carries the program live as scheduled).Seasons one and three featured only two celebrities in the final week instead of three.On the April 18, 2006 episode of the Howard Stern Radio Show, Stern's wife Beth said that she was guaranteed to earn $125,000 for just appearing on DWTS (in season 3) and could earn up to more than double the original sum, depending on how long she lasted on the program.[11][12]The first person to withdraw from competition was Romeo in the season two.[13] His father, Master P, took his place in the competition, being partnered with Ashly DelGrosso. However, Romeo later competed in season 12[14] and finished in 5th place. Romeo was partnered with Chelsie Hightower.On week six season three, Sara Evans cited her divorce as the reason for leaving the competition. No one was eliminated that week.Another withdrawal occurred during the run-up to season four on February 28, when Vincent Pastore withdrew from the competition after only one week of training. Pastore said he did not realize how much work was needed during a ten-week period, and that he was not up to the physical demands of the show. He was replaced on March 2 by Pixar voice actor John Ratzenberger who was partnered with Edyta Sliwinska.[15]In season seven, Misty May-Treanor withdrew from the competition in week three, after rupturing her Achilles tendon when rehearsing her Jive with her partner, Maksim Chmerkovskiy. She did not perform the routine at all nor was she scored for it; no one else was eliminated that week.In season eight, Jewel and Nancy O'Dell were injured before the season even began and could not compete. Jewel was diagnosed with fractured tibias in both legs; she came back later in the season to perform "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" on a results show. O'Dell suffered from a torn knee cartilage.[16] They were replaced by Holly Madison and Melissa Rycroft who would be dancing with their partners for the rest of the season (Dmitry Chaplin and Tony Dovolani).Tom DeLay, in season nine, withdrew in week three of competition due to a full stress fracture that had developed in both feet from an earlier pre-stress fracture in one foot. Delay was declared safe before he announced his withdrawal during the October 6, 2009 results show. Debi Mazar was still eliminated that night despite DeLay's departure.Celebrities and professional partners have experienced minor injuries, or in some cases more serious, which did not affect later performances.In season five, Marie Osmond infamously fainted after her performance in week five of the competition, after which the program immediately went into commercial; however, Osmond was able to regain composure and continued with the program. Episodes of food poisoning or the flu have caused stars like Jane Seymour to miss portions of other programs. Mark Ballas dislocated his shoulder when he came back in the finale to dance again with his eliminated partner, Sabrina Bryan.In season six, Cristin de la Fuente suffered a ruptured tendon in his left biceps muscle during his performance on week seven. The judges critiqued him according to his performance up to the injury. He was sent to the hospital immediately and missed the end of the show. Derek Hough injured his neck in a rehearsal with Shannon Elizabeth but still performed.In season seven, Julianne Hough was rushed to the hospital after the results show on Week 6 with increasingly severe stomach pains. She was released the same night after it was determined that it was "just a bad stomach ache".[17] However, she was ordered to sit out the group hip-hop dance rehearsals the next day as a precaution.[18] On the October 27 performance show, Hough announced that she had been diagnosed with endometriosis and would be having surgery on October 28 to have her appendix removed.[19] Cody Linley, her partner, stayed to dance with Hough's temporary replacement, Edyta Sliwinska, who had been eliminated first. She returned in the semi-finals to dance with Linley and was eliminated with him that week.In season eight, after landing on a wireless microphone pack and injuring his back during a dress rehearsal, Steve-O and his partner, Lacey Schwimmer, were unable to perform live. The judges critiqued their pre-recorded dress rehearsal performance. Melissa Rycroft suffered a rib cage injury also during a rehearsal and was judged based upon her pre-recorded dress rehearsal. Before her Group Mambo, professional Lacey Schwimmer filled in for her dancing with Tony Dovolani.In season nine, both Lacey Schwimmer and Derek Hough had the flu and could not perform with their partners (Mark Dacascos and Joanna Krupa) who ended up dancing with substitute pros (Anna Trebunskaya and Maksim Chmerkovskiy).In season ten, Evan Lysacek broke two of his toes during rehearsal. The injury was not bad enough to affect his ability to dance and he remained in the competition. He also had a mild concussion after falling on his head while doing a lift with his partner, Anna Trebunskaya, but he remained in the competition. Mark Ballas injured his knee and his partner, Shannen Doherty, was going to be dancing with Ballas' father, Corky but she was eliminated and did not have to dance at all anymore. Mark returned on May 4 results show to dance to "Hey, Soul Sister" performed by Train.In season 11, Jennifer Grey was recovering from cancer and tumors in her neck. This caused her great pain during the show. In week seven it was revealed that she had torn a knee tendon. On the day of the finale results show, she had a procedure done that morning due to an injury that happened during her night one of performances. She had ruptured a disk and was unsure if she was going to perform for night two of dances. She ended up performing and winning season 11.In season 12, Ralph Macchio suffered a leg injury that affected his rehearsals for week eight. He still made it through to the semi-finals before being eliminated. Professional Dancer Kym Johnson suffered a neck injury during rehearsals for her semi-final argentine tango while attempting a lift. She eventually recovered and went on to win season 12 with Hines Ward.In season 13, Maksim Chmerkovskiy hurt one of his toes before rehearsal and brought in Ted Volynets from the dance troupe to prepare a Samba with Maksim's partner (Hope Solo) in week seven. While in rehearsals for week nine, J.R. Martinez suffered an ankle injury but stayed in the competition and was the last celebrity voted into the finals and ended up winning the show.In season 14, Maria Menounos broke two ribs in an incident where her ribs hit her partner, Derek Hough's, knee. She also had a stress fracture in her feet which both didn't affect her performance. The next week she hit her chin during rehearsals when her partner dropped her on the floor. Melissa Gilbert suffered a head injury during her performance causing her to miss the end of the show and the results show the next night. They were revealed to be safe. William Levy injured his ankle but still danced a great performance. Katherine Jenkins suffered a head injury when her partner Mark Ballas kneed her on the head in rehearsals. She still danced later that evening.In season 15, Melissa Rycroft suffered a herniated disc during her Team Freestyle rehearsal. She still danced that night. Pro Derek Hough suffered a neck injury during week six, so Mark Ballas who was Bristol Palin's partner (eliminated in week 4) filled in as Shawn Johnson's partner for week seven. Ballas was Johnson's partner in season eight it was the season they won. Kelly Monaco suffered a broken toe on her right foot while rehearsing for her week four contemporary dance with partner Valentin Chmerkovskiy. She went on to dance that night and advanced to the following week.Beginning season seven, viewers had the opportunity to vote for their favorite pros (or in some cases former contestants) to dance to a style of dance as well as a song to dance to. An online contest is also usually held so viewers can submit drawings of outfits for the performance.Season 7: Derek Hough and Julianne Hough dancing the Jive to "Great Balls of Fire"

Their choices were:In season 11, viewers were allowed two votes per day on the DWTS website to vote for their favorite out of 30 given choices. On October 25, 2010, a countdown of the Top 10 voted for dances on the show was reported to celebrate the following week when the 200th show would be.On the actual 200th show, several dances were performed again on the show and six of the past fan favorites came back to judge; Helio Castroneves, Emmitt Smith, Drew Lachey, Kelly Osbourne, Gilles Marini, Mel B, and more.

At the end of the spring 2011 season, 28 athletes have competed on the show, representing 20% of the contestants. They've won six competitions and placed second four times; a collective success (win or runner-up) rate of 36%. In other words, better than one third of the athletes who have appeared on the show have finished either first or second. This is far better than the rate for reality-show contestants, supermodels, actors, politicians and other celebrities. Musicians/singers, at 27%, are the second most successful group.It is speculated by the cast and staff on the show as well as the athletes themselves, that they have several advantages in some key areas:[22]There are disadvantages as well, particularly with the larger athletes such as football and basketball players. Some of these athletes have difficulty making their over-sized frames look graceful on the dance floor. However, this can also be an advantage: since this struggle with their large size is often plainly apparent during their performances, voters will tend to give them more leeway in this area, while an actor or singer with known dance background or training may be held to a higher standard in the voters' minds.[23]In every season finale in which an athlete was present, and was either tied for the top of the leader board or one point behind the leader said athlete went on to win the season. This has happened on five occasions:Dance studios are now being opened by some of the DWTS professional dancers. At some studios, the professionals actually teach dance classes to the general public. Here are a list of some of the locations: Dance With Me Dance Studio- Soho, NY; Long Island, NY; Ridgefield, NJ; Stamford, CT [24] Karina Smirnoff Dance Studio- Woodland Hills, CA [25] You Can Dance Studio- Hermosa Beach, CA [26]A DVD titled Dancing With The Stars: Cardio Dance was released on April 3, 2007 featuring Kym Johnson, Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Ashly DelGrosso. The program contains cardiovascular workouts adapted from Cha-cha, paso doble, samba, and jive dance routines.A second DVD Dancing with the Stars: Latin Cardio Dance was released on September 13, 2008 featuring Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Cheryl Burke. The program contains cardiovascular workouts adapted from Cha-cha, Merengue, Samba and Mambo dance routines.[27]A third and fourth DVD was released featuring Kym Johnson, Dmitry Chaplin, and Lacey Schwimmer. One DVD is called Dance off the Pounds and features three dances: the jive, the quickstep, and swing. The other is Dance Body Tone and features a Latin dance mix, the tango, and freestyle dance mix.Julianne Hough, two time DWTS winner, has also released her own workout DVD called Dance with Julianne: Cardio Ballroom. It includes the Paso Doble, the Cha-Cha, and the Jive. It was released on December 15, 2009.[28]Julianne Hough, released her second workout DVD called Dance With Julianne: Just Dance. It includes Jazz, Hip Hop, Box Step, Three Step and Dance Classics. It was released on November 9, 2010.[29]A companion book written by Guy Phillips was released in the early fall of 2007. Titled Dancing with the Stars: Jive, Samba and Tango Your Way Into The Best Shape Of Your Life, the book has includes fitness routines modeled by Alec Mazo and Edyta Sliwinska, as well as original costume designs, lists of performed songs during a dance, and a complete list of song-and-dance routine performed since the first season of the show.The first Dancing spin-off, Dance War: Bruno vs. Carrie Ann, premiered on January 7, 2008 on ABC. The show's format was similar to the BBC Television series, Dance X. The show was canceled after one season.
A figure skating spin-off similar to ITV's Dancing on Ice called Skating with the Stars aired on ABC on November 22, 2010. The series was canceled after one season, as well.[30]The program has also been nominated for various other production-related awards since premiering in 2005.Dancing with the Stars at TV.com1 Cast

Professional dancer Cheryl Burke states, "They are used to being coached and they respond to criticism better than, say, actors". Casting director Deena Katz says, "They know their limits and don't overtrain like some others do", and so they avoid injuries, which hamper many of the contestants.Competitive instinct  Successful athletes are competitive individuals and therefore comfortable in an environment which encourages "bettering" an opponent. In addition, they are familiar with performing under pressure and in some cases, thrive on it. Highly successful, elite athletes are capable of performing at their highest level when it is most important. They are able to focus and possibly even raise the quality of their performance during the biggest of competitions, whereas other contestants may falter under the same pressure.[22]Season 3: Emmitt Smith and Mario Lopez tied in the finale, with both scoring 89/90Season 5: Helio Castroneves scored one point behind Mel B in the finale, scoring 84/90 to her 85/90 (Castroneves is the only, male, non-NFL player for this to occur to)Season 8: Shawn Johnson and Gilles Marini tied in the finale, with both scoring 88/90 (Johnson is the only female athlete for this to occur to)Season 12: Hines Ward and Chelsea Kane tied in the finale, with both scoring 89/90 (Kane, however, landed in third place)Season 14: Donald Driver scored one point behind Katherine Jenkins in the finale, scoring 89/90 to her 90/90Strictly Come Dancing, the original British version of the programDancing with the Stars, which contains a full list of international versionsOfficial websiteDancing with the Stars at the Internet Movie DatabaseThe template Tv.com is being considered for deletion."List of Dancing with the Stars Episodes".

It is based on a screenplay developed by J. J. Abrams and Jonathan Nolan.[1] The series revolves around a former CIA agent (Jim Caviezel) recruited by a mysterious billionaire (Michael Emerson) to prevent violent crimes in New York City. Season two premiered on September 27, 2012.[2]"You are being watched. The government has a secret system: a machine that spies on you every hour of every day. I know because I built it. I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything. Violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you. Crimes the government considered irrelevant. They wouldn't act, so I decided I would. But I needed a partner, someone with the skills to intervene. Hunted by the authorities, we work in secret. You'll never find us, but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up... we'll find you".John Reese (Jim Caviezel), a former Green Beret and CIA field officer, is living as a derelict in New York City after an unspecified incident, and is presumed dead. He is approached by Harold Finch (Michael Emerson), a reclusive billionaire computer genius who is living under an assumed identity. Finch explains that after 9/11, he built a computer system for the government which uses information gleaned from omnipresent surveillance to predict future terrorist attacks. However, Finch discovered that the computer was predicting ordinary crimes as well. While the government was not interested in these results, Finch is determined to find a way to stop the predicted crimes. He hires Reese to conduct surveillance and intervene as needed, using his repertoire of skills gained in the military and CIA. Through a back door built into the system, Finch receives a Social Security number for someone who will be involved in an imminent crime, at which point he contacts Reese. Without knowing what the crime will be, when it will occur, or even if the person they were alerted to is a victim or perpetrator, Reese and Finch must try to stop the crime from occurring.They are helped by NYPD Detectives Lionel Fusco (Kevin Chapman), a corrupt cop whom Reese coerces into helping them, and Joss Carter (Taraji P. Henson) who had originally been investigating Reese for his vigilante activities. Although Reese arranged for Carter and Fusco to be partners in the NYPD early in the series, for the entirety of the show's first season, neither was aware that the other was also working with Finch and Reese. Periodically, the team enlists the aid of Zoe Morgan (Paige Turco), a professional "fixer" who applies her skills to particularly difficult tasks. A major subplot concerns "HR", an organization of corrupt NYPD officers in league with budding mob boss Carl Elias (Enrico Colantoni). Led by several high-ranking officers, the members of HR work with Elias in an attempt to return New York to the old order, when the mob and police worked together. Elias, on the other hand, is merely using HR as a means to regain complete control of New York's organized crime. Despite his desire to be seen as a good cop, Reese forces Fusco to appear to be in league with HR, which allows him to keep tabs on the activities of both HR and Elias. A second major subplot is that of Root, a murderous female hacker who is determined to gain access to the Machine. Finch and Reese know little about Root and her objectives, but have begun to gather background information about her in an effort to stay a step ahead of her.The following characters are involved in the HR storyline, in which a group of corrupt police officers work in collaboration with an up and coming mob boss to control organized crime in New York.The following characters are part of Reese's backstory relating to his time with the CIA.The series was officially picked up by CBS on May 13, 2011,[4] and debuted on September 22, 2011.[5]According to CBS, Person of Interest received the highest test ratings of any drama pilot in 15 years,[6] what one CBS executive called "crazy broad appeal you don't usually see," prompting CBS to move CSI, which was broadcast on Thursday for over 10 years, to Wednesday, opening up a slot for Person of Interest.[7] The pilot episode won its time slot, drawing 13.2 million viewers.[8] On October 25, 2011, the show received a 22 episode full season order. The order was later increased to 23 episodes.[9]David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle said "Person of Interest separates itself from the gimmick pack, not only because of superbly nuanced characterization and writing but also because of how it engages a post-9/11 sense of paranoia in its viewers."[10] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News gave the pilot four stars out of five, commenting on Caviezel and Emerson's performances, saying Caviezel "brings the right stuff to this role" and Emerson "is fascinating as Mr. Finch."[11] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times stated, "the notion of preventing crimes rather than solving them is an appealing twist...The surveillance graphics are very cool."[1]The following table lists the countries in which Person of Interest airs outside the USA.Person of Interest won Favorite New TV Drama at the 2012 People's Choice Awards.[24]1 Plot2 Characters

2.2.1 HR2.2.2 CIA2.2.1 HR2.2.2 CIA4.1 Critical reception4.2 RatingsJohn Reese (Jim Caviezel): a former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier and CIA field officer, who is presumed dead. Little is known about Reese's background, and his name is one of several aliases he uses. He lost his lover, Jessica, prior to meeting Finch, which appears to have marked him deeply. Reese demonstrates skill in the use of a range of weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and surveillance tactics. He knows very little about Finch and is often rebuffed when he attempts to learn more about him.Harold Finch (Michael Emerson): a reclusive and intensely private billionaire software genius. Finch developed a machine that can isolate the Social Security numbers of people with either premeditated homicidal intent or who will be homicide victims, based on its analysis of surveillance data. Following a traumatic event in his own life that led to the death of his business partner, he recruits Reese to help him deal with the people the Machine identifies. Finch lives and works in an abandoned library, and shows the results of severe physical injuries, including the inability to turn his head, rigid posture, and a limp.Detective Joss Carter (Taraji P. Henson): a NYPD detective whose husband was killed in the line of duty, leaving her as a single mother to a teenaged son, Taylor. Carter is a former U.S. Army interrogator who passed the bar exam in 2004, but gave up practicing the law to return to police work. Carter first crosses paths with Reese following his encounter with a group of young men on a New York subway, but knew him principally as a mysterious man in a suit. Carter is initially determined to apprehend Reese, but eventually forms an alliance with him and Finch. She is unaware of the Machine's existence.Detective Lionel Fusco (Kevin Chapman): a corrupt cop who Reese blackmails into being a source inside the police department. Finch later arranges for Fusco to be transferred to Carter's precinct so that he works with her. Over time, Fusco becomes increasingly loyal to Finch and Reese. Like Carter, he does not know about the Machine.Zoe Morgan (Paige Turco): a fixer who specializes in crisis management. Finch and Reese first meet her as a person of interest; later, she works with them on cases that require her skills. She has an ill-disguised interest in Reese.Jessica Arndt (Susan Misner): Reese's deceased lover. After Jessica's relationship with Reese ended, she married another man, but remained in contact with Reese. She was eventually killed accidentally by her husband (Peter Arndt) during a domestic dispute, who then covered it up by using a car accident. It is suggested that Reese disposes of Peter before meeting Finch, but it is left unclear as to his fate.Nathan Ingram (Brett Cullen): Finch's deceased collaborator on the Machine, who died under unknown circumstances. Ingram acted as the interface between the government and their company while the Machine was under development.Alicia Corwin (Elizabeth Marvel): a liaison between Ingram and the government while the Machine was being developed and a former member of the National Security Council. Corwin began living in hiding in a small town after Ingram's death."Root" (Amy Acker): born Samantha (Sam) Groves, Root is a highly intelligent hacker and contract killer with a keen interest in both Finch and the Machine.Special Agent Donnelly (Brennan Brown): an FBI agent who becomes interested in Reese when his case crosses one of Reese's. He periodically offers Carter the opportunity to work with him as he pursues Reese.Detectives Terny (Al Sapienza) and Kane (Anthony Mangano): NYPD homicide detectives with whom Carter and Fusco periodically work.Carl Elias (Enrico Colantoni): a nascent crime boss and the illegitimate son of Mafia don Gianni Moretti. Elias is determined to revive the crime families of New York and to eliminate the Russian mob, with the assistance of elements of the NYPD. He first meets Reese while masquerading as a high school teacher supposedly under threat in Brighton Beach. He eventually had his father and half brother killed off to avenge his birth mother and is now incarcerated. Elias continues to call the shots from behind bars.Captain Womack (John Fiore): the captain in charge of Homicide and Carter's supervisor, he protects members of HR when Carter gets too close. Reese blackmails him into transferring Fusco to Homicide.Officer Simmons (Robert John Burke): a uniformed officer who is now righthand man to HR's leader; he handles HR activities on the street level and threatened Fusco repeatedly.Captain Lynch (Michael Mulheren): a major figure in HR and with whom Fusco must appear to be working. Killed by Fusco to save ReeseScarfaced Cop (David Valcin): an unnamed NYPD uniformed officer who works as Elias' principal enforcer. He is easily identifiable by a large scar on his right cheek.Mark Snow (Michael Kelly): a CIA operative who once worked with Reese and is now trying to find and kill him.Tyrell Evans (Darien Sills-Evans): a CIA agent working with Snow.Kara Stanton (Annie Parisse): Reese's former CIA partner, widely believed to be dead.Official websitePerson of Interest at the Internet Movie DatabasePerson of Interest at TV.comThe Voice TV is a network of music television channels that is owned by ProSiebenSat.1 Media (formally SBS Broadcasting Group).

Presented in mockumentary style, the fictional characters frequently talk directly into the camera. It tells of Jay Pritchett, his second wife and step son, and his two children and their families. Lloyd and Levitan conceived the series while sharing stories of their own "modern families."The series premiered to critical acclaim and was watched by 12.6 million viewers.[1][2] Early on, it was named as a key contender for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[3] Soon after, on October 8, 2009, the series was picked up for a full season.[4][5] The series has received positive reviews from critics and received several award nominations. The series has won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in each of the past three years and the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series three times so far as well, twice for Eric Stonestreet and once for Ty Burrell, as well as the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series twice for Julie Bowen.[6][7] It also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series Musical or Comedy.[8]The syndication rights to the show have also been sold to USA Network and 10 Fox affiliates for a fall 2013 premiere.[9][10][11] The success of the show has also led it to being the sixteenth-highest revenue-generating show for 2010, earning $1.6 million an episode.[12] Brian Lowry, of Variety, sums up the show in regards to the airing of the pilot episode: "Flitting among three storylines, it's smart, nimble and best of all, funny, while actually making a point about the evolving nature of what constitutes 'family'".[13]As Lloyd and Levitan retold stories about their families, it occurred to them that that could be the basis for a show. They started working on the idea of a family being observed in a mockumentary style show. They later decided it could be a show about three families and their experiences,[14] and originally called My American Family.[15] The creators pitched it to three of the four major networks. (They did not pitch it to Fox because of issues Lloyd had with the network over Back to You.)[16] CBS, not ready to use the single-camera style of filming nor ready to make another large commitment, rejected the series (Welcome to The Captain and Worst Week were single-camera sitcoms that recently aired on CBS but both lasted one season). NBC, already having two shows with a mockumentary format  The Office and Parks and Recreation  decided against accepting the show before the success of the other two series decreased. ABC accepted the series and picked it up for a full season.[16] Modern Family is an adaptation of a French TV show Fais pas ci, fais pas a of which ABC bought the rights in 2008.[17]The series quickly became a priority for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) after the pilot episode tested high with focus groups, resulting in the network ordering 16 episodes and adding it to the 20092010 fall lineup days ahead of ABC's official schedule announcement.[18][19][20] The series was given a full season pickup on October 8, 2009.[4][5] On January 12, 2010, ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson announced that Modern Family had been renewed for a second season.[21] A third season was ordered by ABC on January 10, 2011.[22] The series was also picked up for syndication by USA during the first season for 1.5 million dollars and to 10 Fox affiliates during the second season.[9][10][11][23] The series airs in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland on Sky1.[24]Principal photography takes place in Los Angeles.[13] Creators Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan, whose credits both include Frasier, Wings, and Just Shoot Me,[15] are executive producers of the series, serving as showrunner and head writer under their Lloyd-Levitan Productions label in affiliation with Twentieth Century Fox Television.[13] The other producers on the writing team are Paul Corrigan, Sameer Gardezi, Joe Lawson, Dan O'Shannon, Brad Walsh, Caroline Williams, Bill Wrubel, Danny Zuker, and Jeff Morton.[13][25] The first team of directors included Jason Winer, Michael Spiller, Randall Einhorn, and Chris Koch. Winer has directed nineteen episodes of the series, making him the most prolific director of the series.[13][26]As a result of the show's success, the cast attempted in the summer of 2012 to renegotiate their existing contracts to obtain higher per-episode fees. However, talks broke down to the point where the first table read for the fourth season had to be postponed. Five of the cast members (Burrell, Bowen, Ferguson, Stonestreet and Vergara) retained the Quinn Emanuel law firm and sued 20th Century Fox Television in Los Angeles County Superior Court on July 24, 2012. While not part of the lawsuit, Ed O'Neill (who had been earning more per episode than the other five) joined his fellow castmates in seeking raises for each to about $200,000 per episode. Their complaint invoked the "seven-year rule" in California Labor Code Section 2855 (the De Havilland Law), and requested a declaration that their contracts were void because as drafted, the contracts were in violation of that rule.[27] Although the lawsuit is still pending, the performers returned for their first table read on July 26, 2012, with the understanding that the producers would resume contract negotiations in good faith.[28]Modern Family employs an ensemble cast. The show revolves around three families that are interrelated through Jay Prichett and his children, Claire and Mitchell. Jay Prichett (Ed O'Neill), the patriarch, is married to a much younger woman, Gloria (Sofa Vergara), a passionate[29] mother, who raises her son, Manny (Rico Rodriguez). Claire (Julie Bowen) is a homemaker mom married to Phil (Ty Burrell), a real estate agent and self-professed "cool dad". They have three children: Haley (Sarah Hyland) the stereotypical teenager,[30] Alex (Ariel Winter), the smart middle child[31] and Luke (Nolan Gould), the offbeat only son.[32] Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a lawyer, and his partner Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) have adopted a Vietnamese baby, Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons). In the first season, the adult cast was paid from a range of $30,000 per episode to about $90,000.[33]The series has also had several recurring characters. Reid Ewing appeared in several episodes as Haley's boyfriend, Dylan.[34] Fred Willard has guest starred as Phil's father, Frank Dunphy, and later went on to be nominated at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, but lost to Neil Patrick Harris's performance on Glee.[35] Shelley Long has appeared in both seasons as Claire and Mitchell's biological mother and Jay's ex-wife, DeDe Pritchett.[36][37] Nathan Lane appeared twice during the second season as Cameron and Mitchell's flamboyant friend, Pepper Saltzman.[38][39][40]Appearing in a few episodes is Jay and Gloria's dog Stella. Stella was played by Brigitte, but is now being played by Beatrice.[41]The characters in green have regular roles on the show. Dotted lines indicate a parental relationship through adoption or marriage, and dashed lines indicate a divorce between characters.The series premiered Wednesday, September 23, 2009 in the 9:00pm ET timeslot. Soon after, the series was picked up for a full season of 24 episodes on October 8, 2009.[4][5] On January 12, 2010, Modern Family was renewed for a second season by ABC.[42] The second season premiered September 22, 2010, airing in the same timeslot as the previous season.[43] Midway through the second season, the network renewed the series for a third season on January 10, 2011.[22] The third season premiered on September 21, 2011 with two back-to-back episodes,[44] beginning with a one-hour special. On May 10, 2012, Modern Family was renewed for a fourth season by the channel,[45][46] premiering on September 26, 2012.The first season was met with universal critical acclaim. It received a Metacritic score of 86 out of 100.[47] Entertainment Weekly gave it an A-, calling it "immediately recognizable as the best new sitcom of the fall".[48] In Time's review, the show was named "the funniest new family comedy of the year".[49] It has also been compared to the 1970s series Soap, in regards to the multiple family aspect. Some have made comparisons to The Office and Parks and Recreation, due to their mockumentary formats.[50] BuddyTV named the show the second best show in 2009, saying, "Every actor is fantastic, every family is interesting, and unlike many shows, there isn't a weak link".[51] Robert Canning of IGN gave the season a 8.9 saying it was "Great" and called it "Simply put, Modern Family was one of the best new comedies of the season." He also praised the ensemble cast and the characters calling them lovable.[52] According to Metacritic, the first season was the best reviewed new broadcast television series.[53]Modern Family's outstanding cast continues to impress, and even wobbly episodes reliably supply sharp observations and goofball charm.The second season received positive reviews much like the first season, despite being given criticism for a sophomore slump. Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the new season four stars out of four, saying, "Not since Frasier has a sitcom offered such an ideal blend of heart and smarts, or proven itself so effortlessly adept at so many comic variations, from subtle wordplay to big-laugh slapstick to everything in between."[55] Robert Bianco in a later review stated "as good as it was in its first year, is even better in its second" positively comparing the characters to the characters from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Cosby Show and Friends.[56] During the second season, Adweek named the show one of the 100 Most Influential TV Shows (98th chronologically).[57][58] Despite this, the season received criticism from some critics for a sophomore slump.[59][60] Eric Stonestreet, who received praise during the first season,[61] was criticized during the second season for being too over the top.[62][63] Alan Sepinwall called Cameron Tucker a "whiny, overly-sensitive diva".[62] On the other hand, Ty Burrell has received praise for his performance as Phil Dunphy through both seasons.[61][64][65]The third season received an overall mixed reception. Slant Magazine reviewer Peter Swanson wrote that while the first episode was "the type of wacky-location stunt that's usually reserved for the fifth or sixth season of a dying sitcom", the following episodes "have been better [...] but they're still uneven".[66] He also criticized the writers for relying too much on "stunt episodes and celebrity cameos, like David Cross".[66] He ultimately gave the season 3 out of 4 stars.[66] James Parker of The Atlantic said, at the beginning of the third season that "Modern Family is very, very funny, almost ruthlessly so ... [It's] a bit of a master class in pace and brevity ... The writing is Vorsprung durch Technik: hectically compressed but dramatically elegant, prodigal in its zingers and snorters but austere in its construction." He found it an exception to his dislike for sitcoms that eschew a laugh track.[67]In The New York Times, Bruce Feiler called attention to how the show depicts the increasing way communications technology shapes the way people perceive others, even family members. "[It] is surely the first family comedy that incorporates its own hashtag of simultaneous self-analysis directly into the storyline," he writes. "Mark Zuckerberg may be a greater influence on Modern Family than Norman Lear."[68]The show's writers and actors agree. "We used to talk about how cellphones killed the sitcom because no one ever goes to anyone's house anymore" for routine information, Abraham Higginbotham told Feiler. "We embrace technology so it's part of the story." Ty Burrell draws on Fran Lebowitz's observation that there is no institution other than media. "I had this little flash of Philand methat we are parsing our personality together externally from how people perceive us."[68]James Parker said that "The American family circa 2011 is, after all, an acutely self-conscious and self-interrogating unit: How does one 'parent'? Who does what, which 'role'? Is Dad sufficiently dad-like and Mom enough of a mom?" he writes. "Modern Family taps right into all this, the cameras that lurch through its three households producing the sensation of a wild and shaky experiment, recorded for purposes educational or scientific."[67]Modern Family drew criticism from the LGBT community for its portrayal of Cameron and Mitchell as not being physically affectionate with each other. The criticism spawned a Facebook campaign to demand Mitchell and Cameron be allowed to kiss. In response to the controversy, producers released a statement that a season two episode would address Mitchell's discomfort with public displays of affection. Executive producer Levitan has said that it was unfortunate that the issue had arisen, since the show's writers had always planned on such a scene "as part of the natural development of the show."[69] The episode "The Kiss" eventually aired with the kiss scene in the background which drew praise from multiple critics.[70][71]During the third season, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni argued that gay criticism of Cameron and Mitchell actually showed the progress gays have made toward social acceptance. "A decade ago," he writes, "[gays] would have balkedand balked loudlyat how frequently Cameron in particular tips into limp-wristed, high-voiced caricature." But now, "most gay people trust that the television audience knows we're a diverse tribe, not easily pigeonholed ... Modern Family endows us with a sort of comic banality. It's an odd kind of progress. But it's progress nonetheless."[72]Another notable criticism of Modern Family from various online news sources is that the show reinforces gender roles and sexist stereotypes. Michelle Haimoff of the Christian Science Monitor criticized the show for only casting the women as stay-at-home moms while the husbands on the show have very successful careers: "There is a difference between quirky, flawed characters and ones who are incapable of professional success. And when the latter is reliably female, it makes for sexist television. It also makes for unrealistic television."[73] Other authors reinforce this criticism by pointing out that stay-at-home mothers are no longer the norm in today's society.[74] According to the Department of Labor, 68.9% of married moms are working or looking for work. Thus, it's no surprise that the lack of representation for working moms sparked conversation on Twitter: "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon writer Ali Waller asked her Twitter followers, If Modern Family is so modern then why dont any of the women have jobs?[75]According to a CNET staffer, commenting on an episode: "The wife and daughter are unable to learn how to use the remote and must be taught by the father, while the son is 'good with electronics,' even though he is thought of as the stupidest member of the family."[76] In the episode "Game Changer," one of the wives on the show, Gloria, hides her skill at chess so that her husband will not be upset at losing: "On its own, this moment is at best a sappy quip about compromise in an often heavy-handed series, and at worst, it's a moment in a show with 9.3 million viewers, on a network owned by Disney, which explicitly validates girls and women subduing their intellect."[77]By contrast, Hanna Rosin has praised the show as one of several that have begun subverting the longtime American sitcom stereotype of bumbling fathers incapable of managing anything at home despite being the only one employed. "Phil Dunphy should be the house boob, with his embarrassing philosophy of 'peerenting,'" she wrote in Slate. "But Dunphy is not just comic relief; he's a successful salesman and the center of joy and fun in his household, especially compared to his uptight wife. No one really disdains him, and the domestic space belongs as much to him as to her."[78]In 2010, Modern Family was nominated with five Television Critics Association Awards. The show gained nominations for best new series, best comedy series and best program of the year, while Ty Burrell and Eric Stonestreet were nominated individually.[79] Like Friends, to reinforce the idea of an ensemble cast, the cast all submitted themselves in the Supporting Actor and Actress categories instead of Lead Actor and Actress for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards.[80] On August 29, 2010, Modern Family won Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series (for the pilot episode), and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (Eric Stonestreet). The show also later received a GLSEN Respect Award for its portrayal of "positive images and storylines that reflect a diverse America, including the depiction of a family headed by a gay couple."[81] In 2010, the cast won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy, beating the previous year's winner, Glee.[82] On July 14, 2011, the series received 17 Emmy nominations, the third most nominations for the year after Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire.[83] The awards the series was nominated for include Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Supporting Actor for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.[83] The series has also been put on multiple critics' lists.

The series follows a team of profilers from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) based in Quantico, Virginia. The BAU is part of the FBI National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime.[2] The show differs from many procedural dramas by focusing on profiling the criminal, rather than the crime itself. The show is produced by The Mark Gordon Company in association with CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Network Television then CBS Paramount Network Television) and ABC Studios (originally Touchstone Television).CBS announced in October 2009 that Legacy Interactive will develop a video game based on the show. The game will require players to examine crime scenes for clues to help solve murder mysteries. The interactive puzzle game was released in 2012, but did not feature any of the voices of the show's cast. Nor were the cast involved with the project.[3][4][5]On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed Criminal Minds for an eighth season,[6] which premiered on September 26, 2012.When the series premiered in 2005, it featured FBI Agents Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin), Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson), and the rest of the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). For season one, the team was composed of Agents Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini), Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore), Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), Jennifer "JJ" Jareau (A.J. Cook), and Technical Analyst Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness). During season one, Vangsness was not in the regular cast, but instead appeared as a guest star.Casting has been volatile. In season two (200607), Greenaway leaves after episode six and is replaced in episode nine by Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster), the daughter of an ambassador (Kate Jackson). In season three (200708), Gideon departs after episode two, but he is replaced several episodes later by David Rossi (Joe Mantegna), a former FBI agent and best-selling author. In season six (201011), JJ leaves after episode two and is replaced by Ashley Seaver (Rachel Nichols). Later in season six, Prentiss leaves the show; and Cook returns, as a special guest star, to participate in Prentiss' final episode.For season seven (201112), Cook had signed a two-year contract to return as a series regular at the end of season six and for the beginning of season seven. Brewster also returned as a series regular for season seven.[7][8] In May 2011, CBS chose not to pick up Nichols' contract for a second season. Moore's and Gibson's contracts were both renewed. Paget Brewster left the show after season seven,[9] and it was later revealed that Jeanne Tripplehorn would join the cast as Brewster's replacement.[10]Cast and crew at a Paley Centre discussion of the showCast members in 201112: (left to right) Gibson, Cook, Gubler, Mantegna, Brewster and Moore. Absent: Kirsten VangsnessSeven complete seasons of Criminal Minds have been aired, with the eighth season starting on September 26, 2012. As of November 28, 2012(2012 -11-28)[update], a total of 171 episodes have aired.The spin-off debuted February 16, 2011, on CBS[31] but was canceled after a short 13 episode season, due to low ratings.[32]Despite the first two seasons receiving largely positive reviews, subsequent reviews have been mixed. The show holds a Metacritic score of 42/100 as of May 11, 2012.[33]Dorothy Rabinowitz said, in her review for the Wall Street Journal, that "From the evidence of the first few episodes, Criminal Minds may be a hit, and deservedly" and gave particular praise to both Matthew Gray Gubler and Mandy Patinkin's performance.[34]The New York Times was less than positive, saying "The problem with "Criminal Minds" is its many confusing maladies, applied to too many characters" and felt that "as a result, the cast seems like a spilled trunk of broken toys, with which the audience - and perhaps the creators - may quickly become bored."[35]The Chicago Tribune reviewer, Sid Smith, felt that the show "May well be worth a look" though he too criticized the "confusing plots and characters."[36]PopMatters panned the show, saying the show "confuses critical thinking with supernatural abilities" and criticized the "stereotypical characters". The Los Angeles Times gave a similar review.[37] However, both reviewers praised Patinkin and Gubler's performances.[38]Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of Criminal Minds.The show ranked number nine in DVR playback (2.35 million viewers), according to Nielsen prime DVR lift data from September 22, 2008  November 23, 2008.[48]For the week of October 10, 2010, Criminal Minds ranked sixth in DVR playback (2.40 million viewers), and seventh in the demo playback (1.0 demo) according to Nielsen prime DVR lift data.[49]The series is in syndication on A&E Network and ION Television.[50]Criminal Minds at TV.com1 Background2 Characters

Cast members in 201112: (left to right) Gibson, Cook, Gubler, Mantegna, Brewster and Moore. Absent: Kirsten Vangsness


* Although only guest-starring in the first two episodes of the sixth season, A.J. Cook was still billed as a member of the main cast in them. She later appeared as a "special guest-star" in two more episodes that season.Aaron Hotchner (portrayed by Thomas Gibson) is the unit chief of the BAU team. He is a former prosecutor and was originally assigned to the FBI Field Office in Seattle. He is one of the most experienced agents in the BAU. He struggles to balance the demands of his job with his family life, but his wife Haley divorces him in season three. In the season five episode "100", Haley is killed by a fugitive serial killer named George Foyet, also known as "The Reaper", whom Hotchner fights and beats to death. He also has a son named Jack, and a brother named Sean, who appears one time in the first season. After Haley is murdered, he receives sole custody of Jack. Haley's sister, Jessica, helps him with taking care of Jack.Derek Morgan (portrayed by Shemar Moore), a supervisory special agent (and served as interim unit chief for SSA Hotchner), is a confident, assertive, and often hot-tempered character. Raised by his mother Fran, along with his two sisters, Sarah and Desiree, Derek was a troubled Chicago youth headed for juvenile delinquency. He was rescued and mentored by a man who is later arrested for child molestation; Morgan had been one of his victims. After developing an interest in football, he attended Northwestern University on a scholarship. After a football injury left him unable to play football, he joined the Chicago Police Department's bomb squad, then moved to the BAU. He has a special relationship with technical analyst Penelope Garcia, and the two have a unique shorthand and banter. In season seven's "It Takes a Village," Morgan shows complete hatred towards Ian Doyle for killing Prentiss, but when Prentiss returns, he has mixed feelings.Jason Gideon (portrayed by Mandy Patinkin) is a senior supervisory special agent and is widely known as the BAU's best profiler. After a series of emotionally taxing cases, and the murder of his friend Sarah in his own house by a fugitive serial killer, he begins to feel burned out. The last straw occurs when Hotchner is suspended for two weeks by the team's bossan action for which Gideon feels responsible. He retreats to his cabin and leaves a letter for Reid, who he knows will be the one to come looking for him. When Reid arrives at the cabin, it is empty except for the letter and Gideon's badge and firearm. Gideon is last seen remarking to a Nevada diner waitress that he does not know where he is going or how he will know when he gets there, leaving the diner and driving off.David Rossi (portrayed by Joe Mantegna) is a senior supervisory special agent and is a highly experienced profiler who once worked the BAU in its origins, then took early retirement to write books and go on lecture tours about criminal analysis, until volunteering to return shortly after SSA Jason Gideon's departure. He has been married three times. In the season seven episode "From Childhood's Hour," Rossi reconnects with his first wife, Carolyn, who has shocking news for him. It is revealed that she came to him because she was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) and she wanted him to help her "leave this world the way she is, not what she is going to become." In the next episode "Epilogue", Carolyn dies of a drug overdose.Jennifer "JJ" Jareau (portrayed by AJ Cook), is a supervisory special agent. In seasons one through five, she served as the communications liaison to local police agencies. She is dating (and later marries) William LaMontagne, a New Orleans police officer, and the two have a son together, Henry. At the beginning of season six, Jareau is forced to take a promotion to the Pentagon, causing her departure from the team, although Unit Chief Hotchner expressed his hope that she will return to the BAU in the future. JJ returned in the episode "Lauren" to assist the team in finding SSA Emily Prentiss. In the season six finale "Supply and Demand", JJ meets with SSA David Rossi, informing him that she is returning to the BAU. JJ is now a legitimate profiler, thus her brief departure lead to technical analyst Penelope Garcia taking over as liaison.Elle Greenaway (portrayed by Lola Glaudini) is a supervisory special agent. Greenaway is assigned to the FBI Field Office in Seattle, Washington, and assigned to the BAU as an expert in sexual offense crimes. Greenaway suffers extreme emotional trauma after being shot by an unidentified subject in the season one cliffhanger. In the opening episode of season two she survives and returns to duty, sooner than SSA Jason Gideon and Aaron Hotchner would like to see. Several episodes later, while alone on stakeout of a suspected serial rapist, she shoots the man in cold blood. The local police deem it self-defense, but Gideon and Hotchner question her ability as a profiler after this. She resigns, turning her badge and her gun in to Hotchner, with the declaration that this is "not an admission of guilt."Emily Prentiss (portrayed by Paget Brewster) is a supervisory special agent. She is the daughter of Ambassador Elizabeth Prentiss. After SSA Elle Greenaway leaves the BAU, Prentiss shows up with papers assigning her to the BAU. Emily is also fluent in some languages, such as Arabic and Spanish, and has a working knowledge in Italian, but it is revealed that Emily has lost comprehension of her other known language, Russian. She is apparently killed while being held hostage by Ian Doyle in the season six episode "Lauren," but in the last scene of the episode it is suggested that she survived her encounter with Doyle. In the season seven premiere "It Takes a Village" she returns alive and well, and it is shown that she loves children.Dr. Spencer Reid (portrayed by Matthew Gray Gubler), is a supervisory special agent. He is a genius who graduated from a Las Vegas public high school at age 12, and holds PhDs in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Engineering, as well as BAs in Psychology and Sociology, and, as of season four, is working on a BA in Philosophy. It has been revealed that he has an IQ of 187, can read a dizzying 20,000 words per minute, and has an eidetic memory. Most of the members on the team are intimidated by his profound knowledge. He is habitually introduced as "Dr. Reid", in contrast to the other agents' introductions as "Supervisory Special Agent". The purpose of this, as explained by Hotchner in the pilot episode, is to create a respectable first impression of Reid, deflecting judgments about his age. His mother suffers from schizophrenia, and is currently committed to a mental institution. Reid is also the godfather of fellow SSA Jennifer Jareau's son Henry.Penelope Garcia (portrayed by Kirsten Vangsness) is the team's technical analyst. She joined the Bureau after bringing attention upon herself by illegally accessing some of their equipment; she is offered a job in lieu of a jail sentence. She usually supports the team from her computer lab at Quantico, but occasionally joins them on location when her skills can be used in the field. She is a leader in a support group for those who have lost someone in their lives. Her parents were killed by a drunk driver when they were out looking for her when she was a teen and had missed her curfew. She enjoys a flirtatious relationship with SSA Derek Morgan, often engaging in comical banter of a sexually suggestive nature when he calls in for information. She was once shot and almost killed by an unsub who lured her on a date. Garcia is also the godmother of SSA Jennifer Jareau's son Henry.Ashley Seaver (portrayed by Rachel Nichols) is an FBI cadet training at the FBI Academy in Quantico. She shadowed the BAU to help with the investigation into murders in a gated community. She was chosen for her unique background; her father, Charles Beauchamp, was a horrific serial killer known as the "Redmond Ripper", who murdered dozens of women before being caught by the BAU, incidentally. At first, Hotchner was going to make her a special, one-time consultant to the BAU, but Rossi allowed her to finish her remedial training with the team, under the supervision of SSA Prentiss. In "... With Friends Like These", she graduated from the Academy and had been added to the team as a "probationary agent". In the season seven premiere it is revealed that Seaver transferred to the Domestic Trafficking Task Force, which is led by Andi Swann.Dr. Alex Blake (portrayed by Jeanne Tripplehorn) is an FBI Linguistics expert and professor at Georgetown University who joins the BAU after SSA Emily Prentiss transfers to London's Interpol office. She makes her debut in the season eight premiere "The Silencer".Haley Hotchner, portrayed by Meredith Monroe (recurring seasons 15), is Agent Hotchner's wife and the mother of his only son Jack, born in late 2005. The couple's marriage is troubled, due to Haley's perception of Hotch being more devoted to his job and BAU team than to his family. This subplot progresses, and by the end of episode two of season three, Haley moves out, taking Jack with her. Later in the season, Haley serves Hotch with divorce papers, which he decides to sign without contest in order to save his relationship with his son. Haley is occasionally referred to but not seen again until the first episode of season five when The Reaper stabs Hotch and steals Haley's address. Hotch has them put into protective custody. Hotch becomes obsessed with bringing The Reaper to justice so he can see his son and his ex-wife again. In episode nine of season five, The Reaper kills the US Marshal assigned to protect Haley, then lures her to Hotch's home, telling her that he is the replacement and that Hotch is dead. Meeting her alone at the house, he forces her at gunpoint to phone Hotch so he can hear his ex-wife and son being killed. Hotch gives Jack a coded message to hide and says a tearful goodbye to Haley before The Reaper shoots her. Hotch reaches the house ahead of the rest of his team and engages in a life-or-death fist fight with The Reaper. He beats him to death, then finds his son alive in his hiding place.Jordan Todd, portrayed by Meta Golding (season 4), is Jareau's handpicked replacement to serve as the BAU's Media Director during Jareau's maternity leave, from late 2008 through early 2009. Todd had formerly served in the FBI Counterterrorism Division, but only follows Jareau for one day of shadowing before Jareau goes into labor. Todd seemed to get along well with most of the team, even flirting platonically with Derek Morgan. She is especially close with David Rossi, who is seen to counsel her while they are on cases. However, Todd clashed several times with Unit Chief Aaron Hotchner.Dr. Diana Reid, portrayed by Jane Lynch (seasons 14), is the mother of BAU team member Dr. Spencer Reid. Like her son, she has a high IQ and was once a university professor of literature, but suffers from schizophrenia and is hospitalized in a Las Vegas sanitarium, where Spencer committed her when he was eighteen. Her husband William left prior to her diagnosis, because of his inability to cope with her illness and he could not deal with protecting her after she witnessed a murder. She is functional when on her medication, but frequently lapses into regression to her university career. Diana spent much time reading aloud to Spencer while he was growing up, and he continues to write her a letter every day. She is proud of her son, but disapproves of the FBI as it is a government run organization and she refers to his colleagues as "fascists".Erin Strauss, portrayed by Jayne Atkinson (seasons 2present), is the BAU Unit Chief's direct superior. Her FBI experience lies in administration, as she has no actual field experience. Strauss proves to be only concerned with herself and appearances within the Bureau, going so far as to force JJ to accept a promotion to the Pentagon.Kevin Lynch, portrayed by Nicholas Brendon (seasons 3present), first appears in 3.9 ("Penelope"), in which he is required to search Garcia's computer to learn who shot her. Kevin sends the team live video alerting that the unsub is in the BAU headquarters. He is intensely impressed by Penelope's computer skills, and the feeling is mutual. At the end of the episode, Garcia is introduced to Kevin, and the two have been romantically involved ever since. In episode 7.17 "I Love You, Tommy Brown" Kevin proposes to Penelope, but she turns him down saying "things are going too fast" but by the end of season seven, the two seem set on reuniting.William LaMontagne, Jr., portrayed by Josh Stewart (seasons 2present), is JJ's husband (as of the season 7 finale) and father of JJ's son, Henry. Will and JJ met while JJ was working a case in his hometown. As of early season four, Will had moved to Virginia, and is a stay-at-home dad for Henry until he became a detective for the Metropolitan Police Department (Washington DC) as shown in the season seven finale. It is also stated that the couple had made a deal that in a life-threatening situation, they would do everything so that one of them could live to look after Henry. JJ accepted his marriage proposal in the season seven finale and they were married officially, however when their son was born, they did exchange rings with insets of Henry's birthstone, citrine. He is seen briefly in the 100th episode getting medicine for Henry with JJ, as well as "The Slave of Duty", accompanying JJ and the team at Haley's funeral. He is also seen throughout the season seven finale which focuses on JJ's family.In season 2 episode "The Big Game" Criminal Minds set a series high rating by attracting an audience of 26.31 million viewers and a 1849 rating of 9.3.[47]Official websiteCriminal Minds at Yahoo!

TV Guide. http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/criminal-minds/192244.Gamespy Article On The GameLegacy Interactive Official Game SiteCriminal Minds on the Criminal Minds WikiaAmerican Idol, titled American Idol: The Search for a Superstar for the first season, is a reality television singing competition created by Simon Fuller and produced by FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment. It began airing on Fox on June 11, 2002, as an addition to the Idol franchise based on the UK show Pop Idol, and has since become one of the most successful shows in the history of American television. It was the most watched TV series from 2005 to 2011 in the Nielsen ratings, and it is the only program to have been number one for seven consecutive seasons.[1]The concept of the series is to find new solo recording artists where the winner is determined by the viewers. Winners chosen by viewers through telephone, Internet, and SMS text voting were Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, Fantasia Barrino, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Hicks, Jordin Sparks, David Cook, Kris Allen, Lee DeWyze, Scotty McCreery and Phillip Phillips.The series employs a panel of judges who critique the contestants' performances. The original three judges were record producer and music manager Randy Jackson, pop singer and choreographer Paula Abdul and music executive and manager Simon Cowell. The upcoming season 12's judging panel consists of Jackson, R&B singer Mariah Carey, hip hop artist Nicki Minaj, and country singer Keith Urban. The series is emceed by radio personality Ryan Seacrest.The series was described by a rival TV executive as "the most impactful show in the history of television."[2] It has also become a recognized springboard for launching the career of many artists as bona fide stars. According to Billboard, in its first ten years, "Idol has spawned 345 Billboard chart-toppers and a platoon of pop idols, including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Daughtry, Fantasia, Ruben Studdard, Jennifer Hudson, Clay Aiken, Adam Lambert and Jordin Sparks while remaining TV ratings juggernaut."[3]American Idol was created based on the British show Pop Idol, which was in turn inspired by Popstars, a show TV producer Nigel Lythgoe saw in Australia and brought over to Britain.[4] Using the idea from Popstars of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition, then adding other elements such as telephone voting by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows such as the Eurovision Song Contest) and the drama of backstories and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time, Simon Fuller then created Pop Idol.[5] The show debuted in 2001 in Britain with Lythgoe as the producer and Simon Cowell as one of the judges, and was a big success with the viewing public.[6]Fuller and Cowell attempted to sell the Pop Idol format to the U.S. in 2001, but the idea was met with poor response from U.S. TV networks.[7] However, Rupert Murdoch, head of Fox's parent company, was persuaded to buy the show by his daughter Elisabeth, who was a fan of the British show.[7] The show was renamed American Idol: The Search for a Superstar and debuted in the summer of 2002, and became one of the summer hit shows that year.[8][9] The show, with the personal engagement of the viewers with the contestants through voting, and the presence of the caustic-tongue judge Simon Cowell, grew into a phenomenon. By 2004 it had become the biggest show on U.S. TV, a position it then held on for seven straight years. Unless renewed, the show is scheduled to remain on air until 2013.[10]The show had originally planned on having four judges following the Pop Idol format, however only three judges had been found by the time of the audition round in the first season, namely Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell.[7] A fourth judge, radio DJ Stryker, was originally chosen but he dropped out citing "image concerns".[11] In the second season, New York radio personality Angie Martinez had been hired as a fourth judge but withdrew only after a few days of auditions due to not being comfortable with giving out criticism.[12] The show decided to continue with the three judges format until season eight. All three original judges stayed on the judging panel for eight seasons.In season eight, Latin Grammy Award-nominated singersongwriter and record producer Kara DioGuardi was added as a fourth judge. She stayed for two seasons and left the show before season ten.[13] Paula Abdul left the show before season nine after failing to agree terms with the show producers.[14] Emmy Award-winning talk show host Ellen DeGeneres replaced Paula Abdul for that season, but left after just one season.[15] On January 11, 2010, Simon Cowell announced that he was leaving the show to pursue introducing the American version of his show The X Factor to the USA for 2011.[16] On September 22, 2010, it was announced that Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler would join the judging panel.[17] Both Tyler and Lopez left after two seasons as judges.[18]On July 23, 2012, it was announced that recording artist Mariah Carey would be joining the show as a judge for season twelve.[19] On September 16, 2012, it was confirmed that Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj would join Carey and Jackson at the panel.[20]Guest judges may occasionally be introduced. In season two, guest judges such as Lionel Richie and Robin Gibb were used, and in season three Donna Summer, Quentin Tarantino and some of the mentors also joined as judges to critique the performances in the final rounds. Guest judges were used in the audition rounds for seasons four, six and nine, such as Gene Simmons and LL Cool J in season four, Jewel and Olivia Newton-John in season six, and Neil Patrick Harris, Shania Twain, Victoria Beckham, Avril Lavigne and Katy Perry in season nine.The first season was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman. Dunkleman quit thereafter,[21] making Seacrest the sole emcee of the show ever since.In a series of steps, the show selects the eventual winner out of many tens of thousands of contestants.The eligible age-range for contestants is currently fifteen to twenty-eight years old. The initial age limit was sixteen to twenty-four in the first three seasons, but the upper limit was raised to twenty-eight in season four, and the lower limit was reduced to fifteen in season ten. The contestants must be legal U.S. residents, cannot have advanced to particular stages of the competition in previous seasons (varies depending on the season, currently by the semi-final stage), and must not hold any current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage[22] (in previous years by the audition stage).[23]Contestants go through at least three sets of cuts. The first is a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. Although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these make it past the preliminary round of auditions. Successful auditions then sing in front of producers where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on television.[24] Those selected by the judges are sent to Hollywood. Between 1060 people in each city may make it to Hollywood.Once in Hollywood, the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds. Until season ten, there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood. In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants put themselves in small groups and perform a song together. In the final round, the contestants perform solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a banddepending on the season. In seasons two and three, contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round. In season seven, the group round was eliminated and contestants may, after a first solo performance and on judges approval, skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round.Starting in season ten, a further round was added in Las Vegas where the contestants perform in groups based on a theme, followed by one final solo round to determine the semi-finalists. At the end of this stage of the competition, 24 to 36 contestants are selected to move on to the semi-final stage.From the semifinal onwards, the fate of the contestants is decided by public vote. During the contestant's performance as well as the recap at the end, a toll-free telephone number for each contestant is displayed on the screen. For a two-hour period after the episode ends (up to four hours for the finale) in each US time zone, viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant's telephone number, and each call or text message is registered as a vote for that contestant. Viewers are allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window, however, the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialer.[25] One or more of the least popular contestants may be eliminated in successive weeks until a winner emerges. Over 110million votes were cast in the first season, and by season ten the seasonal total had increased to nearly 750 million. Voting via text messaging was made available in the second season when AT&T Wireless joined as a sponsor of the show, and 7.5million text messages were sent to American Idol that season.[26] The number of text messages rapidly increased, reaching 178million texts by season eight.[27] Online voting was offered for the first time in season ten. The votes are counted and verified by Telescope Inc.[28]In the first three seasons, as well as season eight, ten and eleven, the semi-finalists were split into different groups to perform individually in their respective night. In season one, there were three groups of ten, with the top three contestants from each group making the finals. In seasons two and three, there were four groups of eight, and the top two of each selected. In season eight there were three groups of twelve, with three contestants moving forward  the highest male, the highest female, and the next highest-placed singer. In season ten and eleven, the girls and boys perform on separate nights and five of each were chosen. These six seasons also featured a wildcard round where contestants who failed to qualify were given another chance. In season one, only one wildcard contestant was chosen by the judges, giving a total of ten finalists. In seasons two and three, each of the three judges championed one contestant with the public advancing a fourth into the finals, making 12 finalists in all. In season eight, four were chosen by the judges to produce a final 13. In season ten and eleven, three wildcards were chosen, again making a total of 13.From seasons four to seven and nine, the twenty-four semi-finalists were divided by gender in order to ensure an equal gender division in the top twelve. The men and women sang separately on consecutive nights, and the bottom two in each groups were eliminated each week until only six of each remained to form the top twelve.The finals are broadcast in prime time from CBS Television City in Los Angeles, in front of a live studio audience. The finals lasted eight weeks in season one, eleven weeks in subsequent seasons until seasons ten and eleven which lasted twelve weeks. Each finalist performs songs based on a weekly theme which may be a musical genre such as Motown, disco, or big band, songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley or The Beatles, or more generic themes such as Billboard Number 1 hits or songs from the contestant's year of birth. Contestants usually work with a celebrity mentor related to the theme. In season ten, Jimmy Iovine was brought in as a mentor for the season. Initially the contestants sing one song each week, but this is increased to two songs from top four or five onwards, then three songs for the top two or three.The most popular contestants are usually not revealed in the results show, instead typically the three contestants (two in later rounds) who received the lowest number of votes are called to the center of the stage. One of these three is sent to safety, the two remaining however need not both be ones with the fewest votes.[29] The contestant with the fewest votes is then revealed and eliminated from the competition. A montage of the eliminated contestant is played and they give their final performance. However, starting in season eight, the judges may overturn viewers' decision with a "Judges' Save"  they can save a contestant on a unanimous decision, but two will be eliminated the following week, except for season 11 when only one was sent home after the save. The save can only be used once, and only before top five.In the finale, the two remaining contestants perform to determine the winner. For the first six seasons, apart from season two, the finale was broadcast from the Kodak Theatre, which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400. The finale for season two took place at the Gibson Amphitheatre, which has an audience capacity of over 6,000. From season seven onwards, the venue was changed to the Nokia Theatre, which holds an audience of over 7,000. A special two-hour results show the next night follows where the winner is announced at the end.The winner receives a record deal with a major label, which may be for up to six albums,[30][31] and secures a management contract with American Idol-affiliated 19 Management (which has the right of first refusal to sign all contestants), as well as various lucrative contracts. All winners prior to Season 9 reportedly earned at least $1million in their first year as winner.[31] All the runners-up of the first ten seasons, as well as some of other finalists, have also received record deals with major labels. However, starting in season 11, the runner-up may only be guaranteed a single-only deal.[32] BMG/Sony (season 1-9) and UMG (season 10- ) had the right of first refusal to sign contestants for three months after the season's finale. Prominent music mogul Clive Davis also produced some of the selected contestants' albums, such as Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo. All top 10 (11 in season 10) finalists earn the privilege of going on a tour where the participants may each earn a six-figure sum.[33]Each season premieres with the audition round, taking place in different cities. The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists, interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants. Each successful contestant receives a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood. Based on their performances during the Hollywood round (Las Vegas round for seasons 10 onwards), 24 to 36 contestants are selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals. From the semifinal onwards the contestants perform their songs live, with the judges making their critiques after each performance. The contestants are voted for by the viewing public, and the outcome of the public votes is then revealed in the results show typically on the following night. The results shows feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers. The Top-three results show also features the homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists. The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show where the winner of the season is revealed.With the exception of seasons one and two, the contestants in the semifinals onwards perform in front of a studio audience. They perform with a full band in the finals. From season four to season nine, the American Idol band was led by Rickey Minor; from season ten onwards, Ray Chew. Assistance may also be given by vocal coaches and song arrangers, such as Michael Orland and Debra Byrd to contestants behind the scene. Starting with season seven, contestants may perform with a musical instrument from the Hollywood rounds onwards. In the first nine seasons, performances were usually aired live on Tuesday nights, followed by the results shows on Wednesdays in the United States and Canada, but moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays in season ten.The first season of American Idol debuted as a summer replacement show in June 2002 on the Fox network. It was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman.In the audition rounds, 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions. These were cut to 30 for the semifinal, with ten going on to the finals. One semifinalist, Delano Cagnolati, was disqualified for lying to escape the show's age cutoff. One of the early favorites to win the show, Tamyra Gray, was eliminated at the top four, the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons. Christina Christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations, and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital.[34] Jim Verraros was the first openly gay contestant on the show; his sexual orientation was revealed in his online journal, however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes.[35]The final showdown was between Justin Guarini, one of the favorites, and Kelly Clarkson. Clarkson was not initially thought of as a contender,[36] but impressed the judges with some good performances in the final rounds, such as her performance of Aretha Franklin's "Natural Woman", and Betty Hutton's "Stuff Like That There", and eventually won the crown on September 4, 2002.In what was to become a tradition, Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale, and released the song immediately after the season ended. The single, "A Moment Like This", went on to break a 38-year-old record held by The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Justin Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so. Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film, From Justin to Kelly, which was released in 2003 but was widely panned. Clarkson has since become the most successful Idol contestant around the world, with worldwide album sales of more than 23million.[37]Starting September 30, 2006, this season was repackaged as "American Idol Rewind" and syndicated directly to stations in the US.Following the success of season one, the second season was moved up to air in January 2003. The number of episodes increased, as did the show's budget and the charge for commercial spots. Dunkleman left the show, leaving Seacrest as the lone host. Kristin Adams was originally announced as a co-host,[38] but her role was reduced to special correspondent upon airing.Corey Clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record, however, he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion. Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair. The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation.[39] Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year  Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge, and Frenchie Davis for having previously modelled for an adult website.[40]Ruben Studdard emerged as the winner, beating Clay Aiken by a small margin. Out of a total of 24 million votes, Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Clay Aiken. This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through.[41] In an interview prior to season five, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale.[42]Both finalists were successful after the show, but Clay Aiken out-performed Ruben's coronation song "Flying Without Wings" with his single release from the show "This Is the Night", as well as in their subsequent album releases. The fourth-place finisher Josh Gracin also enjoyed some success as a country singer.Season three premiered on January 19, 2004. One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was William Hung whose off-key rendition of Ricky Martin's "She Bangs" received widespread attention. His exposure on Idol landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the third best-selling singer from that season.[43]Much media attention on the season had been focused on the three black singers, Fantasia Barrino, LaToya London, and Jennifer Hudson, dubbed the Three Divas. All three unexpectedly landed on the bottom three on the top seven result show, with Jennifer Hudson controversially eliminated.[44] Elton John, who was one of the mentors that season, called the results of the votes "incredibly racist."[45] The prolonged stays of John Stevens and Jasmine Trias in the finals, despite negative comments from the judges, had aroused resentment, so much so that John Stevens reportedly received a death threat, which he dismissed as a joke 'blown out of proportion'.[46]The performance of "Summertime" by Fantasia Barrino, later known simply as "Fantasia", at Top 8 was widely praised, and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite Idol moment in the nine seasons he was on the show.[47] Fantasia and Diana DeGarmo were the last two finalists remaining at the finale, and Fantasia was crowned as the winner. Fantasia released as her coronation single "I Believe", a song co-written by season one finalist Tamyra Gray, and Diana DeGarmo released "Dreams". Fantasia went on to gain some successes as a recording artist, whilst Jennifer Hudson, who placed seventh became the only Idol-contestant so far to win both an Academy Award and a Grammy.Season four premiered on January 18, 2005; this was the first season of the series to be aired in high definition, although the finale of season three was also aired in high definition. The number of those attending the auditions by now had increased to over 100,000 from the 10,000 of the first season. The age limit was raised to 28 in this season,[23] among those who benefited from this new rule were Constantine Maroulis and Bo Bice, "the two rockers" of the show. The presence of more rock-oriented contestants inspired more rock musicians to audition in later seasons, such as Chris Daughtry in season five.The top 12 finalists originally included Mario Vazquez, but he dropped out citing 'personal reasons'[48] and was replaced by Nikko Smith. Later, an employee of Freemantle Media which produces the show sued the company for wrongful termination, claiming that he was dismissed after complaining about lewd behavior by Mario Vazquez toward him during the show.[49]At top 11, due to a mix-up with the contestants' telephone number, voting was repeated on what was normally the result night, with the result reveal postponed until the following night.In May 2005, Carrie Underwood was announced to be the winner, with Bo Bice the runner-up. Both Carrie Underwood and Bo Bice released the coronation song "Inside Your Heaven". Carrie Underwood has since become the most successful Idol contestant in the U.S. in terms of album sales, selling over 13million units.Season five began on January 17, 2006. It remains the highest-rated season in the show's run so far. Two of the more prominent contestants during the Hollywood round were the Brittenum twins who were later disqualified for identity theft.[50]Chris Daughtry's performance of Fuel's "Hemorrhage (In My Hands)" on the show was widely praised and led to an invitation to join the band as Fuel's new lead singer, an invitation he declined.[51] His performance of Live's version of "I Walk the Line" was well received by the judges but later criticized in some quarters for not crediting the arrangement to Live.[52] He was eliminated at the top four in a shock result.On May 30, 2006, Taylor Hicks was named American Idol, with Katharine McPhee the runner-up. "Do I Make You Proud" was released as Taylor Hicks' first single and "My Destiny" Katharine McPhee's. Katherine McPhee is currently starring in the TV series Smash.Despite being eliminated earlier than expected, Chris Daughtry a.k.a. Daughtry became the most successful recording artist from this season. Other contestants, such as Taylor Hicks, Katherine McPhee, Bucky Covington, Mandisa, Kellie Pickler, and Elliott Yamin have had varying levels of success. This season remains the most productive in the number of successful recording artists it generated.Season six began on Tuesday, January 16, 2007. The premiere drew a massive audience of 37.3million viewers, peaking in the last half hour with more than 41million viewers.[53]Teenager Sanjaya Malakar was the season's most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo,[54] and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog Vote for the Worst and satellite radio personality Howard Stern, who both encouraged fans to vote for him. However, on April 18, Sanjaya was voted off.[55] Semi-finalist Antonella Barba also drew some attention due to racy photographs of her which emerged during the show.This season saw the first ever Idol Gives Back telethon-inspired event, which raised more than $76million in corporate and viewer donations.[56] No contestant was eliminated that week, but two, Phil Stacey and Chris Richardson, were eliminated the next. Melinda Doolittle, an early favorite, was eliminated on top three.On the May 23, 2007 season finale, Jordin Sparks was declared the winner against runner-up Blake Lewis. Sparks has enjoyed some success as a recording artist post-Idol.This season also saw the launch of the American Idol Songwriter contest which allowed fans to vote for the "coronation song". Thousands of recordings of original songs were submitted by songwriters, and 20 entries selected for the public vote. The winning song, "This Is My Now", was performed by both finalists during the finale and released by the winner Jordin Sparks on May 24, 2007.Season seven premiered on January 15, 2008, for a two-day, four-hour premiere. The media focused on the professional status of the season seven contestants, the so-called 'ringers',[57] many of whom had prior records deals, such as Kristy Lee Cook, Brooke White, Michael Johns, and in particular Carly Smithson.[58] Contestant David Hernandez also attracted some attention due to his past working as a stripper.[59]For the finals, American Idol debuted a new state-of-the-art set and stage on March 11, 2008, along with a new on-air look. David Cook's performance of "Billie Jean" on top ten night was lauded by the judges, but provoked controversy when they apparently mistook the Chris Cornell arrangement to be David Cook's own even though the performance was introduced as Cornell's version. Cornell himself said he was 'flattered' and praised David Cook's performance.[60] David Cook was taken to the hospital after the top nine performance show due to heart palpitations and high blood pressure.[61]David Archuleta's performance of John Lennon's "Imagine" was considered by many as one of the best of the season. Jennifer Lopez, who was brought in as a judge in season ten, cited it as a beautiful-song moment that she will never forget.[62] Jason Castro's semi-final performance of "Hallelujah" also received considerable attention, and it propelled Jeff Buckley's version of the song to the top of the Billboard digital song chart.[63] This is the first season whereby contestants' recordings were released onto iTunes after their performances, and although sales information were not released so as not to prejudice the contest, leaked information indicated contestants' songs frequently reached the top of iTunes sales chart.[64]Idol Gives Back returned on April 9, 2008, and raised $64million for charity.[56] The finalists were David Cook and David Archuleta, the first time in the show's history where neither of the top two were ever in the bottom three. David Cook was announced the winner of American Idol season seven on May 21, 2008, the first 'rocker' to win the show.The American Idol Songwriter contest was also held this season. From ten of the most popular submissions, each of the final two contestants chose a song to perform, although neither of their selections was used as the "coronation song". The winning song, "The Time of My Life", was recorded by David Cook and released on May 22, 2008. Both David Cook and David Archuleta were successful as recording artists.Season eight began on January 13, 2009. Mike Darnell, the president of alternative programming for Fox, stated that the season would focus more on the contestants' reality and emotional state,[65] much early attention on the show was therefore focused on the widowerhood of Danny Gokey as well as characters like Tatiana Del Toro and Nick Mitchell.In the first major change to the judging panel, a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi, was introduced; Paula Abdul, however, left the show after the season ended. This was also the first season without executive producer Nigel Lythgoe who left to focus on the international versions of his show So You Think You Can Dance.[66] The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and was also extended to two weeks. Idol Gives Back was cancelled for this season due to the global recession at the time.There were 13 finalists this season, but two were eliminated in its first result show of the finals. A new feature introduced was the "Judges' Save", and Matt Giraud was saved from elimination at the top seven by the judges when he received the fewest votes. The next week, Lil Rounds and Anoop Desai were eliminated.The two finalists were Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, both of whom had previously landed in the bottom three at the top five. Kris Allen won the contest in the most controversial voting result since season two. It was claimed,[67] later retracted,[68] that 38million of the 100million votes cast on the night came from Kris Allen's home state of Arkansas alone, and that AT&T employees unfairly influenced the votes by giving lessons on power-texting at viewing parties in Arkansas.[69]Both Kris Allen and Adam Lambert released the coronation song, "No Boundaries" which was co-written by DioGuardi. This is the first season in which the winner has failed to achieve gold album status, and none from that season achieved platinum album status in the US.Season nine premiered on January 12, 2010. The upheaval at the judging panel continued. Ellen DeGeneres joined as a judge to replace Paula Abdul at the start of Hollywood Week, however, she left after the season finished, as did Simon Cowell who left to launch the US version of The X Factor. Kara DioGuardi's contract was not renewed for the next season.One of the most prominent auditioners that season was General Larry Platt whose performance of "Pants on the Ground" became a viral hit song.[70]Crystal Bowersox, who has Type-I diabetes, fell ill due to diabetic ketoacidosis on the morning of the girls performance night for the top 20 week and was hospitalized.[71] The schedule was rearranged so the boys performed first and she could perform the following night instead; she later revealed that Ken Warwick, the show producer, wanted to disqualify her but she begged to be allowed to stay on the show.[71]Michael Lynche was the lowest vote getter at top nine and was given the Judges' Save. The next week Katie Stevens and Andrew Garcia were eliminated. That week Adam Lambert was invited back to be a mentor, the first Idol alum to do so. Idol Gives Back returned this season on April 21, 2010, and raised 45 million.[56]A special tribute to Simon Cowell was presented in the finale for his final season with the show. Many figures from the show's past, including Paula Abdul, made an appearance.This was the second season where neither of the final two contestants, Lee DeWyze and Crystal Bowersox, had been in the bottom two or three. Lee DeWyze was declared the winner during the May 26 finale. No new song was used as coronation song this year; instead, the two finalists each released a cover song  Lee DeWyze chose U2's "Beautiful Day", and Crystal Bowersox chose Patty Griffin's "Up to the Mountain". This is the first season where neither finalist achieved significant album sales.Season ten of the series premiered on January 19, 2011. Many changes were introduced this season, from the format to the personnel of the show. Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined Randy Jackson as judges,[17] while Nigel Lythgoe returned as executive producer. Jimmy Iovine, chairman of the Interscope Geffen A&M label group, the new partner of American Idol, acted as the in-house mentor in place of weekly guest mentors,[17] although in later episodes special guest mentors such as Beyonc, will.i.am and Lady Gaga were brought in.Season ten is the first to include online auditions where contestants could submit a 40 second video audition via Myspace.[72] Karen Rodriguez was one such auditioner and reached the final rounds.One of the more prominent contestants this year was Chris Medina, whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fiance received widespread coverage. Medina was cut in the Top 40 round. Casey Abrams, who suffers from ulcerative colitis, was hospitalized twice and missed the Top 13 result show. The judges used their one save on Abrams in the Top 11, and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10. Also, following the judges using their save, Naima Adedapo and Thia Megia were both eliminated the following week.Pia Toscano, one of the presumed favorites to advance far in the season, was unexpectedly eliminated on April 7, 2011, finishing in ninth place. Her elimination drew criticism from some former Idol contestants, as well as actor Tom Hanks.[73]The two finalists in 2011 were Lauren Alaina and Scotty McCreery, both teenage country singers. McCreery won the competition on May 25, 2011, being the youngest male winner and the fourth male in a row to win American Idol. McCreery released his first single, "I Love You This Big", as his coronation song, and Alaina released "Like My Mother Does". McCreery's debut album, Clear as Day, became the first debut album by an Idol winner to reach number one on the US Billboard 200 since Ruben Studdard's Soulful in 2003.[74]Season 11 premiered on January 18, 2012. On February 23, it was announced that one more finalist would join the Top 24 making it the Top 25, and that was Jermaine Jones. However, on March 14, Jones was disqualified in 12th place for concealing arrests and outstanding warrants.[75] Jones however denied concealing his arrests.Finalist Phillip Phillips suffered from kidney pain and was taken to hospital before the Top 13 results show, and later received medical procedure to alleviate a blockage caused by kidney stones.[76] He was reported to have eight surgeries during his Idol run, and had considered quitting the show due to the pain.[77] He underwent surgery to remove the stones and reconstruct his kidney soon after the season had finished.[78]Jessica Sanchez received the fewest number of votes during the Top 7 week, and the judges decided to use their "save" option on her, making her the first female recipient of the save. The following week, Colton Dixon was the only contestant sent home, as opposed to two finalists as in previous seasons. Jessica Sanchez later made it to the final two (the first season where a recipient of the save reached the finale).Phillip Phillips eventually won the season 11, beating Jessica Sanchez in a new world record of 132 million votes. Prior to the announcement of the winner, season five finalist Ace Young proposed marriage to season three runner-up Diana DeGarmo on stage; a proposal DeGarmo accepted.Phillips released "Home" as his coronation song, while Sanchez released "Change Nothing". Phillips' "Home" has since became the best selling of all coronation songs.[79]Judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler left the show after two seasons. This season's judging panel consists of Randy Jackson, along with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj. This was the first season since season nine to have four judges on the panel.Since the show's inception in 2002, eight of the eleven Idol winners, including its first five, have come from the Southern United States.[80] The three exceptions are: Jordin Sparks, who hails from Arizona; David Cook, hails from Missouri (which is considered part of the "Upland South",[81] and he was born in Houston and living in Tulsa at the time of his audition); and Lee DeWyze from Illinois. A large number of other notable finalists during the series' run have also hailed from the American South, including Clay Aiken, Kellie Pickler and Chris Daughtry, who are all from North Carolina.[80] In 2012, an analysis of the 131 contestants who have appeared in the finals of all seasons of the show up to that point found that 48% have some connection to the Southern United States.[82]The show itself is popular in the Southern United States, with households in the Southeastern United States 10% more likely to watch American Idol during the eighth season in 2009, and those in the East Central region, such as Kentucky, were 16 percent more likely to tune into the series.[80] Data from Nielsen SoundScan, a music-sales tracking service, showed that of the 47million CDs sold by Idol contestants through January 2010, 85 percent were by contestants with ties to the American South.[80]Theories given for the success of Southerners on Idol have been: more versatility with musical genres, as the Southern U.S. is home to several music genre scenes; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business; text-voting due to the South having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households; and the strong heritage of music and singing, which is notable in the Bible Belt, where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing.[80][83][84] Others also suggest that the Southern character of these contestants appeal to the South, as well as local pride.[85] According to season five winner Taylor Hicks, who is from the state of Alabama, "People in the South have a lot of pride ... So, they're adamant about supporting the contestants who do well from their state or region."[80]For five consecutive seasons, starting in season seven, the title has been given to a white male who plays the guitar  a trend that Idol pundits call the "White guy with guitar" or "WGWG" factor.[86][87] Just hours before the season eleven finale, where Phillip Phillips was named the winner, Richard Rushfield, author of the book American Idol: The Untold Story, said, You have this alliance between young girls and grandmas and they see it, not necessarily as a contest to create a pop star competing on the contemporary radio, but aswhos the nicest guy in a popularity contest, he says, And that has led to this dynasty of four, and possibly now five, consecutive, affable, very nice, good-looking white boys.[87]The show had been criticized in earlier seasons over the onerous contract contestants had to sign that gave excessive control to 19 Entertainment over their future career,[88] and handed a large part of their future earnings to the management.[89][90]Individual contestants have generated controversy in this competition for their past actions,[40][91] or for being 'ringers' planted by the producers.[57] A number of contestants had been disqualified for various reasons, such as for having an existing contract or undisclosed criminal records, although the show had been accused of double standard for disqualifying some but not the others.[92]Voting results have been a consistent source of controversy. The mechanism of voting had also aroused considerable criticisms, most notably in season two when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote,[41] and in season eight, when the massive increase in text votes (100million more text votes than season 7)[27] fueled the texting controversy.[69] Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the very first season.[93] Since 2004, votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online community services such as DialIdol and Vote for the Worst.Idol Gives Back is a special charity event started in season six featuring performances by celebrities and various fund-raising initiatives. This event was also held in seasons seven and nine and has raised nearly $185million in total.[56]Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of American Idol. It is one of the highest-rated TV shows in the history of television.American Idol premiered in June 2002 and became the surprise summer hit show of 2002. The first show drew 9.9million viewers, giving Fox the best viewing figure for the 8.30pm spot in over a year.[114] The audience steadily grew, and by finale night, the audience had averaged 23million, with more than 40million watching some part of that show.[115] That episode was placed third amongst all age groups, but more importantly it led in the 1849 demographic, the age group most valued by advertisers.[9]The growth continued into the next season, starting with a season premiere of 26.5 million.[94] The season attracted an average of 21.7million viewers, and was placed second overall amongst the 1849 age group.[116] The finale night when Ruben Studdard won over Clay Aiken was also the highest-rated ever American Idol episode at 38.1million for the final hour.[117] By season three, the show had become the top show in the 1849 demographic[117] a position it has held for all subsequent years up to and including season ten. By season four, American Idol had become the most watched series amongst all viewers on American TV, with an average viewership of 26.8million.[118] The show reached its peak in season five with numbers averaging 30.6million.[118]Season six started with some the most watched ever episodes of American Idol, and many television executives had by then begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before,[2] as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as The Cosby Show. The show was dubbed "the Death Star",[53] and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses.[2] However, season six also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season. The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16% from the previous year.[117]The loss of viewers continued into season seven. The premiere was down 11% among total viewers,[94] and the results show in which Kristy Lee Cook was eliminated delivered its lowest-rated Wednesday show among the 1834 demo since the first season in 2002.[119] However, the ratings rebounded for the season seven finale with the excitement over the battle of the Davids, and improved over season six as the third most watched finale. The strong finish of season seven also helped Fox become the most popular TV network for the first time since its inception.[120] Overall ratings for the season were down 10% from season six,[121] General attrition of television audiences may be a reason for this ratings decline, which is in line with the fall in viewership across all networks due in part to the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike.[122]The declining trend however continued into season eight, as total viewers numbers fell by 510% for early episodes compared to season seven,[123] and by 9% for the finale.[95] In season nine, Idol's six-year extended streak of perfection in the ratings was broken, when NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics on February 17 beat Idol in the same time slot with 30.1million viewers over Idol's 18.4million.[124] Nevertheless, American Idol finished its ninth season as the most watched TV series for the sixth year running, breaking the previous record of five consecutive seasons achieved by CBS' All in the Family and NBC's The Cosby Show.[125]In season ten, the total viewer numbers for the first week of shows fell 1213%, and by up to 23% in the 1849 demo compared to season nine.[108] Later episodes, however, retained viewers better, and by Top 8, the season-to-date total viewership was up from Season 9.[126] The season ended on a high with a significant increase in viewership for the finale  up 12% for the adults 1849 demo and a 21% increase in total viewers from the season nine finale.[127] While the overall viewer number has increased this season, its viewer demographics have continued to age year on year  the median age this season was 47.2 compared to a median age of 32.1 in its first season.[128]Season eleven, however, suffered a steep drop in ratings, a drop attributed by some to the arrival of new shows such as The Voice and The X-Factor.[129] The ratings for the first two episodes of season eleven fell 1621% in overall viewer numbers and 2427% in the 18/49 demo.[111] The season eleven finale was seen by 21.5 million viewers and had a 6.4 demo rating, representing in a drop of 30% year-over-year.[112] The average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers the first time since 2003, a drop of 23% in total viewers and 30% in the 18/49 demo. For the first time in eight years, American Idol lost the leading position in both the total viewers number and the 18/49 demo, coming in second to NBC Sunday Night Football.[113]The enormous success of the show and the revenue it generated was transformative for Fox Broadcasting Company.[130] The show pushed Fox to become the number one TV network amongst adult 1849,[131] the key demographic coveted by advertisers, for an unprecedented seven consecutive years by 2011.[132] Its success also helped lift the ratings of other shows that were scheduled around it such as House and Bones.[2] The show, its creator Simon Fuller claimed, "saved Fox".[133]It spawned a number of similar singing competition shows, such as Rock Star, Nashville Star, a relaunched Star Search, The Voice, although none have yet matched its success.[134][135] Its format also served as a blueprint for a generation of TV shows such as Dancing with the Stars, So You Think You Can Dance.[136]As one of the most successful shows on U.S. television history, American Idol has a strong impact not just on television, but also in the wider world of entertainment.[137] It helped create a number of highly successful recording artists, such as Kelly Clarkson, Daughtry and Carrie Underwood, as well as others of varying notability.Various American Idol alumni had success on various record charts around the world; in the U.S. they had achieved 345 number ones on the Billboard charts in its first ten years.[3] According to Fred Bronson, author of books on the Billboard charts, no other entity has ever created as many hit-making artists and best-selling albums and singles.[138] In 2007, American Idol was accounted for 2.1% of all music sales.[139] Its alumni have a massive impact on radio; in 2007, American Idol had become "a dominant force in radio" according to the president of the research company Mediabase which monitors radio stations Rich Meyer.[140] By 2010, four winners each had more than a million radio spins, with Kelly Clarkson leading the field with over four million spins.[141]As of 2012, the American Idol alumni in their post-Idol careers have amassed over 57million albums and 100million singles and digital track downloads in the United States alone.The impact of American Idol is also strongly felt in musical theatre, where many of Idol alumni have forged successful careers. The striking effect of former American Idol contestants on Broadway has been noted and commented on.[142][143] The casting of a popular Idol contestant can lead to significantly increased ticket sales. Other alumni have gone on to work in television and films, the most notable being Jennifer Hudson who, on the recommendation of the Idol vocal coach Debra Byrd,[144] won a role in Dreamgirls and subsequently received a Academy Award for her performance.Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that "As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential".[145] Others, however, thought that "the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed".[9] It was also described as a "sadistic musical bake-off",[146] and "a romp in humiliation".[147] Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted,[148] and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations  Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is "a conniving multimedia monster" that has "absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil."[149] The decision to send the season one winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted with satirical flair that "The terrorists have won" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who "gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome)."[150]Some of the later writers about the show were more positive, Michael Slezak, again of Entertainment Weekly, thought that "for all its bloated, synthetic, product-shilling, money-making trappings, Idol provides a once-a-year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today's music business."[151] Singer Sheryl Crow, who was later to act as a mentor on the show, however took the view that the show "undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism."[152] Pop music critic Ann Powers nevertheless suggested that Idol has "reshaped the American songbook", "led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture", and connects "the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future."[153] Others focused on the personalities in the show; Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek accused judge Simon Cowell's cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness, that "Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him."[154] Some such as singer John Mayer disparaged the contestants, suggesting that those who appeared on Idol are not real artists with self-respect.[155]Some in the entertainment industry were critical of the star-making aspect of the show. Usher, a mentor on the show, bemoaning the loss of the "true art form of music", thought that shows like American Idol made it seem "so easy that everyone can do it, and that it can happen overnight", and that "television is a lie".[156] Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers, said that American Idol "isn't really about music. It's about all the bad aspects of the music business  the arrogance of commerce, this sense of 'I know what will make this person a star; artists themselves don't know.' "[157] That American Idol is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry. LeAnn Rimes, commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in 2006, said that "Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award".[158] It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others. Elton John, who had appeared as a mentor in the show but turned down an offer to be a judge on American Idol, commenting on talent shows in general said that "there have been some good acts but the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs",[159] and Steven Tyler, appearing on Late Show with David Letterman on January 17, 2011 in a publicity drive as a judge for American Idol, said that "I've always thought that to be an American Idol or any kind of idol, you have to pay your dues, but today it's a different world."The success of the show's alumni however has led to a more positive assessment of the show, and the show was described as having "proven it has a valid way to pick talent and a proven way to sell records".[160] While the industry is divided on the show success, according to a CMT exec, reflecting on the success of Idol alumni in the country genre, "if you want to try and get famous fast by going to a cattle call audition on TV, Idol reasonably remains the first choice for anyone," and that country music and Idol "go together well."[161]American Idol has been nominated for the Emmy's Outstanding Reality Competition Program for nine years but never won.[162] Director Bruce Gower won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing For A Variety, Music Or Comedy Series in 2009, and the show won a Creative Arts Emmys each in 2007 and 2008, three in 2009, and two in 2011, as well as a Governor's Award in 2007 for its Idol Gives Back edition. It won the People's Choice Award, which honors the popular culture of the previous year as voted by the public, for favorite competition/reality show in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2012.[163] It won the first Critics' Choice Television Award in 2011 for Best Reality Competition.[164]The dominance of American Idol in the ratings has made it the most profitable show in U.S. TV for many years. The show was estimated to generate $900million for the year 2004 through sales of TV ads, albums, merchandise and concert tickets.[133] By season seven, the show was estimated to earn around $900million from its ad revenue alone, not including ancillary sponsorship deals and other income.[165][166] One estimate puts the total TV revenue for the first eight seasons of American at $6.4billion.[167] Sponsors that bought fully integrated packages can expect a variety of promotions of their products on the show, such as product placement, adverts and product promotion integrated into the show, and various promotional opportunities.[168] Other off-air promotional partners pay for the rights to feature "Idol" branding on their packaging, products and marketing programs.[169] American Idol also partnered with Disney in its theme park attraction The American Idol Experience.American Idol became the most expensive series on broadcast networks for advertisers starting season four,[170] and by the next season, it had broken the record in advertising rate for a regularly scheduled prime-time network series, selling over $700,000 for a 30-seconds slot,[171] and reaching up to $1.3million for the finale.[172] Its ad prices reached a peak in season seven at $737,000.[166] Estimated revenue more than doubled from $404million in season three to $870million in season six.[173] While that declined from season eight onwards, it still earned significantly more than its nearest competitor,[174][175] with advertising revenue topping $800million annually the next few seasons.[176] However, the sharp drop in ratings in season eleven also resulted in a sharp drop in advertising rate for season twelve, and the show lost its leading position as the costliest show for advertisers.[177]Ford Motor Company and Coca-Cola were two of the first sponsors of American Idol in its first season. The sponsorship deal cost around $10million in season one,[178] rising to $35million by season 7,[169] and between $50 to $60 million in season 10.[179] The third major sponsor AT&T Wireless joined in the second season. iTunes joined in season seven.American Idol prominent display of its sponsors' logo and products had been noted since the early seasons.[9][115] By season six, Idol showed 4,349 product placements according to Nielsen Media Research.[180] The branded entertainment integration had proved beneficial to its advertisers  promotion of AT&T text-messaging as a means to vote successfully introduced the technology into the wider culture,[26][181] and Coca-Cola has seen its equity increased during the show.[182]Coca-Cola's archrival PepsiCo declined to sponsor American Idol at the show's start. What the Los Angeles Times later called "missing one of the biggest marketing opportunities in a generation" contributed to Pepsi losing market share, by 2010 falling to third place from second in the United States. PepsiCo sponsors the American version of Cowell's The X Factor in hopes of not repeating its Idol mistake.[186]The top ten (eleven in season ten) toured at the end of every season. Kellogg's Pop-Tarts was the sponsor for the first seven seasons, and Guitar Hero was added for the season seven tour. M&M's Pretzel Chocolate Candies was a sponsor of the season nine tour. The season five tour was the most successful tour with gross of over $35million.[187]American Idol has traditionally released studio recordings of contestants' performances as well as the winner's coronation single for sale. For the first five seasons, the recordings were released as a compilation album at the end of the season. All five of these albums reached the top ten in Billboard 200 which made then American Idol the most successful soundtrack franchise of any motion picture or television program.[188] Starting late in season five, individual performances were released during the season as digital downloads, initially from the American Idol official website only. In season seven the live performances and studio recordings were made available during the season from iTunes when it joined as a sponsor. In Season ten the weekly studio recordings were also released as compilation digital album straight after performance night.19 Recordings, a recording label owned by 19 Entertainment, currently hold the rights to phonographic material recorded by all the contestants. 19 originally partnered with Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG) to promote and distribute the recordings through its labels RCA Records, Arista Records, J Records, Jive Records. In 2005-2007, BMG partnered with Sony Music Entertainment to form a joint venture known as Sony BMG Music Entertainment. From 2008-2010, Sony Music handled the distribution following their acquisition of BMG. Sony Music was partnered with American Idol and distribute its music, and In 2010, Sony was replaced by as the music label for American Idol by UMG's Interscope-Geffen-A&M Records.[189]American Idol video gamesOn February 14, 2009, The Walt Disney Company debuted "The American Idol Experience" at its Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. In this live production, co-produced by 19 Entertainment, park guests choose from a list of songs and audition privately for Disney cast members. Those selected then perform on a stage in a 1000-seat theater replicating the Idol set. Three judges, whose mannerisms and style mimic those of the real Idol judges, critique the performances.[190] Audience members then vote for their favorite. There are several preliminary-round shows during the day that culminate in a "finals" show in the evening where one of the winners of previous rounds that day is selected as the overall winner.[191] The winner of the finals show receives a "Dream Ticket" that grants them front-of-the-line privileges at any American Idol audition.[190]American Idol is broadcast to over 100 nations outside of the United States.

The show is based on forensic anthropology and forensic archaeology, with each episode focusing on an FBI case file concerning the mystery behind human remains brought by FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) to the forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance "Bones" Brennan (Emily Deschanel). The rest of the main cast includes Michaela Conlin, T. J. Thyne, Eric Millegan, Tamara Taylor, Jonathan Adams, and John Francis Daley.Created by Hart Hanson, the series is very loosely based on the life and writings of novelist and forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs,[1] who also produces the show. Its title character, Temperance Brennan, is named after the protagonist of Reichs' crime novel series. Conversely, Dr. Brennan writes successful mystery novels based around a fictional (in the Bones universe) forensic anthropologist named Kathy Reichs. Bones is a joint production by Josephson Entertainment, Far Field Productions and 20th Century Fox Television.[2]Fox renewed Bones for an eighth season,[3] which premiered on September 17, 2012.The premise of the show is based on an alliance between forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance "Bones" Brennan and FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth. Brennan is the central character and team leader of the fictional Jeffersonian Institute Forensic Sciences Department. The show revolves around solving Federal legal cases by examining the human remains of possible murder victims. Dr. Brennan and her team provide scientific expertise and Special Agent Booth provides FBI criminal investigation technique. In addition to the prospective murder cases featured in each episode the series explores the backgrounds and relationships of its recurrent characters. An important ongoing dynamic between Brennan and Booth is their disagreement about science and faith. Brennan argues for science, evidence, and atheism. Booth argues for faith, God, and the unproven. The series is also known for its dark comedic undertones to, in essence, lighten the gravity of the show's intense subject matter.The concept of Bones was developed during the latter part of the pitching season of 2004 when 20th Century Fox approached series creator Hart Hanson with an idea for a forensics show. Hanson was asked to meet with executive producer Barry Josephson, who had purchased the rights to produce a documentary on the forensic anthropologist and author Kathy Reichs. Although Hanson was reluctant about being involved in making a police procedural, he signed on and wrote the pilot episode after having an intensive meeting with Josephson about the show.[5] As the show is based on the works of Reichs, the writers constantly involve her in the process of producing the episodes' storylines. Although the show's main character is also loosely based on Reichs, producers decided to name her Temperance Brennan, after the character in Reichs' novels;[1] Reichs has stated that she views the show as somewhat of a prequel to her novels, with the TV show's Temperance Brennan as a younger version of the novels' Temperance Brennan.[6]In order to make Bones a unique crime drama in the midst of the multiple procedural dramas that already populated network television like the Law & Order and CSI franchises, Hanson decided to infuse the show with as much dark humor and character development as possible.[7] Another element conceived for the show was the "Angelator", a holographic projector that provides a way to replace the flashbacks often used by other procedural shows. In addition to their expositional purposes, the holographic images, which are created by visual effects, brought a unique visual style to the show that the producers were looking for.[8]David Boreanaz was the first actor to be cast in Bones. Series creator Hart Hanson described the actors who had auditioned for the role of Seeley Booth as "pretty boy waifs" and immediately responded when the head of the studio, Dana Walden, suggested Boreanaz for the role.[1] Boreanaz was offered the role but was unenthusiastic about getting involved after a difficult meeting with executive producers Barry Josephson and Hart Hanson, even though he thought the script was well written. However, after the producers contacted him again to convince him to accept the role, Boreanaz agreed to sign on and was cast as Seeley Booth.[8][9]Emily Deschanel was cast in the role of Temperance Brennan just before production began on the Bones pilot.[1] After Deschanel finished the film Glory Road, the film's producer Jerry Bruckheimer recommended that she audition for Bones.[10] Deschanel impressed Hart Hanson at her audition with her assertiveness. In a tense moment in the audition scene, David Boreanaz stepped closer to Deschanel. Deschanel held her ground rather than retreating. Hanson remarked that, in such a situation, "90% of actors would take a step back".[11] Deschanel was subsequently cast in the role.Beginning with Season 4, Zack Addy (played by Eric Millegan) was replaced by a succession of lab assistants: Wendell Bray (Michael Grant Terry), Colin Fisher (Joel Moore), Vincent Nigel-Murray (Ryan Cartwright), Arastoo Vaziri (Pej Vahdat), Clark Edison (Eugene Byrd) and Daisy Wick (Carla Gallo). OneScott Starett (played by Michael Badalucco, formerly of The Practice)is much older than the typical grad student.[12] Marisa Coughlan guest-starred in a few midseason episodes as FBI agent Payton Perotta, who was brought to the Jeffersonian as a temporary substitute for Booth when he was incapacitated.[13]Most of Bones is filmed in Los Angeles, California, despite the fact that the show is mainly set in Washington, D.C., where the fictional Jeffersonian Institute is located. The external shots are of the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles. The interiors of the Jeffersonian Institute were specially built on a large soundstage at the 20th Century Fox lot in Century City, Los Angeles, California.[14] The two-part fourth season premiere was filmed on location in London, United Kingdom.[15]The soundtrack album titled Bones: Original Television Soundtrack, produced by Maria Alonte McCoy and Billy Gottlieb, was released in 2008. It contains 13 songs recorded by popular artists for the show.[16]A consistent naming of the episodes occurs. Almost every episode title alliteratively alludes to how the victim is discovered in said episode, like "The Critic in the Cabernet" and "The Dwarf in the Dirt", or to the main plot device of the episode, like "The Hero in the Hold" and "The Change in the Game".Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of Bones.The series premiere of Bones attracted an average of 10.0 million viewers with 6.7% household share and 11% household rating. Bones finished first among the 18-to-49-year-old demographic and in total viewers in its Thursday 8:00pm ET timeslot.[25] New York described the show as "the best drama of the new network season" and a "sexed-up variation of all the CSIs".[26] Regarding the show's procedural structure, Entertainment Weekly notes that Bones has a "pretty standard Crossing Jordan/CSI-style framework" but holds up because of the chemistry between the two lead characters; "that old Sam-and-Diane, Maddie-and-David, Mulder-and-Scully opposites-attract stuff never feels standard when it's done right."[27]Following the broadcast of the series' third episode, Fox ordered a full season of Bones.[28] It was renewed for a second season after its strong performance in ratings in the timeslot following American Idol and on its own without the American Idol's lead-in audience.[29] Overall, the first season of Bones ranked 60th in viewership among prime-time shows and 53rd among the 18 to 49 year old demographic, with a seasonal average of 8.9 million viewers.[17]The second season premiere attracted 8.61 million viewers in its Wednesday 8:00pm timeslot, finishing second among the 18 to 49 years old demographic and first in total viewership with 6.7% household rating and 11% household share.[30] As a lead-in for American Idol, the second season finale of Bones obtained 10.88 million viewers with 3.5% household rating and 11% household share. It tied first in viewership among the 18 to 49 years old demographic with The Price Is Right Million Dollar Spectacular on CBS.[31] In the 2006-07 television season, Bones improved its ranking to 50th place in viewership among prime-time shows with 9.4 million viewers and was ranked 51st among the 18 to 49 year old demographic. The show improved its ranking during its third season, placing 51st overall. However, its overall viewership was down from the previous season, averaging 8.9 million, the same as in the first season. Viewership began to steadily increase with its fourth season.Bones premiered on September 13, 2005 on the Fox network and was broadcast weekly in the Tuesday 8:00pm ET timeslot before it was moved to the Wednesday 8:00pm ET timeslot in 2006. The first season finished on May 17, 2006 with a total of 22 episodes.The second season premiered on the Fox network on August 30, 2006 and retained its Wednesday 8:00pm ET timeslot. The second season finale was aired on May 16, 2007, ending its second season with 21 episodes.

This began on October 3, 2006 but access is restricted to residents from the United States only.[35] Bones is also available on their official website via Fox On Demand. In Canada, recent episodes are available on the Global TV website, and seasons 1 to 6 are on Netflix Canada.In October 2010, it was revealed that Fox was developing a potential spin-off series that would be built around a new recurring character that would be introduced in the sixth season. The potential spin-off series would also be created by Bones creator/executive producer Hart Hanson, and be based on The Locator series of two books written by Richard Greener. The character of Walter is described as an eccentric but amusing recluse in high demand for his ability to find anything. He is skeptical of everythinghe suffered brain damage while overseas, which explains his constant paranoia and his being notorious for asking offensive, seemingly irrelevant questions to get to the truth.[36] Production on the episode was scheduled to begin in December 2010, but was delayed to early 2011 due to creative differences.Creator Hart Hanson posted on Twitter (in a humorous manner) regarding the notes he got from the network, "I received studio notes on the Bones spin-off idea. They want it to be better. Unreasonable taskmasters. Impossible dreamers. Neo-platonists."[37] During Fox's TCA press tour, executive producer Stephen Nathan revealed production on the episode featuring The Finder began in February 2011, with the episode airing in April.In the episode, Booth and Brennan travel to Key West, Florida, where the spin-off is said to take place. Nathan went on to say regarding the casting of character, "You want to find people you want to see every single week do one unique character. That's why when you have Hugh Laurie, who is essentially playing a very unlikable character, you love to see him. And that is a rare, rare quality to find. And the finder won't be an unlikeable character, but because it is a unique character, it's difficult to find just the right person."[38] Geoff Stults was cast as the lead character with Michael Clarke Duncan and Saffron Burrows cast as the other two lead characters.[39][40][41] The three characters were introduced in episode 19 of the sixth season.The Finder was picked up for the 20112012 season on May 10, 2011 with an order of 13 episodes.[42]The Finder was canceled on May 9, 2012 and aired its final episode on May 11, 2012.Reviews for the pilot episode were mixed, and holds a Metacritic score of 55 out of 100, based on 29 critical reviews.[43] Subsequent seasons have received generally favorable reviews.[44][45][46]USA Today comments that compared to other crime shows, the show "is built on a more traditional and solid foundation: the strength of its characters" and "what sets Tuesday's Bones premiere apart from the procedural pack are stars Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz, as the season's most appealing new crime fighters."[47] On the other hand, Media Life Magazine says that while Bones has "an amazingly clever notion, brilliant even", its "execution doesn't match the conception" and based on its first episode, the show "fails to evolve into a gripping series. In fact, it quickly becomes so derivative of so much else on televisionespecially, strangely, X-Filesthat one might even call it bone-headed."[48]Bones has received two Emmy nominations, for Outstanding Art Direction for a Single Camera Series for "The Hero in the Hold" at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards and for Outstanding Special Visual Effects in a Supporting Role for "The Twist in the Twister" at the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards.[49]Emily Deschanel was nominated for a 2006 Satellite Award for Best Actress  Television Series Drama.The series has also won two Genesis Awards for the episodes "The Woman in Limbo" and "The Tough Man in the Tender Chicken" for raising awareness on the issues of pig slaughtering and industrial chicken farms, while the episode "The Finger in the Nest" received a nomination.Bones was nominated for two awards at the 37th People's Choice Awards, for Favorite TV Crime Drama and Emily Deschanel for Favorite TV Crime Fighter.[50] The series received three nominations at the 38th People's Choice Awards, for Favorite TV Crime Drama, David Boreanaz for Favorite TV Drama Actor and Emily Deschanel for Favorite TV Drama Actress.[51]Aside from the television broadcast of Bones, its characters and concepts have also been produced in print, on the internet and in short videos for mobile phones.Currently, there are two print books related to the series, one a novel and the other an official guide. Buried Deep (ISBN 978-1-4165-2461-8), written by Max Allan Collins, was published by Pocket Star on February 28, 2006. The book is based on the characters in the television series rather than the characters created by Kathy Reichs, who had inspired the concept of Bones. Its plot focuses on Dr. Temperance Brennan and Special Agent Seeley Booth's investigation into the skeletal remains left on the steps of a federal building and its connection with a Chicago mob family. Bones: The Official Companion (ISBN 978-1-84576-539-2) is written by Paul Ruditis and published by Titan Books, released on October 16, 2007. The book includes cast and crew interviews, episode guides and a background detail on real-life forensics.[52]Fox has made extensive use of the internet to promote Bones. Prior to the broadcast of the second season episode "The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House", profiles of the characters involved in the episode were put up on their own MySpace web page. The blog entries of the characters were created to give insight into the potential suspects to be featured in the episode. In the episode, Brennan and her team uses clues from these web pages, which the viewers can also access.[53]A spin-off series consisting of 26 two-minute episodes, called Bones: Skeleton Crew, was produced by Fox and launched through a partnership with Sprint Nextel in conjunction with MasterCard's sponsorship. It was released to Sprint TV subscribers in November 2006 and released on the official website of Bones on December 4, 2006. The episodes do not feature the show's main cast; its plot revolves around three Jeffersonian Institute lab technicians who use their skills to solve a mystery.[54][55]Bonus content was posted by Fox on Bones' official site during the third season, which include short videos featuring Booth and Brennan waiting to see Dr. Sweets.Bones at TV.com1 Premise2 Cast and characters3 Production

She is an empiricist and author of crime fiction based on her experiences.

Booth is often used to provide a layman's translation of the scientific jargon-filled dialog.

He is a former U.S. Army Ranger and Special Forces sniper.Michaela Conlin as Angela Montenegro: a forensic artist at the Jeffersonian Institute and Dr. Brennan's best friend. Angela is Dr. Brennan's team specialist in craniofacial reconstructionhelping to determine what their victims looked like before death to help determine their identityand can generate holograms using her three-dimensional graphics program (The Angelator and later The Angelatron) to simulate various virtual scenarios of a crime to help determine cause of death. She is open, friendly, and caring and constantly tries to draw Dr. Brennan out of the lab. Angela is the daughter of Billy Gibbons, guitarist of ZZ Top, starring as himself.[4] In season five, she marries Jack Hodgins, and she gives birth to their son in season six.T. J. Thyne as Dr. Jack Hodgins: an entomologist who is also an expert on spores and minerals but whose hobby is conspiracy theories. He helps teach Zack how to be socially normal. His family is extremely wealthy and are major sponsors of the Jeffersonian; Hodgins wishes for this status to remain concealed from his bosses because he does not want to be seen as a superior (it eventually came out during an investigation, although nobody has allowed it to significantly impact their relationships with him).

In the second season, he receives his doctorate in Forensic Anthropology and Mechanical Engineering and becomes a professional forensic anthropologist. Although well-meaning, helpful, and friendly, when a situation calls for social interaction or intuition, he is often lost. During the course of events leading up to the death of serial killer Howard Epps, Zack was almost killed when he unwittingly triggered a pressure sensor tied to a bomb affixed to the headless body of Caroline Epps, only to be saved by Booth. He is extremely intelligent; in episode 11 it is said that his IQ is significantly above 163 (which is already a genius level). He is also Hodgins' best friend and lives in the upper part of Hodgins' garage. Zack was removed from his position on Dr. Brennan's team in the third season finale, "The Pain in the Heart", where he was revealed to be the serial killer's apprentice, and is currently residing in an asylum.

The show, a spin-off from JAG, premiered on September 23, 2003 on CBS and, to date, has aired nine full seasons and has gone into syndicated reruns on USA Network, Cloo (formerly Sleuth), and Ion Television. Donald Bellisario is co-creator, along with Don McGill, as well as executive producer.NCIS was originally referred to as Navy NCIS during season one; "Navy" was later dropped from the title as it was redundant. In season seven, NCIS was joined by a spin-off series, NCIS: Los Angeles, starring Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J.In 2011, NCIS was voted Americas favorite television show.[1] On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed NCIS for a 10th season[2] which premiered on September 25, 2012.[3] Brian Dietzen was also promoted to series regular for season ten.[4]NCIS follows a fictional team of Naval Criminal Investigative Service Major Case Response Team (MCRT)[5] special agents headquartered at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. It is described by the actors and producers (on special features on DVD releases in the United States) as being distinguished by its comedic elements, ensemble acting, and character-driven plots.NCIS is the primary law enforcement and counter-intelligence arm of the United States Department of the Navy, which includes the United States Marine Corps. NCIS investigates all major criminal offenses (felonies)i.e., crimes punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice by confinement of more than one yearwithin the Department of the Navy. The MCRT is frequently assigned to high-profile cases such as the death of the U.S. president's military aide, a bomb situation on a U.S. Navy warship, the death of a celebrity on a reality show set on a US Marine Corps base, terrorist threats involving U.S Naval and Marine weapons and/or Naval or Marine installations, and kidnappings of Navy and Marine Corps personnel.The MCRT is led by Supervisory Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon). Gibbss team is composed of Special Agent and Senior Field Agent Anthony "Tony" DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly), Special Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), and Special Agent (former Mossad liaison officer) Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), who replaced Caitlin "Kate" Todd (Sasha Alexander) when she was shot and killed by rogue Mossad agent Ari Haswari (Rudolf Martin) at the end of season two. The team is assisted in their investigations by Chief Medical Examiner Donald "Ducky" Mallard (David McCallum), his assistant Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen), who replaced Gerald Jackson (Pancho Demmings), and Forensic Specialist Abigail "Abby" Sciuto (Pauley Perrette).It is revealed, through flashbacks, that the head of the MCRT before Gibbs was Special Agent Mike Franks (Muse Watson), who led the unit when it was part of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS), the predecessor agency of the NCIS. Franks recruited Gibbs shortly after Gibbs' retirement from the Marine Corps, eventually retiring himself some years later. After Franks' departure, Gibbs recruited DiNozzo from the Baltimore Police Department's Homicide Section. The two were briefly joined by Vivian Blackadder (Robyn Lively), whom Gibbs recruited from the FBI. In the second part of the NCIS pilot, Blackadder allowed her emotions to nearly derail an anti-terror operation in Spain. Gibbs is noticeably disappointed; Blackadder is not present in the series' first regular episode, replaced by Caitlin Todd, a Secret Service agent who joins Gibbs' team after resigning from the Secret Service. Todd is eventually killed in the line of duty in the season two finale, and is ultimately replaced by Ziva David, who from season three to season seven is the Mossad liaison officer who eventually gains American citizenship and becomes a full agent. McGee first appears as a Field Agent assigned to the Norfolk Field Office. He uses his computer skills to aid the MCRT in subsequent investigations through the rest of season one, until he is officially promoted with his own desk at the Navy Yard in the beginning of season two.NCIS is currently led by Director Leon Vance (Rocky Carroll). The first director seen in the series, Thomas Morrow (Alan Dale), left after being promoted to Deputy Director of the Department of Homeland Security. Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) was appointed director after Morrow in the first episode of season three, the first NCIS director to be in the regular series cast list. After Shepard was killed in a shootout at the end of season five, Vancewho was assistant director of NCIS before her deathwas seen as acting director after her death and was promoted to take her place.Prior to the launch of the first season, advertisements on CBS identified the show as "Naval CIS". By the time of the launch of the first episode, NCIS was airing under the name Navy NCIS, the name it held for the entire first season. Since the "N" in NCIS stands for "Naval", the name "Navy NCIS" was technically redundant. The decision to use this name was reportedly made by CBS, over the objections of Bellisario, in order to:After its successful first season, the name of the series was shortened to NCIS.NCIS is set in the Washington, D.C. area but is filmed in Santa Clarita, California.[15] The sound stages are in Santa Clarita.

DiNozzo is a movie expert and sometimes his expert knowledge can irritate his coworkers.Ziva David (Cote de Pablo) is a Special Agent on the Major Case Response Team since season seven. For her first four years in the show, she was a part of the NCIS team as a Mossad Liaison Officer. David replaced Special Agent Kate Todd, who was killed by David's half-brother, Ari.

On September 28, 2011, after two episodes aired, Fox ordered an additional 11 episodes to the initial 13-episode order, bringing the first season to 24 episodes.[3]New Girl has received favorable responses from critics since its conception, with many giving particular praise for Deschanel's performance. On December 15, 2011, the show was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series Musical or Comedy and Deschanel was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress Television Series Musical or Comedy. The series received five 2012 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series" for Deschanel, "Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series" for Greenfield, "Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series", "Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series" and "Outstanding Main Title Design".New Girl was officially renewed for a second season by Fox on April 9, 2012.[4] It premiered on September 25, 2012.[5] Fox ordered two new episodes of New Girl bringing the second season to 24 episodes.[6]The series begins with Jessica "Jess" Day (played by Zooey Deschanel), an adorable, bubbly woman in her late twenties who teaches at a local Los Angeles elementary school. Jess begins looking for a new place to live after the breakup with her boyfriend. Seeing an ad for a new roommate on Craigslist, she moves in with three young men: Nick, Schmidt, and Coach. Very shortly after her move, Coach moves out, and is replaced by Winston, another young man who had previously lived in the apartment with Nick and Schmidt.The character of Coach, played by Damon Wayans, Jr., appeared in the pilot only. Coach, Nick, Schmidt and Winston were the original four roommates in the apartment, but Winston moved out prior to the first episode, creating an opening for Jess to move in. By the second episode Coach had left, and Winston returned to the apartment. The apartment now consists of Schmidt, Winston, Nick, and Jess.The series was created, produced, and written by Elizabeth Meriwether for Chermin Entertainment and Fox Television Studios.[8][9]In development, the show was provisionally titled Chicks and Dicks, which was temporarily used as the title owing to its description of the storyline at that point. As the script developed, the plot became more socially oriented, rather than being about the sexual endeavors of the roommates, so the title was changed to New Girl.[10]The series premiered on Tuesday September 20 on Fox, and also airs on Channel 4 in the UK, Citytv in Canada and on FOUR in New Zealand. [11] [12]Zooey Deschanel was once asked if the character was written for her specifically, to which she replied that it was not, but "should have been".[13] When asked to join the team, Deschanel was questioned if she had any hesitation. Deschanel replied that she loves working with the team and that Jess is definitely the character she would like to play forever.[14]Damon Wayans, Jr. took the role of "Coach" expecting his previous show, the ABC sitcom Happy Endings, to be cancelled. When that show was renewed for a second season, Wayans left New Girl and was replaced by Morris. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Meriwether says that about 80 percent of the pilot would have needed to be re-shot in order to remove Wayans from the episode, since he was in one of the leading roles of the show. Therefore, Meriwether, 20th Century Fox and the studio decided to keep the characters and the plot of the episode as they were, with Morris joining the show in the second episode of the series.[15][16][17]In June 2011, New Girl was one of eight honorees in the "most exciting new series" category at the 1st Critics' Choice Television Awards, voted by journalists who had seen the pilots.[18] Review aggregate website Metacritic gave it a score of 66/100 based on "generally favorable reviews".[19] BuddyTV ranked New Girl #5 on its list of 2011's best new TV shows.[20]The pilot episode drew 10.28 million viewers, a 4.8 adults 1849 demo rating.[21] This was the highest-rated fall debut for a Fox scripted show since The Bernie Mac Show in 2001.[22]The show has been nominated for several awards, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Comedy Series and for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Zooey Deschanel, as well as a two Critics Choice Awards, Best Comedy Series and Best Comedy Actress for Deschanel. Zooey Deschanel won the award for Best Comedy Actress.[23] The show also received 5 nominations at the 2012 Darwin Awards. This included Best Comedy Series, Best New TV Series, Best Actor (Jake Johnson), Best Actor/Actress in a New TV Series (Zooey Deschanel) and Best Screenplay, winning the latter two.The pilot was first released on such online services as Hulu Plus,[24] TiVo, and iTunes before the September 20 premiere on FoxSeptember 1, 2012New Girl at TV.comZooey DeschanelJake JohnsonMax GreenfieldLamorne MorrisHannah SimoneMichael AndrewsZooey DeschanelElizabeth MeriwetherDave FinkelBrett BaerElizabeth MeriwetherJake KasdanPeter CherninKatherine PopeDave FinkelBrett BaerElizabeth Meriwether PicturesAmerican NitwitsChernin Entertainment20th Century Fox Television480i (SDTV)720p (HDTV)1080i (Channel 4 HD)1 Plot2 Cast and characters

The series has aired eight seasons, and focuses on the fictional lives of surgical interns and residents, as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, while trying to maintain personal lives. The show's premise originated with Shonda Rhimes, who serves as an executive producer, along with Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, Mark Wilding, and Allan Heinberg. The series was created to be racially diverse, utilizing a color-blind casting technique. It is primarily filmed in Los Angeles, California.The series' protagonist is Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), who originally is accepted into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. Meredith is assigned to work under Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), along with Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Dr. George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), and Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers). Following O'Malley's death and Stevens' departure, they are replaced by Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew), in the sixth season. The surgical wing is primarily supervised by Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), who is eventually replaced by Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), and later Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd).Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) departs at the conclusion of the third season, and is replaced by Dr. Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who leaves the show during the fifth season, and later Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), who departs at the end of the eighth season. Introduced in the second season is Dr. Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), who leaves the show at the end of the third season, in order to launch her own spin-off medical drama Private Practice. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) also enter the show in the second season, while the latter dies in the premiere of the ninth season. Meredith's half-sister, Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), appears from season three and dies at the end of season eight. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) is given series regular status at the beginning of the sixth season.Grey's Anatomy is the highest-rated drama in the key 1849 demographic. Previously among the overall top-ten rated shows in the United States, Grey's Anatomy has been well received by critics. Considered an impact on culture, the series has received numerous awards, and has also been included in various critics' top ten lists. The show has produced several specials, as well as distributed all seasons to DVD, and released a collection of merchandise. In 2011, Grey's Anatomy was named the fourth-highest revenue earning show, in terms of advertising per half-hour. On May 11, 2012, the series was renewed for a ninth season, which premiered on September 27.Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, wanted to make a show that she would enjoy watching,[1] and thought it would be interesting to create a show about "smart women competing against one another".[2] When asked how she decided to develop a medical drama, Rhimes responded:The series was pitched to the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), who gave the green light, and the show was picked up as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal in the 2005 television season.[4] Francie Calfo, executive vice president of development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out that [m]edical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [Rhimes] found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it."[2]"ER is high-speed medicine. The camera flies around, adrenaline is rushing. My show is more personal. The idea for the series began when a doctor told me it was incredibly hard to shave her legs in the hospital shower. At first that seemed like a silly detail. But then I thought about the fact that it was the only time and place this woman might have to shave her legs. That's how hard the work is."Rhimes initially conceived Grey's Anatomy as a statement against racism. She endeavored to create a show that featured a racially diverse cast that allowed viewers to relate to characters regardless of race.[5] While creating characters, as well as writing the first script, the series' writers had no character descriptions in mind, and hoped to cast the best actor available for each part. Rhimes has explained that if the network did not allow her to create characters this way, she would have been hesitant about moving forward with the series.[3] Female roles in particular were developed as multi-faceted characters. Rhimes offered her insight on this: "I wanted to create a world in which you felt as if you were watching very real women. Most of the women I saw on TV didn't seem like people I actually knew. They felt like ideas of what women are. They never got to be nasty or competitive or hungry or angry. They were often just the loving wife or the nice friend. But who gets to be the bitch? Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?"[3]The series debuted on March 25, 2005 and was scheduled to run in the Boston Legal time slot for four weeks. However, high ratings and viewership led to it holding onto the slot for the remainder of the season.[2] ABC Entertainment President, Steve McPherson, commented on the scheduling change: "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let [Grey's Anatomy] build on its tremendous momentum through May."[6] The show's title, Grey's Anatomy, was devised as a play on words: a reference to both Henry Gray's medical textbook, Gray's Anatomy, and the title character Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo).[7] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass.[8]Grey's Anatomy is produced by ShondaLand, in association with The Mark Gordon Company, and ABC Studios (formerly Touchstone Television).[9] Rhimes, Betsy Beers, Krista Vernoff, Mark Gordon, Rob Corn, and Mark Wilding have all served as executive producers throughout the course of the series.[10] In subsequent seasons, Steve Mulholland, Kent Hodder, Nancy Bordson, James D. Parriott, and Peter Horton have also been executive producers, with Allan Heinberg joining the show in 2006 in this role.[10] As of season eight, the current executive producers are Rhimes, Beers, Gordon, Vernoff, Corn, Wilding, and Heinberg.[11]Rhimes is the series' most prolific writer. She often promotes the show by answering fan questions on her Twitter account.[12] Other members of the writing staff are Vernoff, Wilding, Peter Nowalk, Stacy McKee, William Harper, Zoanne Clack, Tony Phelan, Joan Rater, and Debora Cahn.[10] From the second through seventh seasons, the writers maintained a blog entitled Grey Matter, where the writer of an episode discussed the motives behind the writing.[13] Directors vary by episode, with Rob Corn directing most frequently, followed by Tom Verica. Horton, Edward Ornelas, and Jessica Yu have also directed a substantial number of episodes.[10] Cast members Chandra Wilson and Kevin McKidd have both directed multiple episodes.[14]Grey's Anatomy has been edited by Susan Vaill since the show's inception,[15] and David Greenspan was named an editor in 2006.[16] Casting directors Linda Lowy and John Brace have been a part of the production team since 2005. Production design is led by Donald Lee Harris, and costume design is led by Mimi Melgaard. Working alongside Melgaard, Thomas Houchins supervises costumes, Ellen Vieira is the makeup artist, and Jerilynn Stevens serves as a hair stylist. The director of photography is Matt Mania, and the music coordinator is Danny Lux.[15] Herbert Davis is the show's cinematographer.[17] Karen Lisa Pike, M.D. is the on-set medical consultant.[18] The production staff is part of a Grey's Anatomy softball team that competes against other television shows, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.[19]"She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say."Grey's Anatomy uses a color-blind casting technique, resulting in a racially diverse ensemble. Each role is cast without the character's races being pre-determined, in keeping with Rhimes' vision of diversity.[21] The production staff began casting with the program's titular character, Meredith Grey,[3] which Rhimes stated was a difficult role to cast.[22] "I kept saying we need a girl like that girl from Moonlight Mile[a]," said Rhimes, "and after a while, they were like, 'We think we can get that girl from Moonlight Mile'."[22] The next to be cast, Sandra Oh (Dr. Cristina Yang), was initially invited to audition for the character of Bailey, but pressed to read for the role of Cristina instead.[23] Many actors read for the role of Dr. Derek Shepherd, but when Patrick Dempsey read for the part, "he was just perfect", according to Rhimes.[22]The only character developed with a racial description in mind was Dr. Miranda Bailey, who is portrayed by Chandra Wilson. The character was written as a tiny blonde with curly hair, but when Wilson began speaking, Rhimes reported: "[Wilson] is exactly who Miranda is."[3] James Pickens Jr. was selected to appear as Dr. Richard Webber in the series' pilot and first season.[24] Katherine Heigl wanted to portray Dr. Izzie Stevens as a brunette, but was requested to retain her natural blonde for the part.[25] Isaiah Washington, who portrayed Dr. Preston Burke, initially read for the role of Shepherd, but was cast as Burke, because the original actor to play Burke had to withdraw.[21] T. R. Knight signed on for the pilot as Dr. George O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, because he liked that the character was multi-faceted.[26] Rounding out the season one cast was Justin Chambers as Dr. Alex Karev.[27]The second season saw the introduction of Eric Dane (Dr. Mark Sloan) and Sara Ramirez (Dr. Callie Torres); initially cast as recurring characters, both were given star billing at the opening of the third season.[28][29] Ramirez was cast after ABC executives offered her a role in the network show of her choice,;[30] Dane had previously auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in the pilot episode.[29] Kate Walsh (Dr. Addison Montgomery) also joined the show in season two, after making a guest appearance in season one.[31] In October 2006, Washington allegedly insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an on-set altercation with Dempsey, and ABC terminated Washington's contract at the end of the third season.[32] At the conclusion of the third season, Walsh also departed the show to pursue the Grey's Anatomy spin-off, Private Practice, but continues to make guest appearances.[33]Chyler Leigh joined the cast as a main character in the fourth season as (Dr. Lexie Grey); Lexie had initially appeared as a guest star in the final two episodes of the third season.[34] On the selection of Leigh for the role of Lexie, Rhimes said: "Chyler stood out...It felt like she could be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting."[35] Brooke Smith (Dr. Erica Hahn), who first appeared on Grey's Anatomy in the second season, became a series regular in the fourth.[36] Shortly after the announcement that Smith would be a regular member of the cast, Entertainment Weekly's Michael Ausiello, reported that her character, Hahn, would depart from Grey's Anatomy on November 6, 2008.[37] E! Online's Kristin Dos Santos asserted that Smith's dismissal from the show had been forced by the ABC network, as part of an attempt to "de-gay" Grey's Anatomy,[38] but Rhimes countered these claims, saying that "we did not find that the magic and chemistry with Brooke's character would sustain in the long run".[37]Season five introduced actor Kevin McKidd (Dr. Owen Hunt), who was signed as a series regular after originally being cast for a specific story arc.[39] In addition, Jessica Capshaw (Dr. Arizona Robbins) appeared in just three episodes of the fifth season, but became a series regular in the sixth.[40] Knight departed the show at the conclusion of season five, citing an unhappiness with the development and lack of screen time for his character.[41] Directly following Knight's departure, it was reported by Entertainment Weekly that Heigl had not returned to the set as scheduled after her maternity leave,[42] and it was later confirmed that Heigl would not return to the show at all.[43]Kim Raver, who was cast as recurring character Dr. Teddy Altman in the sixth season, was given star billing later in the season.[44] Sarah Drew (Dr. April Kepner) and Jesse Williams (Dr. Jackson Avery), who both made their series debuts as recurring characters in the sixth season, received star billing in the seventh.[45][46]The six original actors' contracts expired after season eight, but in May 2012, Pompeo, Oh, Dempsey, Chambers, Wilson, and Pickens renewed their contracts with the show for another two years.[47] At the conclusion of the eighth season, Leigh's character departed from the show at Leigh's request, and with Rhimes' agreement.[48][49] Raver's character was also written out of the show during the season eight finale, and Rhimes stated that Raver was offered a contract renewal, but declined.[50] In July 2012, Dane confirmed that he was departing the show to pursue other projects; he made his final appearances in the first two episodes of the ninth season.[51]Rhimes considered setting the medical drama in her hometown, Chicago, but eventually decided to go with Seattle, to distinguish Grey's Anatomy from the Chicagobased ER.[22]Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building of Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated KOMO radio and television stations in Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. In particular, air ambulances land on the KOMO-TV newscopter's helipad. This suggests the hospital is close to the Space Needle (which is directly across the street from Fisher Plaza), the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and a few interior shots is not in Seattle; these scenes are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills, California.[52] Most scenes are taped at Prospect Studios in Los Feliz, just east of Hollywood, where the Grey's Anatomy set occupies two sound stages. Some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle. Several props used are working medical equipment, including the MRI machine.[53] When asked about operating room scenes, Sarah Drew offered this:Costumes are used to differentiate between attending surgeons, who wear navy blue scrubs, and residents, who wear light blue scrubs.[55] The series is filmed with a single-camera setup, as are many dramas.[56] Grey's Anatomy is often filmed using the "walk and talk" filming technique,[57] popularized on television by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, and The West Wing.[58]Grey's Anatomy follows the lives of surgical interns and residents at the fictional Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, with the help of their competent mentors. Every installment, typically, commences with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey, foreshadowing the theme of the episode.[59] Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field.[60] The season will always end with a finale, typically involving a tragic event such as a death or character departure.[61] Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show puts an emphasis on their personal, rather than professional, lives.[59] The series sets aside medical ethics concerns to focus on character development and relationships. Although the physicians treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, their primary motivation is customarily praise and competition.[62]The residents initially arrive at the hospital each morning and dispute with one another over who will care for a certain patient.[63] A hospital superior is in charge of assigning cases, often traversing to tense feelings between the residents and superiors.[64] Episodes migrate back and forth from the doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of their attending physician, which usually leads to surgery.[65] The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to their doctor, which unintentionally relates to their private life.[66] The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal lives and their professional. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series.[67] At the conclusion of each episode, Meredith delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on her initial one.[59]The five characters who are first introduced in the series premiere, as surgical interns, are Meredith, the hardcore Karev, the insecure O'Malley, the cheerful Stevens, and the "no-nonsense" Yang.[68] They are initially mentored by Bailey, a senior resident who becomes the hospital's Chief Resident,[69] and later an attending general surgeon, in season six.[70] The surgical program is initially headed by the Chief of Surgery, Webber, who has a pre-existing personal relationship with Meredith, having had an affair with her mother when she was a child. In Webber's employ are attendings Shepherd, dubbed 'McDreamy' by the residents, from New York and Burke, who specialize in neurosurgery and cardiothoracic surgery, respectively. Shepherd is introduced as Meredith's love interest, while Burke begins a relationship with Yang.[71]Introduced in the show's second season are obstetrician-gynecologist and neonatal surgeon, Montgomery,[72] plastic surgeon Sloan, from New York,[73] and orthopedic surgeon Torres.[74] Montgomery is Shepherd's wife who arrives in Seattle seeking reconciliation with him,[75] Sloan is Shepherd's former best friend, who aided the breakdown of his marriage by having an affair with Montgomery,[76] while Torres is introduced as a love-interest, and eventual wife for O'Malley. The penultimate episode of season three introduces Lexie, Meredith's half-sister who unexpectedly decides to pursue her internship at Seattle Grace Hospital after her mother's sudden death, and begins an on-again, off-again relationship with Sloan.[77] Burke and Yang, having been engaged,[78] endeavor to plan their wedding, while Montgomery departs the show at the conclusion of the third season, relocating to California, seeking a new life. The season three finale sees Burke's exit from the show, after leaving Yang at the altar on their wedding day.[79]Meredith, Yang, Karev, and Stevens are all promoted to residents, in the season four premiere,[80] while O'Malley is forced to repeat his internship year, following his failing of the intern exam.[79] Subsequently, Torres and O'Malley divorce one another, due to him having a sexual affair with Stevens, initially concealing it from Torres.[81][82] Early in the fourth season, cardiothoracic surgeon Hahn becomes Torres' love interest.[83] During the fifth season, Hahn departs from the series,[84] and O'Malley retakes his intern exam, passing, joining his fellow physicians as a resident.[85] Two new characters are introduced: former United States Army trauma surgeon Hunt,[86] and pediatric surgeon Robbins.[87] Hunt becomes a love-interest for Yang,[88] while Robbins becomes a love-interest for Torres.[89] When Stevens is diagnosed with stage four metastatic melanoma,[90] she and Karev wed one another at the conclusion of the fifth season.[91] In addition, Meredith and Shepherd marry, with their vows written on a post-it note.[92]O'Malley dies in the premiere of the sixth season, due to injuries sustained while being dragged by a bus,[70] and Stevens later departs following the breakdown of her relationship with Karev.[66] Several new characters are introduced as Seattle Grace Hospital merges with Mercy West.[93] Residents Kepner and Avery both transfer to Seattle Grace Hospital from Mercy West, and the latter entertains a brief relationship with Lexie, until she reunites with Sloan.[94] Subsequently, Altman is introduced as the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery.[95] In the season six finale, a deceased patient's grieving husband embarks on a shooting spree at the hospital, injuring Karev, Shepherd, and Hunt.[96][97] In the shooting's emotional reverberations, Hunt and Yang abruptly marry, not wanting to risk separation.[98] Torres and Robbins eventually wed, officiated by Bailey.[99] Season eight sees Webber stepping down, with his job being allocated to Hunt.[100] As the final year of residency for Meredith, Yang, Karev, Avery, and Kepner is coming to a close, the doctors are all planning to relocate to different hospitals to pursue their specialty careers.[101] However, all plans are put on hold when several doctors from Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital are engaged in an aviation accident, which kills Lexie and endangers Meredith, Shepherd, Yang, Robbins, and Sloan.[61] At the conclusion of the eighth season, Altman is fired by Hunt, and decides to pursue a career at the United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM).[61] In the season nine premiere, Sloan dies due to sustained injuries from the plane crash.[102]With the drama's setting being a hospital, numerous medical personnel appear regularly on the show, as well as several other recurring characters. Joe (Steven W. Bailey), is first shown as the owner of the Emerald City Bar and Grill, across the street from the hospital, which is a common relaxation area for the physicians.[72] Also introduced in the pilot, is the legendary former surgeon, Dr. Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), Meredith's Alzheimer's-stricken mother, who appeared on the show until her death in season three.[68] In the first season, Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), a nurse who appeared on the show occasionally until getting laid off in the merger with Mercy West,[93] engages in sexual activity with O'Malley, giving him Syphilis.[72] Serving as an assistant and secretary to the Chief of Surgery, former nurse Patricia (Robin Pearson Rose), has appeared on the show since its debut.[68] Tyler Christian (Moe Irvin), a hospital nurse, makes occasional appearances throughout the series.[68] Within the second season, Bailey becomes impregnated with her husband, Tucker Jones (Cress Williams)' baby,[103] who makes frequent appearances on Grey's Anatomy, until their divorce in season five.[92] While Bailey takes a sabbatical, due to her pregnancy, the cheerful Dr. Sydney Heron (Kali Rocha), fills her position as the resident supervising Meredith, Yang, Karev, O'Malley, and Stevens,[104] and makes occasional appearances until the fifth season.[82]Thatcher and Susan Grey (Jeff Perry and Mare Winningham), Meredith's estranged father and step-mother, are introduced in season two,[105] with Susan making appearances until her death in season three,[106] and Thatcher continuing to appear on the series.[107] Adele Webber (Loretta Devine), is introduced as Richard's wife,[108] who eventually acquires Alzheimer's, in the seventh season,[109] and continues to make appearances.[110] Introduced as Preston's mother, Jane Burke (Diahann Carroll) makes occasional appearances until the fourth season. Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a patient suffering from congestive heart failure, originates as one of Burke's patients,[111] who goes on to propose to Stevens, after weeks of bonding between the two.[112] Facing death, Stevens cuts Duquette's left ventricular assist device (LVAD), to elevate his position on the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) transplant list.[113] This ultimately ends in his death, marking his initial departure from the show,[108] and placing Stevens on disciplinary probation.[114] Initially conceived as a veterinarian hired for Shepherd's dog, Doc,[105] Dr. Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell) soon becomes a love interest for Meredith, while Shepherd is with Montgomery.[115] Dandridge is included in a multi-episode story arc, consisting of nine episodes, ending when Meredith reunites with Shepherd.[116]In season three, George's father, Harold O'Malley (George Dzundza), is diagnosed with cancer and dies, with his wife Louise (Debra Monk) and George's brothers Jerry (Greg Pitts) and Ronny (Tim Griffin) by his side.[117] Louise goes on to appear occasionally, and was last seen in season eight.[118] A ferryboat accident brings along Rebecca Pope (Elizabeth Reaser), who is initially introduced as a pregnant Jane Doe victim, suffering from Amnesia.[119] Pope eventually embarks on a relationship with Karev, until she is diagnosed with a personality disorder in season four, and makes her final departure.[83] Amidst the crisis of the ferryboat crash, Meredith falls into the water at the disaster site.[119] Although rescued, she goes into cardiac arrest, waking up in what appears to be limbo.[120] Within the limbo, Meredith is entertained by deceased acquaintances Duquette and Dylan Young (Kyle Chandler), who was killed during a bomb crisis in the second season,[121] until eventually being resuscitated.[122] Seeking a cure to her depression, Meredith undergoes therapy sessions with the hospital psychiatrist, Dr. Katharine Wyatt (Amy Madigan),[123] who in addition, serves as a psychiatrist to Hunt.[124]The season four premiere introduces several new interns, to be trained under Meredith, Yang, Karev, Stevens, and eventually O'Malley.[b] Among them are Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul) who continues to make appearances,[80] and Dr. Sadie Harris (Melissa George) who formed a friendship with Meredith while the two were in college.[125] Harris is fired in the fifth season, due to not actually having a medical degree, and departs the show immediately after.[89] Meredith and Shepherd's relationship reaches a toll, and the two separate, leading Shepherd to entertaining a relationship with Rose (Lauren Stamile), a nurse.[82] Rose appears frequently until season five, when Shepherd rekindles his relationship with Meredith.[86] Throughout the fifth season, Stevens experiences full-out hallucinations of Duquette,[87] signaling that she is ill,[126] and once she is lucid, he departs, marking his final appearance.[124] Following the announcement of her relationship with Robbins, Callie's father Carlos Torres (Hector Elizondo) initially contests his daughter's concurrence in homosexuality,[127] but eventually accepts it,[94] and he reappears several times throughout the series.[99]The hospital's merging with Mercy West introduces new residents: Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner) and Dr. Charles Percy (Robert Baker),[94] but the two are both murdered in the season six finale.[96][97] Also introduced in the sixth season is Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George), an anesthesiologist[128] and eventual fiance to Bailey,[61] as well as Sloan Riley (Leven Rambin), Sloan's estranged daughter who seeks kinship with him.[95] Dr. Lucy Fields (Rachael Taylor), an obstetrician-gynecologist, is introduced in the seventh season, and serves as a love interest for Karev,[129] until eventually relocating to pursue a career in Africa.[9] Robbins receives a grant to aid children in Malawi, which leads to a falling out between her and Torres.[130] While in Malawi, Robbins is replaced by Dr. Robert Stark (Peter MacNicol),[131] a pediatric surgeon with an interest in Kepner,[132] who appears occasionally until season eight.

The series holds a score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on five reviews for season seven.[138] The first season received mixed to positive reviews, with Gary Levin of USA Today calling Grey's Anatomy one of the top shows on television.[139] The Washington Post's Tom Shales was critical of season one, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: "The show is much more a matter of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different."[140] Shortly after its initial airing, the Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan called Grey's Anatomy the new Friends; a concluded National Broadcasting Company (NBC) sitcom following the lives of a group of young adults, that spent most of its ten-year run in the top-five for viewer ratings.[1] Regarding the second season, Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures opined that Grey's Anatomy is a mere combination of Scrubs, ER, Sex and the City, and The Love Boat.[141] On a more positive note, Christopher Monfette of IGN added: "The second season of this medical drama expertly wove its signature elements of complex relationships, whimsical banter and challenging life-lessons; all to a montage-fetish, indie-rock soundtrack."[142]Regarding season three, Monfette of IGN said that it speedily found itself "mired in the annoying and absurd", adding: "This third season may very well represent a case of over-writing a concept that has, perhaps tragically, run bone-dry on narrative fuel."[142] Contrasting with Monfette's view of the season, Bill Carter of The New York Times called Grey's Anatomy "television's hottest show", adding: "[No show] is expected to challenge Grey's Anatomy for prime-time pre-eminence."[143] At the conclusion of season three, Entertainment Weekly's Gregory Kirschling said "the show lacked a defining happy, warm-gooseflesh moment", adding that the season "didn't leave you dying for the [next] season premiere".[144] Speaking of the fourth season, Laura Burrows of IGN said the series became "a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic", adding: "This season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot."[145]The titular character of Grey's Anatomy, Meredith, has received moderately positive feedback by critics, with Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times referring to her as "the heroine of Grey's Anatomy".[146] When Pompeo did not receive an Emmy nomination for her work as Meredith, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times suggested that Pompeo, "who has worked very hard and against all narrative odds to make Meredith Grey an interesting character", should have received a nomination at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, in 2009.[147] IGN's Monfette, less impressed, criticized her storyline as "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do."[142] Robert Rorke of the New York Post was also critical of Meredith's role in the show, writing: "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless 'McDreamy' soliloquies."[148]The majority of the supporting cast of Grey's Anatomy have been well received as well, with the New York Post's Rorke deeming Stevens to be "the heart and soul" of Grey's Anatomy, whereas Eyder Peralta of the Houston Chronicle was critical of her character development, stating: "[She's] the reason I don't watch Grey's Anatomy anymore."[149] With the departure of several cast members throughout the seasons, many new characters were added to the drama's ensemble. McKidd and Capshaw were referred to as "fresh additions" to the series, by Monfette of IGN.[150] In addition, Matt Roush of TV Guide commented: "Hunt/McKidd is the most encouraging thing to happen to Grey's Anatomy in quite a while."[151] Speaking of the new cast members, in addition to the remaining original, Robert Bianco from USA Today called them the show's "best ensemble in years".[152]In contrast to the moderately negative feedback the third and fourth seasons received, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said of the fifth season: "Overall, it feels more like the good old days than Grey's Anatomy has in a long time." Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears."[153] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines.[154] Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: "Grey's has always loved grand gestures. You like them or you don't; the only real question is whether the show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did."[155]In response to the seventh season, Bianco from USA Today commented: "Happily, it now seems to have landed on solid ground." Also of the seventh season, Entertainment Weekly's Jennifer Armstrong said: "It's in the shooting's emotional reverberations that the show is regenerating after the past few hit-and-miss seasons," whereas Verne Gay of Newsday commented: "Unfortunately, they've settled on far-too-easy and facile answers for the most part."[156] Speaking of season eight, Entertainment Weekly's Mandi Bierly called it a "so-so season",[157] and Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it "emotional".[158]Critics included Grey's Anatomy in top ten lists for four of its first six seasons; these are listed below in order of rank."Grey's Anatomy makes an impact on how people's perception of the world is created."Grey's Anatomy has been considered an impact on culture by Entertainment Weekly's executive editor, Lori Majewski, with her writing: "Grey's Anatomy isn't just a show, it's a phenomenon. When [the] final shows air, every place in New York City is empty. You could get a table at the best restaurants."[164] The Daily Beast's Jace Lacob also considered the show an impact, comparing its success to that of Friends, and calling it a "cultural phenomenon".[165] Steve Sternberg, a media analyst with Magna Global USA explained that the show appeals to a broad audience, writing: "Roughly 80 percent of households during prime time only have one TV set on. People are looking for shows they can watch with other household members."[2] Grey's Anatomy introduced a "mc-labeling" surge, ever since it dubbed Dempsey's character "McDreamy". Canadian newspaper the National Post considers this trend a "phenomenon".[166]Analyzing the show's impact on culture, Dessylyn Arnold of Yahoo! Voices noted that the "mc-labeling" trend has been parodied on other shows including ER and Degrassi: The Next Generation.[167] Mark Lawson of The Guardian has credited Grey's Anatomy with popularizing the "songtage", or musical montage segments.[67] Parodying this, MADtv created a spoof on the show in 2006, making fun of the series' emotional scenes including those accompanied by a musical montage.[168] The show's premise inspired the creation of A Corazn Abierto, a Colombian adaptation of Grey's Anatomy,[169] which in turn spawned a Mexican version of the same name.[170] A study conducted by the University of Western Sydney revealed that 94% of 400 polled medical students are regular viewers of Grey's Anatomy.[171] An additional study conducted by Brian Quick of the University of Illinois indicated that the show's portrayal of doctors being "smart, good looking, capable, and interesting", leads viewers to associating real-world doctors to be that way.[163]In 2011, a woman residing in Sheboygan, Wisconsin became unresponsive due to an asthma attack. Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her, which they learned from Grey's Anatomy.[172] Despite this, Resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: "None of [the characters] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and makeup on. That is so far away from the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, trying to stay alive. You don't have time to do your hair. You don't have time to put on makeup. Every surgical intern has bags under their eyes."[173] The series placed at No. 66 on Entertainment Weekly's "New TV Classics" list,[174] and was declared the third highest rated show for the first ten years of the Internet Movie Database (20022012).[175]Grey's Anatomy has received high viewership and ratings since its debut. The first four seasons of the program each ranked in the top ten among all viewers, reaching its peak Nielsen ratings in the second season, attracting an average of 19.44 million viewers per episode, and ranking at fifth place overall. Following the show's time-slot being relocated, overall rankings steadily declined, dropping below the top ten in its fifth season. Grey's Anatomy made its greatest fall from its sixth to seventh season, slipping from seventeenth place to thirty-first. The series is on a steady decline in terms of overall viewership and rankings, yet Grey's Anatomy still holds value in charts when numbers are pulled from the digital video recorder (DVR). It was the most recorded show between 2007 and 2011, based on cumulative totals, and has been for several years in a row.[176]The most-watched episode of the series is "It's the End of the World", with 37.88 million viewers, aided by a lead-in from Super Bowl XL.[177] In contrast, the least-watched episode is "The Lion Sleeps Tonight", which garnered 8.19 million viewersa 30% decrease from "It's the End of the World".[178] In 2011, Grey's Anatomy was named the fourth-highest revenue earning show of the year, with US$2.67 million per half hour, behind Desperate Housewives, Two and a Half Men, and American Idol.[179] While Grey's Anatomy is no longer ranked in the top numbers for overall ratings, the show's ranking in the key 1849 demographic has remained high. As of season eight, the series is the highest-rated drama on television in the target demographic.[180] Below is a table of Grey's Anatomy's seasonal rankings in the U.S. television market, based on average total viewers per episode.

The cast of Grey's Anatomy was reportedly unhappy about the decision, as all hoped the spin-off would have been given to them. Pompeo commented that she felt, as the star, she should have been consulted,[251] and Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Stevens.[252] The backdoor pilot that aired on May 3, 2007 sees Montgomery take a leave of absence from Seattle Grace Hospital, to visit her best friend from Los Angeles, Naomi Bennett (Audra McDonald), a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist.

All episodes are approximately forty-three minutes, and are broadcast in both high-definition and standard.[259] The series' episodes are also available for download at the iTunes Store in standard and high-definition qualities,[260] and Amazon Instant Video.[261] ABC Video on demand also releases recent episodes of the show for temporary viewing.[262] Recent episodes are also available at ABC's official Grey's Anatomy website,[263] and on Hulu.[264] In 2009, ABC signed a deal allowing Grey's Anatomy episodes to be streamed on Netflix.[265] Grey's Anatomy is syndicated on Lifetime, with one hour blocks weekdays at 1:00 pm, 2:00 pm, and 3:00 pm EST.[266]Since its debut, Buena Vista Home Entertainment has released all seven seasons of Grey's Anatomy onto DVD, to regions 1, 2, and 4, with the eighth set to be released in September 2012, and available for pre-order.[267] The first season's DVD, released on February 14, 2006, features an alternate title sequence, bloopers, behind-the-scenes footage, audio commentaries, and an extended edition of the pilot episode.[268] Season two's DVD, released on September 12, 2006, includes extended episodes, an interview with Wilson, deleted scenes, a set tour, a "Q&A" with the cast, and a segment on the creating of special effects.[269] The DVD for season three was released on September 11, 2007, with bonus features including extended episodes, an interview with Dempsey, audio commentaries, and bloopers.[270]The fourth season's DVD released on September 9, 2008, features an interview with Heigl and Chambers, extended episodes, bloopers, and deleted scenes.[271] Season five's DVD was released on September 15, 2009, and includes unaired scenes, bloopers, and extended episodes.[272] The DVD for season six, released on September 14, 2010, features deleted scenes, an extended finale, and bloopers.[273] The seventh season's DVD, released on September 13, 2011, includes an extended edition of the musical episode, bloopers, as well as deleted scenes.[267] In addition, the eighth season's DVD will be released on September 4, 2012, with bonus features to be announced.[267]ABC has partnered with CafePress and Barco Uniforms to provide branded merchandise through an online store. The products available include shirts, sweatshirts, kitchen-ware, home-ware, and bags, with the Grey's Anatomy logo on it.[e] Also available are custom unisex scrubs and lab coats in a variety of colors and sizes, designed by Barco.[274] The merchandise released by ABC is available for purchase at the Grey's Anatomy official website, and US$1 from every purchase to Barco's Nightingales Foundation.[275]Five volumes of the Grey's Anatomy Original Soundtrack have been released as of 2011. For the first two seasons, the show's main title theme was an excerpt from "Cosy in the Rocket", by British duo Psapp; it is featured on the first soundtrack album released via ABC's corporate cousin, Hollywood Records, on September 27, 2005. The second soundtrack, featuring songs from the series' second season, was released on September 12, 2006,[276] followed by a third soundtrack with music from the third season.[277] Following the seventh season musical episode "Song Beneath the Song", "Grey's Anatomy: The Music Event" soundtrack was released,[278] with volume four of the soundtrack released subsequently.[279]In January 2009, Ubisoft announced that it had signed a licensing agreement with ABC Studios to develop a video game based on Grey's Anatomy.[280] Designed for the Wii, Nintendo DS, and PC, Grey's Anatomy: The Video Game was released on March 10, 2009.[281] The game allows the player to assume the role of one of the main characters, making decisions for the character's personal and professional life, and competing in a number of minigames.[282] It has been criticized by reviewers because of the simplicity of the mini-games and voice actors who do not play the same characters on the series, with Jason Ocampo of IGN giving it a 6.0 out of 10 overall rating.[282] ABC and Nielsen partnered in 2011 to create a Grey's Anatomy application for Apple's iPad. The application was designed to allow viewers to participate in polls and learn trivial facts as they watch a live episode. It uses Nielsen's Media-Sync software to listen for the episode and to post features as the episode progresses.[283]Grey's Anatomy at TV.com1 Production

TVGrey's AnatomyportalTelevisionportalUnited StatesportalWashingtonportalSeattleportalThe Bachelorette is a spin-off from the American competitive reality dating game show The Bachelor. In its January 2003 debut on ABC, the first season featured Trista Rehn, the runner-up date from the first season of The Bachelor, offering the opportunity for Rehn to choose a husband among 25 bachelors. The 2004 season of The Bachelorette again took a runner-up from the previous season of The Bachelor. After last airing on February 28, 2005, the series returned to ABC during the spring of 2008, following an absence of three years.[1]All of the rules are adopted from its parent show, The Bachelor. The series revolves around a single bachelorette (deemed eligible) and a pool of romantic interests (typically 25; 30 in season 5), which could include a potential husband for the bachelorette. The format is the same as the parent show. Unlike The Bachelor, one of two male suitors proposes to the bachelorette for the final selection.Trista Rehn's marriage to Ryan Sutter has been the only marriage to occur in The Bachelorette history in eight seasons, while Ashley Hebert's upcoming marriage will make the second marriage. Unlike The Bachelor, all eight seasons of The Bachelorette have ended with a proposal whether or not the Bachelorette decided to accept or decline.Mike Fleiss, creator of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, as well as former contestants, have come forth confessing that both shows are scripted. The Bachelorette Season 4 winner, Jesse Csincsak, admits that contestants must follow producers' orders and that a storyline is fabricated in the editing room.[2]In an exclusive interview on February 26, 2009 between The Bachelor Season 13 contestant Megan Parris, and Steve Carbone, Megan explains how the producers edit the footage to create a fake storyline. "I don't think [the producers] showed any real conversation I had with anyone... The viewers fail to realize that editing is what makes the show... You'll hear someone make one comment and then they'll show a clip of somebody's face to make it look like that is their facial reaction to that statement, but really, somebody made that face the day before to something else. It's just piecing things together to make a story."[3]Megan Parris confesses that not only is the show scripted, but that producers "bully" contestants into saying specific things to the camera that the contestants do not want to say.[4] "'There's nothing real about it,' she said of the show's trademark "confessionals," in which contestants talk to the camera about the latest goings-on. "It is scripted," she said. "They basically will call you names, berate you, curse at you until they get you to say what they want you to say." Both ABC and Warner Bros., the studio that produces The Bachelor, had no comment."[5]On March 15, 2010 The Bachelorette creator Mike Fleiss appeared on 20/20 to confess that he develops the show's contestants into characters that will cater to his audience's tastes and that they "need [their] fair share of villains every season."[6] Fleiss has come under fire for admitting that The Bachelor has less to do with reality than it does making good television.[7]By Season 7 of The Bachelorette, actors were being hired by ABC to play specific roles on the show.[8] Many fans were becoming tired of the show's scripted nature and speaking out.[9] By Season 8 there were numerous complaints when the entire cast of The Bachelorette overtly acted out the show's written script with the cast of The Muppets.[10]On February 24, 2012, during the filming of The Women Tell All episode of The Bachelor Season 16, what should have been a private conversation between contestant Courtney Robertson and one of the shows producers went public when the microphones were accidentally left on in between camera takes. The leaked conversation revealed the producer's role as an acting coach who was encouraging Robertson to fake certain emotions for the camera which she was not feeling.[11]The Bachelorette at TV.com1 Plot2 Questions of authenticity3 Seasons

SYTYCD was created by American Idol producers Simon Fuller and Nigel Lythgoe and is produced by 19 Entertainment and Dick Clark Productions. The first season was hosted by current American news personality Lauren Snchez. Since the second season, it has been hosted by former British children's television personality and one-time game show emcee Cat Deeley. During its second season, the program remained the No. 1 rated summer show (adults aged 1849) but it has declined in ratings since and, despite an initial ratings rise at the beginning of season 9, the show has since hit an all-time low in viewership (at 4.16 million for season 9's Top 8 show).The show features a tiered format wherein dancers from a variety of styles enter open auditions held in a number of major U.S. cities to showcase their unique styles and talents and, if allowed to move forward, then are put through additional rounds of auditions to test their ability to adapt to different styles. At the end of this process, a small number of dancers are chosen as finalists. These dancers move on to the competition's main phase, where they perform solo, duet, and group dance numbers in a variety of styles. They compete for the votes of the broadcast viewing audience which, combined with the input of a panel of judges, determines which dancers advance to the next stage from week to week. The number of finalists has varied as determined by a season's format, but has typically been 20 contestants.The show features a broad variety of American and international dance styles including classical, contemporary, ballroom, hip-hop, street, club, jazz, and musical theatre styles, amongst others, with many sub-genres within the categories represented. Competitors attempt to master these styleswhich are generally, but not always, assigned by a luck-of-the-draw systemto survive successive weeks of elimination. The eventual champion wins a cash prize (typically $250,000) and the title of "America's Favorite Dancer". In nine seasons, the winners have been Nick Lazzarini, Benjamin Schwimmer, Sabra Johnson, Joshua Allen, Jeanine Mason, Russell Ferguson, Lauren Froderman, Melanie Moore, Eliana Girard and Chehon Wespi-Tschopp, with Girard and Wespi-Tschopp sharing the title as dual-winners for season 9. The show has won seven Emmy Awards for Outstanding Choreography and a total of nine Emmys altogether.Spin-offs were announced starting in August 2005 and to date 23 localized adaptations of So You Think You Can Dance have been produced representing 24 different countries.A typical season of So You Think You Can Dance is divided between a selection process, during which expert judges select competitors from a wide pool of applicant dancers, and a competition phase, during which these 'finalists' (more typically referred to as the 'Top 20') compete for votes from home viewers. Though it is produced over the course of months, the selection phase is highly edited and usually constitutes only the first 24 weeks of aired episodes, with the competition episodes forming the remaining 89 weeks of the season.The open auditions, the first stage in determining a seasons finalists, take place in 56 major U.S. cities each season and are typically open to anyone aged 1830 at the time of their audition. The cities where auditions are held change from season to season but some, such as Los Angeles and New York, have featured in most seasons. During this stage, dancers perform a brief routine (typically a solo, but duet and group routines are allowed as well) before a panel of dance experts, usually headed by series creator and executive producer Nigel Lythgoe. This panel then decides on-the-spot whether the dancer demonstrated enough ability and performance value to proceed further. If the dancer exhibited exceptional ability in their performance, judges award a "ticket to Vegas," moving them instantly one step forward in the competition. Alternatively, if judges are on the fence about the dancer, they will ask the contestant to wait until the end of that day's auditions to participate in a short test of their ability to pick up professional choreography.The second stage of the selection process  referred to as "the callbacks" or "Vegas Week" (after the city of Las Vegas, where it has been held since season 2) is a several-day-long process in which the remaining hopefuls are tested for overall well-rounded dance ability, stamina, and their ability to perform under pressure. The dancers are put through a battery of rounds that test their ability to pick up various dance styles (typically some of the more well-represented genres that are later prominent in the competition phase, such as hip-hop, jazz, ballroom and contemporary). Additionally they may be asked to perform further solos in styles of their choosing and, since season 2, participate in a group choreography round in which small teams of contestants must display their musicality and ability to communicate professionally by choreographing a performance to a randomly selected piece of music  this challenge is notable as being the only time competitors are asked to choreograph themselves, aside from solos. Vegas week is often portrayed as one of the most exhausting and stressful stages of the competition; each successive round sees cuts in which a significant portion of the remaining dancers are eliminated from competition and dancers are given a limited amount of time to adapt to styles they are sometimes wholly unfamiliar with while being physically taxed by the rapid progression of rounds and a limited amount of rest. At the end of this process, usually less than 40 competitors remain in a pool that final contestants are chosen from. Most seasons have featured 20 top finalists for the competition portion of the show, but Season One was represented by a Top 16 and Season Seven saw a Top 11.Following Vegas Week -- which has, through video vignettes, made many of the dancers increasingly familiar to the audience as it observes their attempts to cope with the challenges of the week -- the judge's panel selects their finalists from the remaining dancers, breaking the good or bad news to each dancer. Since Season six, the series has also featured a showcase episode that takes place immediately before the main competition. In this showcase, dancers compete for the first time on the main SYTYCD stage in Los Angeles before a live audience. The dancers dance duet or group routines, but only in their own styles and no dancers are in danger of elimination at this point. In seasons eight and nine, the finalist announcement episode and the dancer's showcase have been combined into one episode, with groups of dancers taking to the stage for the first time immediately after they are revealed.Following the finalist selection process, the show transitions into its regular competition phase, which lasts the rest of the season. The competition stage is divided into 89 weeks, with two contestants eliminated per week (or in the case of season 7, one contestant). Dancers are pairedup -- in some seasons at random, and in others by judges  into male-female couples that will stay paired for half of the remaining competition if neither is eliminated. These couples perform 12 duets per week in randomly-selected styles. These duets, as with all non-solo performances at this stage in the competition, are choreographed by professional choreographers, who are often noteworthy names in their own genres or American dance culture at large. Prior to most duet performances, a video packet of clips of the couple preparing to perform the routine is shown; these packets are intended not only to demonstrate the couple's efforts to master the routine, but also to give glimpses of the personalities of the dancers as well as to allow the choreographer to give insight as to the thematic, narrative, and artistic intentions of the piece. Following each duet performance, the week's panel of judges gives critical feedback, often emphasizing the two key areas of technique and performance value. These duets and their accompanying video packets and critiques typically take up the majority of a competition show but may be supplemented by solos or group numbers during the later portion of the season. Each competition show ends with a quick recap of the night's routines accompanied by on-screen reminders of the telephone numbers by which at-home viewers can vote for the contestant(s) of their choosing and it is at this point that those lines open to receive votes. As of Season 8, voting can also be performed online. Performance shows typically last two hours, commercials included.In seasons 2-8 the show's weekly format was split between two episodes, a performance episode, as described above, and a results show which reveals the outcome of the at-home-viewer voting. Results shows typically aired on the night immediately following that of the performance show of the same week and usually opened with a group routine from the remaining contestants. The main purpose of this show was to determine which of the dancers are eliminated that week, but these episodes generally also featured guest dance performances or guest musical acts, and sometimes video packets that provide insight on the dancers and their journey on the show; Lythgoe has commented that the group routines and occasional guest performances will be included in the singular weekly episodes of season 9. Regardless of how many shows air per week for a given season, a bottom three couples (those that garnered the fewest votes from viewers) are typically revealed weekly at this stage in the competition. Each of these six dancers are then in danger of elimination and must perform a solo for the judges as their last effort to impress and stay in the competition. The judges then retire briefly (typically during the night's headlining musical guest performance) to determine which man and woman (which are not necessarily from the same couple) will leave the competition. The eliminated dancers are then announced and given a brief send-off via a video montage. If the dancers who were eliminated were not from the same couple then the two remaining members form a new couple for the following week's performances. On two occasions, the judges, unwilling to send any of the bottom dancers home on the merits of their performances that week, have abstained from making an elimination and instead allowed all competitors to proceed to the next week, which would be followed by an elimination of the double the usual number of competitors. Results shows have varied in length from one to two hours, commercials included. In season one there was no results show and the dancers' eliminations were pre-recorded the week they occurred and then broadcast at the beginning of the next week's episode. Season nine has marked a return to the one-episode-per-week format but differs in that contestants eliminations will be revealed at the end of an episode, when voting from the previous week is revealed, but only after the dancers have performed the new week's routines and been given another chance to impress the judges.Around the time that the show enters its 'Top Ten' competitor phase, there are typically several format changes that take place. Couples are split up and new pairings are formed for each of the remaining weeks (though some couples may be paired up more than once). Additionally, voting is usually then cast for individual dancers rather than couples (in season nine, dancers will be voted for on an individual basis from the start). Lastly, the judges often give up their power to save dancers at this point, and eliminations are determined exclusively by viewer votes, with judges serving in only an advisory capacity - in seasons 2-6, a results show was still shown the following night to reveal the results of the vote, though it featured a bottom four dancers as opposed to a bottom three couples once the Top 10 stage was reached. Each season undergoes one final format shake-up in its last week, which typically takes place when the show reaches a Top 4 (though season six saw a Top 6 finale and season seven a Top 3). In the final performance show, the remaining dancers typically each dance duets with all of their remaining fellow finalists as well as perform solos and participate in group numbers. The following night's season finale episode is often the most elaborately produced show of a season and features the last performances of the competitors, encore performances of many of the season's most acclaimed routines, guest dancers (including returning past season competitors and cast-members from other international versions of the franchise), musical performances and multiple video packets chronicling the course of the season's events, all culminating in the announcement of the winner of the competition, as decided by the previous night's vote. In the first 8 seasons, a singular winner was announced (of which there have been four women and four men over the course of the series; starting in season 9, two winners will be crowned, one guy and one girl. Following the closure of the season, the Top Ten dancers often go on tour for several months, performing hit routines from the season amongst other performances.While the above describes the most likely format for a given season, there have been notable variations in how various seasons have been arranged. While most seasons have seen 20 top finalists, season 1, being slightly shorter in length than all following seasons, saw only a Top 16, and its final performance show had an improvisational segment that was never again seen on the show. Aired in the fall (as opposed to the summer as with most other seasons), Season Six saw some cuts to its average air time per episode and ended at a Top Six rather than a Top Four. Season Seven featured a number of different format tweaks, several of which have not been featured in any other season; rather than featuring a Top 20 with two eliminations per week, Season seven had a Top 11 and sent home only one dancer per week, ending with a Top 3 finale. Season Seven also saw the introduction of 'All-Stars', former contestants who return in a non-competitive role to pair with new competitors for some of their routines. Season Eight saw a return to the Top 20 format but also continued to use All-Stars after the competition reached the Top Ten phase and this format will be applied to season 9 as well.[1]The judging panel has also varied considerably (in terms of both size and composition) over the run of the series. Typically a season has 23 permanent judges with an additional 12 guest judges for most episodes, with the panel ballooning up to 69 members for Vegas Week and the finale. Executive producer Nigel Lythgoe is the only permanent judge on the panel for all eight seasons. Other permanent judges have included ballroom specialist Mary Murphy, film director and choreographer Adam Shankman and contemporary choreographer Mia Michaels. Guest judge positions are typically filled by choreographers who work regularly on the show -- though choreographers will never develop routines for an episode on which they judge -- who in rare cases may also be former contestants themselves, and by iconic names from the entertainment industry. Guest judges for the show have included: Debbie Allen, Christina Applegate, Robin Antin, Toni Basil, Cicely Bradley, Kristin Chenoweth, Alex Da Silva, Ellen DeGeneres, Tyce Diorio, Joey Dowling, Napoleon and Tabitha D'umo, Carmen Electra, Brian Friedman, Jean-Marc Gnreux, Jason Gilkison, Neil Patrick Harris, Hi-Hat, Katie Holmes, Dan Karaty, Lady Gaga, Lil' C, Rob Marshall, Mandy Moore, Megan Mullally, Kenny Ortega, Toni Redpath, Debbie Reynolds, Wade Robson, Doriana Sanchez, Shane Sparks, Sonya Tayeh, Olisa Thompson, Stacey Tookey, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and Travis Wall. There has been some variation in how long into a season the judges have retained their ability to make the ultimate decision on who is eliminated from week to week; typically this ability is lost around week 5 of the competitive phase of the show, but in seasons seven and eight the format has seen the judges retain this ability until relatively late in the competition, at week 7.
 In both seasons 7 and 8, the judges decided not to eliminate any dancers on the occasion of one results show; in both cases this event was followed by the elimination of double the normal amount of contestants the following week. Similarly, for format reasons, season 9 featured two shows with double eliminations, with four dancers eliminated instead of two.
 The seasons 8 and 9 dancer showcase episodes have been combined with the Top 20 reveal episode, with groups of the dancers performing immediately after being revealed as contestants.Over the course of its nine seasons, So You Think You Can Dance has featured dozens of distinct dance styles in its choreographed routines. Most of these styles fall into four categories that are regularly showcased and can be found in almost every performance episode: western contemporary/classical styles, ballroom styles, hip-hop/street styles, and Jazz and its related styles. Various other forms of dance that do not especially fall into these broad categories are seen as well, but not as regularly. The following styles have all been seen in a choreographed duet or group routine; styles featured only in auditions or solos are not listed.Routines from the classically-derived style of contemporary dance are the most common dances seen on the show, being seen in every performance episode of the series (and typically at least twice per episode). While contemporary, lyrical, and modern dance are typically considered three separate (if overlapping) styles, the practice on So You Think You Can Dance has been to refer to all routines in this area as "contemporary", except in the first season where the label "lyrical" was used for the same purpose. Ballet routines occur much more rarely, at a rate of one or two per season since their introduction in the fourth season.Hip-hop routines are also present in every performance episode. While these routines frequently feature elements from many different sub-genres of hip-hop (locking and popping, for example) and various "street" styles (such as breaking), they are typically all labelled under the umbrella term of hip-hop. An exception is the now frequently-featured lyrical hip-hop, which is unique amongst all the styles on SYTYCD in that it is the only one that is held to have become a known distinct style at least in-part as a result of the show; the style is widely attributed to regular show choreographers Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo and the term itself to judge Adam Shankman. These two broad categories are occasionally supplemented by krump routines, which have been featured a few times a season since their introduction in season 2. Additionally the styles of breakdancing (in the sense of a full breaking routine as opposed to a hip-hop routine with a few breaking tricks), waacking, and stepping have all been featured in exactly one routine.Ballroom styles are also seen regularly in every performance episode; these dances may be traditional European-derived styles or Latin-American styles or a mix of the two.Jazz is featured in nearly all performance episodes. While these routines are typically labelled simply "Jazz", the genre is notable as being one of the most fusional featured on the show and various style combinations and sub-categories have been referenced. Descended from Jazz but treated as a separate genre on SYTYCD, "Broadway" is analogous to the label "Musical Theater" outside the U.S.These dance styles are featured less frequently than their ballroom relatives, but have been seen intermittently since the first season.In addition to the broad categories above, many more styles that are less common in the U.S. are sometimes featured. Most of these are seen only once, but the Bollywood style has been featured several times per season since the fourth season.^1 These dancers never appeared in the bottom six or bottom four dancers at any point.
^2 Season 6's finale featured six grand finalists.
^3 Season 7's finale featured three grand finalists.
^4 Season 9 will feature two winners: a male and a female.The second season premiered on May 12, 2006. The top 20 finalists were revealed on June 8, and the winner, Benjamin Schwimmer, was named "America's Favorite Dancer" on August 16, 2006 after 16 million votes were collected for the season finale. Travis Wall was the first runner-up, and Donyelle Jones was named second runner-up.Benji Schwimmer almost did not make the show's top 20  he was officially first runner-up dancer in case any of the male dancers ran into unforeseen difficulties prior to the start of filming. As it happened, for the second year in a row, Hokuto Konishi was unable to get his visa cleared to work in the U.S. in time for the first taping, and he was cut. Schwimmer took his spot in the Top 20 and fared well from the start, garnering consistent praise from the judges and votes from viewers. Schwimmer and fellow grand finalist Donyelle Jones, who were paired as a couple from the first performance episode, became the first contestants in the show's run to never face elimination from being in the bottom six or bottom 4 dancers.There were several changes to the show's format in the second season. This season was the first to feature two episodes per week, splitting the bulk of the performances and the voting results segments between two nights. New styles of dance were also introduced, and the winning prize was increased from US$100,000 to $250,000 and also included a new car and a one-year contract to perform in a Cline Dion show then performing Las Vegas. The season was also the first followed by a live tour for the top ten dancers.Open auditions for season 3 began early October 2006, held in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. Like the previous season, those that made the cuts moved on to Las Vegas. The taped auditions premiered on the Fox Network on May 24, 2007, and the subsequent shows were taped and broadcast live for a 12-week season. Cat Deeley returned as host, and Nigel Lythgoe returned as permanent judge. Joining Lythgoe permanently at the judging table was Mary Murphy; her promotion was reported by TV Guide on March 8, 2007. Lacey Schwimmer, younger sister of season 2 winner Benji Schwimmer and cousin of season 2 fourth-place finisher Heidi Groskreutz, auditioned for this season (with her brother partnering her during the audition) and made the Top 20. She was the only contestant in the finals to have never been in the Bottom 3 couples or Bottom 4 individuals, ultimately placing fourth in the finale (the same position her cousin Heidi finished the previous season); the professional recognition from this finish led to her joining the cast of the seventh season of Dancing With the Stars. The prize for the winner was increased to $250,000 cash. On the performance finale show (August 16, 2007), it was announced that the series had been picked up for a fourth season. Sabra Johnson was named "America's Favorite Dancer," while Danny Tidwell (brother of season 2 runner-up Travis Wall) was named runner-up.Auditions for Season 4 began in Texas on January 17 and took place in six locations through March 2008. The show kicked off its two-hour season premiere on May 22, 2008.[2] Cat Deeley returned as host and Nigel Lythgoe and Mary Murphy as permanent judges. This season saw the introduction of new dance styles, including Bollywood, and new choreographers, including hip-hop duo Tabitha and Napoleon D'umo. The prize for the winner was again $250,000 cash, the title of "America's Favorite Dancer" and an offer for a role in Step Up 3D. In the finale, viewers voted Joshua Allen as the overall winner, while Katee Shean was given a surprise award of $50,000 for being the top female dancer.[3]Auditions for Season 5 kicked off in New York City on November 13, 2008 and continued on to Miami, Los Angeles, Denver, Memphis, and Seattle. The premiere aired on May 21, 2009. Louis van Amstel joined the show's cast of choreographers and Shane Sparks returned to choreograph while on break from America's Best Dance Crew. The prize for the winner was once again $250,000 cash, the chance to be on the November 2009 issue cover of Dance Spirit Magazine, and the title of "America's Favorite Dancer." On August 6, 2009 (the finale), Jeanine Mason was given the title.After a low-rated special episode of Dance featuring Lythgoe presenting his and viewer's favorite dance routines from seasons 15, the sixth season of Dance, premiered on Wednesday, September 9, 2009.[4] Auditions were held in Boston, Atlanta, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City.[5] Adam Shankman joined as the permanent judge for the first time this season. The winner was Russell Ferguson and the runner-up was Jakob Karr.Auditions began in Miami, Florida, on January 18, 2010, continuing through New York, Dallas, Nashville, and Chicago, ending in Los Angeles on March 26. The season premiered on May 27, 2010. This season introduced significant format changes to the show, with a Top 11 dancers instead of the traditional Top 20 and "All-Stars", contestants from previous seasons who returned to partner with the Top 11 for a portion of their routines. Lauren Froderman won this season with Kent Boyd as runner-up.Auditions started October 13, 2010 in Oakland, California and continued through November 15 in Brooklyn, New York. The premiere aired on May 26, 2011.The series began a new version of the "All-Star" format in which the All Stars didn't come in until the top 10. The show returned to a top 20 with couples. This season also marks the first time that the public can cast votes online, in addition to calling in, with a limit of 50 votes per viewer. On August 11, 2011, it was announced that Melanie Moore was the winner of season 8 and Sasha Mallory the runner-up. Together they received 79% of the 11.5 million votes.On October 6, 2011, Fox announced that it had renewed So You Think You Can Dance for a ninth season, which premiered on May 24, 2012. In January 2012, Lythgoe announced that the result shows had been cut by Fox.[6] On May 18th, 2012, Nigel Lythgoe announced that two winners will be crowned: a male and a female.[7]On September 2, 2009, as prelude to season 6, a special show aired featuring judge picks for the top 15 routines from the first five seasons. At the end of the show, show creator and judge Nigel Lythgoe presented his favorite performance, a contemporary piece choreographed by Tyce Diorio and performed by Melissa Sandvig and Ade Obayomi.So You Think You Can Dance premiered with over 10 million viewers in 2005. For Season 1, it was the No. 1 summer show on television. However, when NBC's America's Got Talent premiered in the summer of 2006, it took the title of "#1 summer show" and, over the past few years, has broadened its lead. In summer 2009, SYTYCD premiered strong with a 3.4 rating in its target demographic, although with the start of America's Got Talent roughly a month later in the same timeslot, Dance fell to No. 4 on the ratings board. It continued to lose viewers throughout the summer of 2009 and ended up with an average of approximately 8 million viewers. Fox then moved SYTYCD to its fall 2009 schedule where its ratings continued to decline; hitting an all time series low of 4.6 million viewers for a "special" episode hosted by Nigel Lythgoe on September 2, 2009. The move to the fall was short-lived. After dropping to an average of 6 million viewers, Fox moved SYTYCD back to the summer in 2010. With Mia Michaels replacing Mary Murphy and former contestants termed as "all stars" being used as partners, the ratings for Dance continued to slide to all-time series lows; dropping to just 5.6 million viewers on July 15, 2010. For Season 7, So You Think You Can Dance averaged just over 5 million viewers. Soon after the season 7 finale, it was announced that Mia Michaels would be replaced on the judge's panel by returning personality Mary Murphy. The change appeared to have little effect on the ratings and the show continued to average just over five million viewers per episode in 2011's season 8. Season 9 saw a slight uptake in ratings early on, with each of the season's first five episodes garnering between six and seven million viewers, but the rise was short-lived and the show's ratings hit an all time low of 4.16 millions viewers on August 29, 2012.Dance competition had been a part of American television for decades before the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, but usually in the form of all-around talent searches, (such as Star Search, Soul Train, or Showtime at the Apollo). However, a season-long American Idol-like talent-search show with a sole focus on dance had never been broadcast on American network television. Producers and judges associated with the show have stated on numerous occasions, both within the context of the show and in interviews, that the series was meant to rejuvenate the visibility and appreciation of dance as an art form in the U.S. and to give exposure to struggling dancers. Series judge Mary Murphy says, for example, "Of course you hope you can make a living at it, because you don't want to give up on something that you do, but the honest truth is most dancers have to carry one or two jobs and dance as much as they can on the side -- it's a very lucky dancer who gets a full scholarship."[8] A number of dance-themed competition shows have been produced for American television since the premiere of So You Think You Can Dance, including America's Best Dance Crew, Superstars of Dance, and Live to Dance.In 2009, Lythgoe came together with fellow SYTYCD judge Adam Shankman as well as Katie Holmes, Carrie Ann Inaba, and others in the dance entertainment industry, in an effort to launch The Dizzyfeet Foundation, with the aim of providing scholarships and training to young dancers of limited means.[9] The foundation has been referenced sporadically on the show since. In 2010, Lythgoe, with the assistance of other SYTYCD personalities and long-time healthy lifestyles proponent Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, was successful in getting another of his dance-oriented concepts realized -- an official National Dance Day, held now annually on the last Saturday of July, to promote fitness through movement.[10] This national dance day has been celebrated annually by the show since.[11]Before the end of 2005, the year the series first premiered, its format had already been licensed for the first of a number foreign adaptations. To date, the resulting So You Think You Can Dance franchise has produced 23 shows representing 24 different countries and comprising over 65 individual seasons. These adaptations have aired in Armenia, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Israel, Lithuania, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and Vietnam.Similar shows:So You Think You Can Dance at TV.com1 Show format

Adams. The 12-episode first season debuted on June 23, 2011, with a 90-minute premiere.[1][2] It was renewed for a second season of 16 episodes on August 11, 2011 which premiered on June 14, 2012 with the mid-season finale on August 23, 2012. The remaining 6 episodes of Season 2 will begin airing in January 2013.[3][4][5][6] On October 12, 2012, USA Network renewed Suits for a third season, to consist of 16 episodes.[7]Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) is a brilliant college dropout whose dream of becoming an attorney was derailed after he was expelled. With his natural intelligence and eidetic memory, he makes a living taking the LSAT for others. To make the money he needs to keep his grandmother in a private nursing home, he agrees to deliver a case of marijuana for his best friend Trevor (Tom Lipinski). Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht) is one of New York City's top corporate lawyers and is promoted to senior partner at the Pearson Hardman law firm. He is forced by company policy to hire an associate attorney. Mike discovers that the drug delivery is a sting operation and escapes the police by accidentally sitting for an interview with Harvey. Harvey is impressed with Mike's quick wits, encyclopedic knowledge of law, and genuine desire to be an attorney; he hires Mike and pretends that Mike is a Harvard Law graduate. Only Harvey's legal secretary and confidant Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty) knows the secret.At the firm, junior partner Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), Harvey's jealous rival and direct supervisor of the associates, is suspicious of Mike's Harvard credentials. Meanwhile, Mike struggles to distance himself from Trevor, who has stopped dealing drugs but cannot escape his past. When Trevor leaves the state, Mike begins dating Trevor's ex-girlfriend Jenny Griffith (Vanessa Ray). Mike befriends paralegal Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle) at the office, and the two soon develop a mutual attraction, complicating his relationship with Jenny. Trevor returns to New York, only to learn that Mike is dating Jenny. In retaliation, he tells the firm's managing partner Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) about Mike's lack of a degree.In the season premiere, founder Daniel Hardman (David Costabile) returns to the firm, and Jessica and Harvey fear he wishes to return to his former position as managing partner. Because of this, Jessica allows Mike to continue working, despite discovering his secret. Meanwhile, Jenny confronts Mike about his feelings for Rachel, and when Mike hesitates in his response, Jenny breaks up with him. At the firm, Travis Tanner (Eric Close) accuses Harvey of burying evidence and is determined to have Harvey disbarred. Donna learns that she signed in the document and then lost it; she panics and destroys the document. She is fired by Jessica shortly after. Hardman is able to blackmail Tanner into dropping Harvey's disbarment from the settlement, and Hardman's decision to settle or Jessica's decision to go to trial is put to vote. When the partners are evenly divided on the issue, Harvey, who has the deciding vote, realizes the trial will jeopardize everyone at the firm and votes to settle, unwillingly siding with Hardman over Jessica so the firm can move past the lawsuit. This causes Hardman to call a partner vote and challenge Jessica for the position of managing partner. Soon after, Hardman promotes Louis to senior partner, and both Harvey and Jessica fail to definitively win Louis' support. Hardman becomes managing partner, but it is short lived as Mike and Harvey discover that Hardman forged and planted the document that Harvey and Donna supposedly buried. He is voted out of the firm, and Jessica regains the managing partner position. Immediately after his grandmother's death, Mike tries to start a relationship with Rachel, but she is reluctant. Instead, he sleeps with his childhood friend Tess (Elisabeth Hower) who was in town for the funeral, only to be discovered by Rachel, who has just decided that she was willing to have a relationship with him.On October 12, 2012, USA Network renewed Suits for a third season, to consist of 16 episodes. [7][8]Suits first appeared on USA network's development slate under the title A Legal Mind in April 2010.[14] In May, the network placed a cast-contingent pilot order from a pilot script written by Aaron Korsh.[15] Patrick J. Adams was cast in the lead role of Mike Ross in July 2010.[16] In late July, Gabriel Macht joined the cast as Harvey Specter, the attorney who hires Mike.[17] Rick Hoffman came on board in mid-August to portray Harvey's competition at the law firm.[18] Meghan Markle and Gina Torres completed the main cast in late August.[19] Torres was cast as Jessica Pearson, the managing partner at the firm, and Markle portrays Rachel Zane, a paralegal who has an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. The pilot was filmed in New York City in fall 2010.[20][21]The network gave a green-light to the series with a 12-episode order on January 19, 2011. The series began filming in Toronto, Ontario on April 25, 2011, and completed August 12, 2011.[22][23]"Greenback Boogie" by Ima Robot is the theme song of the show. It was released as a single on September 18, 2010, and is included on the band's third album, Another Man's Treasure.Suits received a score of 60 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating mixed or average reviews.[24] Ginia Bellafante, a critic for The New York Times, gave the pilot a positive review: "A new legal series beginning on Thursday on USA, erupts from a Mount Vesuvius of absurdities, and yet like so much else in the USA stable, it comes in relatively good faithnot merely with a snappy sense of its own fun, but also with a chipper belief in the viability of renewal."[25] However, this was not the general consensus, with one reviewer stating that one "might be willing to overlook the show's structural flaws if the cases themselves were wildly compelling, but unfortunately, they are of a piece with their misguided series."[24] However, season two received a score of 73 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews.Critic Alan Sepinwall gave season 1 a critics rating of C with a review saying Rarely, though, have I had as hard a time getting through an inflated USA pilot than I did through all 73 minutes (90 minutes when you factor in commercials) of "Suits". Metacritic users gave season 2 Universal Acclaim with a score of 8.8 and very favorable reviews. Unlike season 1 critics gave season 2 much more positive reviews. David Hinckley a critic for New York Daily News gave Season 2 a review of an 80 saying its popcorn TV well worth settling in to watch. While Daniel Goldberg of Slant Magazine gave it a 63 saying Suits seems perfectly tailored to make its characters all look good, which is simultaneously its most attractive asset and its most discomfiting drawback. Giving it a rating of 75 David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle said Adams and Macht are terrific, with the former loosening up quite considerably this year as Mike....Torres is cool, sexy and commanding as Jessica, and Markle, Hoffman and Rafferty contribute greatly to the energy of the show's core ensemble.In August 2011, the series was renewed for a second season.[26]On December 14, 2011, Patrick J. Adams was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series at the 18th Screen Actors Guild Awards.[27]Suits at TV.com1 Overview

It originated in the United Kingdom, where it was devised as a replacement for Pop Idol. It is now held in various countries. These contestants are aspiring pop singers drawn from public competitive auditions. The programmes are produced by executive producer Simon Cowell and his company SYCOtv. The "X Factor" of the title refers to the undefinable "something" that makes for star quality.[1] The prize is usually a recording contract, in addition to the publicity that appearance in the later stages of the show itself generates, not only for the winner but also for other highly ranked contestants.The UK version is responsible for the launch of the internationally successful artists Leona Lewis, Cher Lloyd, Alexandra Burke and One Direction. As of November 2012, there have been 74 winners of The X Factor around the world, the most recent being Samantha Jade from Australia.Television stations in many countries, especially in Scandinavia, have expressed an interest in showing the UK version, but have not been able to acquire the rights. This is due to legal issues as the British version of the show is only available in the UK and Ireland. The X Factor has completed its eighth UK series.The similarities between The X Factor and Idol prompted Idol creator Simon Fuller, along with 19 Entertainment, to file a lawsuit against Cowell, SYCOtv, and FremantleMedia in 2004. An out-of-court settlement was reached in 2005 allowing Fuller to gain an executive producer status, a 10% share in The X Factor format, and preventing an American version until 2010.[2][3] Fuller later filed a lawsuit again in 2011 after SYCO, FremantleMedia, and Fox Broadcasting Company failed to fulfill the settlement of crediting him as an executive producer of The X Factor USA.[4][5][6][7]Unlike Idol, where the judges only critique the contestants' performances, on The X Factor each judge "mentors" the finalists in a particular category, aiding them with song selection and styling, while also participating together in judging the contestants of the other categories. As well as Idol, new ground-breaking singing show The Voice has become a rival show to The X Factor.The X Factor has been adapted for numerous international versions of the show:Season 1, 2005: Random

Season 3, 2013: Upcoming SeasonSince it was first broadcast in 2004, The X Factor has been the subject of much controversy and criticism in the United Kingdom and many other countries where it was broadcast.Simon Fuller, the creator of Pop Idol, claimed that the format of The X Factor was copied from his own show, and, through his company 19 TV, filed a lawsuit against The X Factor producers FremantleMedia, The X Factor creator Simon Cowell and Cowell's companies Simco and Syco.[8] A High Court hearing began in London in November 2005, and the outcome was awaited with interest by media lawyers for its potential effect on the legal situation regarding the copyrighting of formats. However, in the event the hearing was quickly adjourned[8] and an out-of-court settlement was reached at the end of the month.[9]The Danish version has been criticised by Danish music contract expert and consultant for The Danish Musicians' Association (Dansk Musiker Forbund) Mikael Hjris. According to Hjris, the contracts for participation in the show are unfair for participants and almost amount to serfdom to DR1 (the channel airing the show) stating that clauses in the contracts forbid the participants whether they pass the first round or not from performing or participating in any other musical event for three months. He also criticises that participants are obliged to travel at their own expense.[10]In May 29, 2006, ITV1 broadcast a celebrity version of The X Factor in the UK called The X Factor: Battle of the Stars. It was hosted by Kate Thornton and judged by Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh. It was won by Lucy Benjamin. There has also been a celebrity version in Colombia, El factor X: Batalla de las Estrellas, broadcast in 2006.1 The X Factor around the world2 Disputes and controversies

Scherzinger sent the vote to deadlock to let America's votes determine who would be eliminated. Crow was eliminated, shocking Crow, Scherzinger, and fans. Scherzinger was booed off the stage at the end of the show with many calling for her to be fired[11] and subsequently received death threats from some viewers.[12] It is speculated that this is the main reason for Scherzinger's dismissal as a judge following the season ending.In the season two premiere, Don Philip, someone who once collaborated with Britney Spears, auditioned in front of the judges, and received a "no" from all judges. He then told Access Hollywood that ten minutes of footage from the interview was cut as he says he felt bullied into revealing he was gay.[13] Spears reportedly replied "It is fine that you are gay," though that was edited out as well.[14] Those at Fox then released a statement saying "The judges were not given any information at all about Mr. Philip prior to his audition."[15]List of reality television show franchisesList of television show franchisesChuck Lorre

Don ReoTwo and a Half Men is an American television sitcom that was first broadcast on CBS on September 22, 2003. Starring Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, and Angus T. Jones, the show was originally about a hedonistic jingle writer, Charlie Harper; his uptight brother, Alan; and Alan's growing son, Jake. Charlie's free-wheeling life is complicated when his brother gets divorced and moves, along with his son, into Charlie's beach-front Malibu house. The series' premise was revamped in the ninth season, focusing on Alan moving on with his life after the death of Charlie with help from his new best friend and housemate, Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher), who is also dealing with his own troubles following a bad divorce. Alan, Walden, and Jake eventually bond, becoming close friends, forming a surrogate family unit.In 2010, CBS and Warner Bros. Television reached a multi-year broadcast agreement for the series, renewing it through at least the 201112 season.[1][2] However, on February 24, 2011, CBS and Warner Bros. decided to end production for the rest of the eighth season due to Sheen entering drug rehabilitation and making "disparaging comments" about the show's creator and executive producer, Chuck Lorre.[3] Sheen was officially fired from the show on March 7.[4] The ninth season premiere, "Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt", killed off Sheen's character and introduced Ashton Kutcher as Walden Schmidt, his replacement.[5]In 2011, a blog hosted by The New York Times referred to Two and a Half Men as the "biggest hit comedy of the last decade".[6]On May 12, 2012, CBS Broadcasting Inc. (CBS) renewed Two and a Half Men for a tenth season, following the announcement that CBS had closed a one-year deal with stars Ashton Kutcher, Jon Cryer, and Angus T. Jones.[7][8] In November Jones, like Sheen, made disparaging comments about the show. Jones called it "filth" and urged people not to watch the show, but has since apologized.[9]The series revolved initially around the life of the Harper brothers: Charlie (Charlie Sheen) and Alan (Jon Cryer) and Alan's son, Jake (Angus T. Jones). Charlie is a bachelor who writes commercial jingles for a living while leading a hedonistic lifestyle. When Alan's wife Judith (Marin Hinkle) decides to divorce him, he moves into Charlie's Malibu beach house, with Jake periodically coming to stay. Charlie's housekeeper is Berta (Conchata Ferrell), a sharp-tongued woman who initially resists the change to the household but comes to grudgingly accept it.The first five seasons find Charlie in casual sexual relationships with numerous women until the sixth season, when he becomes engaged to Chelsea (Jennifer Bini Taylor). However, the relationship does not last when Charlie flies to Paris in the eighth season finale in pursuit of Rose (Melanie Lynskey), who was introduced as his stalker in the pilot episode. In the ninth season premiere, it is revealed that Charlie died when he fell in front of a subway train in Paris; it is strongly hinted that Rose allegedly pushes Charlie in front of the train after learning that Charlie had cheated on her.Alan's experiences are somewhat different from Charlie's. Throughout the series, Alan continues to deal with the results of his divorce from Judith, Jake growing up, and his generally little success with women. Even his marriage to Kandi (April Bowlby) at the end of the third season was short-lived. In the fourth season, Alan is back at the beach house paying alimony to two women out of his meager earnings as a chiropractor. In the seventh season, he begins a relationship with Lyndsey McElroy (Courtney Thorne-Smith), the mother of one of Jake's friends. Their relationship is temporarily suspended when Alan accidentally burns down her house and cheats on her, but the relationship eventually resumes.In the ninth season premiere (after Charlie's death) the beach house is sold to Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher), an Internet billionaire in the process of being divorced from his wife Bridget (Judy Greer). Alan leaves to live with his conceited mother Evelyn (Holland Taylor) when the house is sold, but Walden wholeheartedly invites both Alan and Jake back to live in the beach house, needing friends to help him deal with his marriage breakdown, therefore forming a tight-knit surrogate family. Meanwhile, Charlie's spirit now lives on in Hell in the form of a woman (Kathy Bates) as eternal punishment for his womanizing ways during his lifetime. He continues to watch over his brother and nephew, still disgruntled by the fact they won't leave his former home.At the end of the ninth season, Jake joined the army and only appears occasionally during season ten. In the tenth season Walden proposed to his English girlfriend Zoey ([[Sophie Winkleman) only to be turned down after he found out there was another man, because of this he became depressed. Meanwhile Alan gets engaged to his girlfriend Lyndsey.Following a February 2010 announcement that Sheen was entering drug rehabilitation, filming of the show was put on hiatus,[10] but resumed the following month.[11] On April 1, 2010, People.com reported that after seven seasons, Sheen announced he was considering leaving the show.[12] According to one source, Sheen quit the show after filming the final episode of season 7, purportedly due to his rejection of CBS's offer of $1million per episode as too low.[13] Sheen eventually stated that he would be back for two more seasons.[14] On May 18, 2010, the New Zealand website stuff.co.nz reported that a press release issued by Sheen's publicist confirmed that Sheen had signed a new contract for a further two years at $1.78million per episode. "To put a fitting end on the two and one-half months of whirlwind speculation, I'm looking forward to returning to my CBS home on Monday nights," Sheen was quoted as saying.[15]On January 28, 2011, Sheen entered a rehabilitation center voluntarily for the third time in 12 months. According to Warner Bros. Television and CBS, the show was put on hiatus for an unknown amount of time.[16] The following month, after Sheen's verbal attacks against Chuck Lorre during a radio interview with Alex Jones and an online interview with TMZ.com, CBS announced that Two and a Half Men would cease production for the rest of its eighth season,[17] affecting an estimated 200 employees,[18] and causing Warner Bros., Lorre, Sheen, and other profit participants not to receive about $10million from the lost eight remaining episodes.[19] Afterwards, Sheen was interviewed on ABC's 20/20, NBC's Today, and CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight, continuing to make hostile comments about Lorre, as well as CBS.[20] On March 7, CBS and Warner Bros. Television jointly announced that Sheen had been fired from Two and a Half Men, citing "moral turpitude" as a main cause of separation.[5] No decision about the future of the show was announced at that time.Cast members Marin Hinkle and Holland Taylor expressed sadness at Sheen's departure and personal problems.[21] Jon Cryer did not publicly comment on the matter and in response, Sheen called him "a turncoat, a traitor, [and] a troll" in an E! Online interview,[22] although he later issued a "half-apology" to Cryer for the remarks.[23] Sheen sued Lorre and Warner Bros. Television for $100million, claiming that he had filed the lawsuit on behalf of himself and Two and a Half Men's cast and crew; however, only Sheen was named as a plaintiff in court documents.[24]In April 2011, Sheen mentioned during a radio interview after his tour's stop in Boston that he and CBS were talking about a possible return to the show.[25] Regardless, Lorre announced that same month that he had developed an idea for a Two and a Half Men reboot that would exclude Sheen and have Cryer in a key role alongside a new character.[26] On May 13, CBS announced that Ashton Kutcher would join the cast. Kutcher was quoted as saying, "I can't replace Charlie Sheen but I'm going to work my ass off to entertain the hell out of people!"[27]On August 2, 2011 it was reported that the season nine premiere would begin with Sheen's character having been killed off and his ex-girlfriends attending his funeral. Afterwards, Charlie's Malibu home would be put up for sale and interested buyers would include celebrities from Lorre's other sitcoms, and John Stamos as well as Kutcher's character, Walden Schmidt, "an Internet billionaire with a broken heart." Critics compared this situation to what happened in 1987 to Valerie Harper, who was also fired from the sitcom, Valerie (later titled Valerie's Family: The Hogans and then The Hogan Family), also had her character killed off-screen, and was also replaced by someone else, Sandy Duncan, the following season.[28][29][30][31]Rather than grieving over the death of his character, Sheen said he would watch his "fake funeral attended by [his] fake ex-girlfriends, from [his] very, very real movie theater, with [his] very real hotties in tow."[32][33] Sheen's response to the season 9 premiere was very positive.[34] He reportedly felt Charlie Harper's funeral was "eerie but fun". Sheen also felt that the reveal of Kutcher's character in a cloud of his own character's ashes was particularly enjoyable.[35]The attention Two and a Half Men received from Kutcher's arrival benefited the show's popularity. Average total viewers during the 20112012 season rose 13% to 15 million, and the 5.2 rating in the 1849 demographic rose by 27%.[36] His debut as the character Walden Schmidt, entitled "Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt", was seen by 28.7 million people on September 19, 2011. The Nielsen ratings company reported that figure was more than any episode in the show's first eight seasons, when Sheen starred in it. At the 2012 Emmys Two and a Half Men was nominated for four awards winning 3 of them, the most Emmys the show has won in a single year since the show began. Kutcher replaced Sheen as the highest-paid U.S. actor in 2012, receiving $700,000 per episode.On November 26, 2012, TMZ.com aired a video made by Angus Jones in which he proclaimed the show was "filth" that is opposed to his "deep Christian values" and he said he didn't want to be on the show and wished his fans would not watch it.[37]Guest stars have included:As part of a crossover from the writers and executive producer of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, George Eads made a brief cameo appearance on the May 5, 2008 episode.[42]Charlie Sheen's real-life brother Emilio Estevez has guest-starred as an old friend of Charlie's;[43] his father Martin Sheen has appeared as Rose's father. Sam Sheen, the real-life daughter of Denise Richards and Charlie Sheen, has appeared as Lisa's daughter on November 22, 2004.[44]Each episode's title is a dialogue fragment from the episode itself, usually offering no clue to the episode's actual plotline. The show's 100th episode ("City of Great Racks") aired on October 15, 2007. To celebrate this, a casino-inspired party was held at West Hollywood's Pacific Design Center.[56] Warner Brothers Television also distributed blue Micargi Rover bicycles adorned with the Two and a Half Men logo along with the words "100 Episodes." Each bicycle came with a note saying, "You've made us very proud. Here's to a long ride together."[56] The cast also gave the crew sterling silver key rings from Tiffany & Co. The key rings were attached to small pendants with "100" inscribed on one side and Two and a Half Men on the other.All seasons except 5, 7 and 8 consist of 24 episodes. Season 5 was narrowed down to 19 episodes due to 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike. Due to Sheen's personal life problems, Season 7 was narrowed down to 22 episodes. Season 8 premiered on September 20, 2010, at 9:00p.m. ET. CBS initially ordered 24 episodes for the season, but due to Sheen's personal life, the show was put on hiatus after 16 episodes were produced, with production scheduled to resume on February 28. After a series of comments made by Sheen on February 24, 2011, CBS and Warner Bros. cancelled the remainder of the season (episodes 1724).On May 13, 2011, it was widely reported that actor Ashton Kutcher would be replacing Charlie Sheen as the lead on the show.[57] The show's ninth season premiered on September 19, 2011. The first episode, "Nice to Meet You, Walden Schmidt", begins with Charlie Harper's funeral, and introduces Kutcher as billionaire Walden Schmidt, who buys Harper's house. On May 12, 2012, CBS renewed Two and a Half Men for a tenth season, moving it to Thursday nights at 8:30pm, following The Big Bang Theory.[58][59]Two and a Half Men entered local United States broadcast syndication in 2007, with the first eight seasons available to local stations (largely CW affiliates in the major U.S. TV markets through major deals with Tribune Broadcasting and the Sinclair Broadcast Group[60]). On September 6, 2010, FX began airing the series daily on cable television nationwide.Syndicated shows are sold in multi-year cycles, with the first cycle the most expensive. Two and a Half Men's first cycle is nine years in length. If there had been no ninth season because of Sheen's departure, due to the first cycle's premature end Warner Bros. would not have received about $80million in license fees. While local stations would prefer to have as many episodes as possible available to them, an early start to the second cycle would lower the cost of the show for them.[19]RTL 2"When Chuck pitched the idea to me ... I thought it was an intriguing idea and walked into Naren's office and he said, 'What a nut.'"In 2007, Two and a Half Men creator Chuck Lorre contacted CSI: Crime Scene Investigation executive producer Carol Mendelsohn about a crossover. At first, the idea seemed unlikely to receive approval; however, it resurfaced when Mendelsohn and Lorre were at the World Television Festival in Canada and they decided to get approval and run with it.[147] When Mendelsohn was giving a talk, she accidentally mentioned the crossover, that same day Variety Magazine was already inquiring about the crossover episodes. Mendelsohn later stated: "We're all used to being in control and in charge of our own shows and even though this was a freelance-type situation ... there was an expectation and also a desire on all of our parts to really have a true collaboration. You have to give a little. It was sort of a life lesson, I think."[147]"The biggest challenge for us was doing a comedy with a murder in it. Generally our stories are a little lighter," stated Lorre in an interview. "Would our audience go with a dead body in it? There was a moment where it could have gone either way. I think the results were spectacular. It turned out to be a really funny episode."[147]The Two and a Half Men episode "Fish in a Drawer" was the first part of the crossover to air, on May 5, 2008, written by CSI writers Sarah Goldfinger, Evan Dunsky, Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar.[148] George Eads is the only CSI: Crime Scene Investigation cast member to make a cameo in this episode.Three days later the second part of the crossover aired, the CSI episode "Two and a Half Deaths". Gil Grissom (William Petersen) investigated the murder of a sitcom diva named Annabelle (Katey Sagal), who was found murdered while she was filming her show in Las Vegas.[148] The episode was written by Two and a Half Men creators Lorre and Aronsohn; Sheen, Cryer, and Jones all make uncredited cameos in this episode as themselves, in the same clothes their characters were wearing in "Fish in a Drawer".At the end of 2010 film Due Date, a scene from Two and a Half Men is shown, in which Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, and Angus T. Jones appear as their characters, while Ethan Chase (played by Zach Galifianakis in the movie) plays Stu, Jake's tutor.[149]The New York Daily News has described the sitcom as "solid, well-acted and occasionally funny."[150] Conversely Graeme Blundell, writing for The Australian, described it as a "sometimes creepy, misogynistic comedy".[151] Ashton Kutchers debut was met with mixed reviews,[152] and reviews for season 9 were also mixed.[153]The show has received multiple award nominations. It was nominated for 30 Primetime Emmy Awards (winning four technical awards and two for Jon Cryer as Alan Harper), and has also received two Golden Globe nominations. The show won the "Favorite TV Comedy" award at the 35th People's Choice Awards.Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of Two and a Half Men on CBS.Note: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.Two and a Half Men at TV.comCo-executive producers:David RichardsonMichael Collier1 Overview2 Production

Set and produced in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Breaking Bad is the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer at the beginning of the series. He turns to a life of crime, producing and selling methamphetamine with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), with the aim of securing his family's financial future before he dies.[1]Premiering on January 20, 2008, the series is broadcast in the United States and Canada on the cable channel AMC, and is a production of Sony Pictures Television. On August 14, 2011, AMC announced that Breaking Bad had been renewed for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes.[2] This final season is split into two parts, each consisting of 8 episodes and broadcast over the course of two years; the first half premiered on July 15, 2012 and concluded on September 2, 2012, and the second half is scheduled to begin in summer 2013.[3]Breaking Bad has received widespread critical acclaim.[4][5] The series has won seven Primetime Emmy Awardsincluding three consecutive wins for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for Cranston, two wins for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for Paul, and three nominations for Outstanding Drama Series. Cranston has also been nominated twice for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor  Television Series: Drama and he was nominated three times for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series.Breaking Bad was created by Vince Gilligan, who spent several years writing the Fox series The X-Files. Gilligan wanted to create a series in which the protagonist became the antagonist. "Television is historically good at keeping its characters in a self-imposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades," he said. "When I realized this, the logical next step was to think, how can I do a show in which the fundamental drive is toward change?"[4] He added that his goal with Walter White is to turn him from Mr. Chips into Scarface.[5][6][7] He has said it is difficult to write for Walter White because the character is so dark and morally questionable: "I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore."[8] As the series has progressed, Gilligan and the writing staff of Breaking Bad have made Walter increasingly unsympathetic.[5] Gilligan said: "He's going from being a protagonist to an antagonist. We want to make people question who they're pulling for, and why."[6] Cranston said by the fourth season: "I think Walt's figured out it's better to be a pursuer than the pursued. He's well on his way to badass."[7] Gilligan defines the term "breaking bad" as "to raise hell".[9]While still pitching the show to studios, Gilligan was initially discouraged when he learned of the existence of Weeds, and of its similarities to the premise of Breaking Bad. While his producers convinced him that the show was different enough to still be successful, he later claimed that he wouldn't have gone forward with the idea had he known about Weeds earlier.[10]The network originally ordered nine episodes for the first season (including the pilot), but the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike limited the production to seven episodes.[11] The series is set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[12] It is shot on 35 mm film.[13] Breaking Bad reportedly costs $3 million per episode to produce, higher than the average cost for a basic cable program.[14]Vince Gilligan has indicated that he intends to conclude Breaking Bad with the fifth season.[15] In early August 2011, negotiations began over a deal regarding the fifth and possible final season between the network AMC and Sony Pictures Television, the production company of the series. AMC proposed a shortened fifth season (six to eight episodes, instead of 13) to cut costs, but the producers declined. Sony then approached other cable networks about possibly picking up the show if a deal could not be made.[16] On August 14, 2011, a deal was made in which AMC renewed the series for a final 16 episodes.[2]You're going to see that underlying humanity, even when he's making the most devious, terrible decisions, and you need someone who has that humanity  deep down, bedrock humanity  so you say, watching this show, 'All right, I'll go for this ride. I don't like what he's doing, but I understand, and I'll go with it for as far as it goes.' If you don't have a guy who gives you that, despite the greatest acting chops in the world, the show is not going to succeed.Gilligan cast Bryan Cranston for the role of Walter White based on having worked with him in a sixth season episode of the science fiction television series The X-Files. Cranston played an anti-Semitic man with a terminal illness who took series protagonist Fox Mulder hostage. Gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic, and that "Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. I have no idea how he does it."[8][17] AMC network executives were initially hesitant about the casting choice, knowing of Cranston only from his role Hal on the comedy series Malcolm in the Middle, but they were persuaded after Gilligan screened the X-Files episode for them.[18]Gilligan originally intended for Aaron Paul's character, Jesse Pinkman, to be killed at the end of Breaking Bad's first season. Originally, Gilligan wanted Jesse to die in a botched drug deal as a plot device to plague the main protagonist Walter White with guilt. However, Gilligan said by the second episode of the season, he was so impressed with Paul's performance that "it became pretty clear early on that would be a huge, colossal mistake, to kill off Jesse".[19]In an interview with The New York Times, creator Vince Gilligan said the larger lesson of the series is that "actions have consequences".[8] He elaborated on the show's philosophy:If religion is a reaction of man, and nothing more, it seems to me that it represents a human desire for wrongdoers to be punished. I hate the idea of Idi Amin living in Saudi Arabia for the last 25 years of his life. That galls me to no end. I feel some sort of need for biblical atonement, or justice, or something. I like to believe there is some comeuppance, that karma kicks in at some point, even if it takes years or decades to happen. My girlfriend says this great thing thats become my philosophy as well. 'I want to believe there's a heaven. But I can't not believe there's a hell.'In a piece examining the show in comparison to The Sopranos, Mad Men and The Wire, Chuck Klosterman said that Breaking Bad is "built on the uncomfortable premise that there's an irrefutable difference between what's right and what's wrong, and it's the only one where the characters have real control over how they choose to live." Klosterman added that the central question of Breaking Bad is "What makes a man 'bad'  his actions, his motives, or his conscious decision to be a bad person?" Klosterman concluded that, in the world of Breaking Bad, "goodness and badness are simply complicated choices, no different than anything else."[4]Ross Douthat of The New York Times, in a response to Klosterman's piece, compared Breaking Bad and The Sopranos, stating that both series are "morality plays" that are "both interested in moral agency". Douthat went on to say that Walter White and Tony Soprano "represent mirror-image takes on the problem of evil, damnation and free will". Walter as a man who "deliberately abandons the light for the darkness" while Tony is "someone born and raised in darkness" who turns down "opportunity after opportunity to claw his way upward to the light."[30]Gilligan intimated he would inject undertones of black comedy into the fifth season.[31]A recurring motif within the second season is the image of a damaged teddy bear and its missing eye. The teddy bear first appears at the end of the music video "Fallacies" for Jesse's fake band, "TwaghtHammr", which was released as a webisode in February 2009 leading to the second season.[32] A pink teddy bear can also be spotted on the mural on Jane's bedroom wall during the final episode of the second season. It is seen in flashforwards during four episodes, the titles of which, when put together in order, form the following sentence: "Seven Thirty-Seven down over ABQ".[33][34][35] The flashforwards are shot in black and white, with the sole exception of the pink teddy bear, which Vince Gilligan called an homage to the film Schindler's List.[36] At the end of the season, Walter inadvertently helps cause the mid-air collision of two airplanes. The pink teddy bear is then revealed to have fallen out of one of the planes and into the White family's pool. Vince Gilligan called the plane accident an attempt to visualize "all the terrible grief that Walt has wrought upon his loved ones" and "the judgment of God."[37]In the first episode of the third season, the NTSB fishes the teddy bear out of his pool and Walt later finds the missing eye in the pool filter. Television critic Myles McNutt has called it "a symbol of the damage [Walter] feels responsible for,"[38] and The A.V. Club commented that "the pink teddy bear continues to accuse."[39] Fans and critics have compared the appearance of the teddy bear's face to the image of Gus Fring's face in the fourth season finale.[40]The eighth episode of season five is titled "Gliding Over All", which is titled after poem 271 of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, a book which is featured prominently in the series.[41] In previous seasons, Gale Boetticher had given Walt a copy of the book, which has been seen many times since.[42] Prior to giving this gift, Boetticher, an avid Whitman fan, recites "When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer", one of the poems found in Leaves of Grass.[43] In the episode "Bullet Points", Hank finds the initials W.W. written in Boetticher's notes, and jokes with Walt that they are his initials, although Walt quickly attributes them to Whitman.In the episode "Hazard Pay", Walt finds his copy of Leaves of Grass as he is packing up his bedroom, briefly smiles and leaves the book out to read. When Walt discovers the book he is at an especially high time in his life, where he feels that things are coming together and he is succeeding in all ventures. A poem in the book, "Song of Myself," is based on many of these same feelings, furthering the connection between Walt's life and Whitman's poetry.[44] The book plays an especially large role in the episode "Gliding Over All", when Hank finds a copy of Leaves of Grass in Walt's bathroom and opens it to the cover page where he finds the inscription "To my other favorite W.W. It's an honour working with you. Fondly G.B." Hank, who has been working to find out who Boetticher had been working with, attributes the initials to Walt and Boetticher. However, there was speculation that the G.B. could have stood for Walt's former coworker and love interest, Gretchen, as her last name has never been said in the show. Though, series creator Vince Gilligan has debunked this theory.[45]The first season was originally intended to be nine episodes, but due to the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike only seven episodes were filmed.[11] The first season premiered on January 20, 2008, and concluded on March 9, 2008. The complete first season was released on Region 1 DVD on February 24, 2009[46] and Region A Blu-ray on March 16, 2010.[47]A struggling high school chemistry teacher, Walter White (Cranston), is diagnosed with inoperable, advanced lung cancer. On a ride along with his DEA agent brother-in-law Hank (Dean Norris), Walter sees a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman (Paul), fleeing the scene of a meth lab. He later contacts Jesse and devises a scheme to become partners in an attempt to combine their skills to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine. Walter says he wants to provide financial stability for his pregnant wife, Skyler (Gunn) and disabled son, and to pay for his expensive cancer treatment. During Walter and Jesse's first days of selling Albuquerque's finest meth, they encounter a series of problems with local drug dealers.On May 7, 2008, AMC announced that Breaking Bad was renewed for a second, 13-episode season.[48] Production began in July 2008, and the season premiered on March 8, 2009 and concluded on May 31, 2009.[49] The complete second season was released on Region 1 DVD and Region A Blu-ray on March 16, 2010.[46]Walter continues to find himself facing insurmountable medical bills from his cancer treatment. Despite having had several bad experiences while producing meth with Jesse, Walter agrees to rejoin his partner. The two begin producing meth but run into multiple problems. Jesse's friend Badger (Matt L. Jones) is arrested while selling meth in a sting operation. Walter hires a lawyer, Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), to help Badger. Walter and Jesse drive a recreational vehicle into the desert and produce meth for four days. Later, Combo, another of Jesse's friends and distributors, is killed by a rival gang for selling meth on their territory. Saul suggests the two find a new distribution model. Throughout this, Jesse has been building a relationship with his neighbor and landlord, Jane. Jane is revealed to be recovering from addiction, but relapses and the two begin doing heroin. Saul finds them a new business partner, Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), who is willing to pay $1.2 million for the 38 pounds of meth they produced. Walter hastily delivers the product to Gus, but misses his daughter's birth. Walt visits Jesse's house and sees Jane vomiting in her sleep, but does nothing to save her. Skyler confronts Walter about his frequent absences and excuses. She begins to piece together his secret life, and demands that they separate.On April 2, 2009, AMC announced that Breaking Bad was renewed for a third, 13-episode season.[50] It premiered on March 21, 2010, and concluded on June 13, 2010. The complete third season was released on Region 1 DVD and Region A Blu-ray on June 7, 2011.[51]Walter wishes to reunite his family, but Skyler is still suspicious of Walter's second life. Walter believes he can mend the tension between them by confessing to her that he has been producing meth. Skyler is appalled by the confession and demands a formal divorce. Meanwhile, Gus offers to pay Walter three million dollars for three months of his service. He even offers to provide Walter with a state-of-the-art production facility and a brilliant lab assistant, Gale (David Costabile). Jesse is continuing to produce and sell meth by himself. Hank is working with the DEA to investigate Jesse and is slowly gathering evidence to make an arrest. Jesse threatens to report Walter to the police if he is arrested, but Walter offers him Gale's position at the lab. After obtaining the position, Jesse begins stealing meth from the lab and selling it in secret on the side. Jesse gets romantically involved with a woman he meets in his rehab group and learns her kid brother, age 11, was put up by Gus and his street dealers to kill Combo. Jesse decides to avenge Combo. Walter aids Jesse in escaping from Gus's wrath. Gus begins to lose trust in Walter and asks Gale to take over the lab. He orders his henchmen to kill Walter and Jesse. After he is abducted by the henchmen, Walter instructs Jesse to kill Gale in order to become the organization's only chemist.On June 14, 2010, AMC announced Breaking Bad was renewed for a fourth, 13-episode season.[52] Production began in January 2011,[53] the season premiered on July 17, 2011, and concluded on October 9, 2011.[54] Originally, mini episodes of four minutes in length were to be produced before the premiere of the fourth season,[55] but these did not come to fruition.[56]Jesse follows Walter's instructions and murders Gale. Gus decides to discipline the two by enforcing stricter policies at the lab. He also tries to break Walter and Jesse's friendship by assigning them to separate work details. While Walter works in the meth lab, Jesse escorts Mike (Jonathan Banks), one of Guss enforcers, to retrieve payments and provide back-up. Walter and Jesse become increasingly distant and hostile to each other. Meanwhile, Hank, who has been recovering from his last engagement with the cartel, finds evidence linking Gale to Gus. He believes Gus is a major drug distributor and starts looking for tangible evidence to file charges. Gus realizes Walter's close ties with Hank could jeopardize his entire operation. Gus fires Walter and threatens to kill his entire family. Jesse and Walter put their differences aside and agree to murder Gus, convincing former cartel enforcer Hector Salamanca to detonate a suicide bomb; Hector succeeds in this endeavor, killing himself, Gus, and Tyrus, Gus' henchman. Walter and Jesse then proceed to destroy the meth lab and Walter declares to his wife, "I won."On August 14, 2011, AMC announced that Breaking Bad was renewed for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes.[2] Season five is split into two parts, each consisting of 8 episodes. The first half premiered on July 15, 2012, while the second half is scheduled to premiere in summer 2013.[3]The first half of the season focuses on the reviving of Walt and Jesse's meth cooking and dealing. The other important storyline revolves around the deteriorating marriage between Walt and Skyler. Walt's intimidation of his wife eventually leads to Skyler faking a suicide attempt to force her husband's hand and place her children at her sister's home and out of harm's way. Walt, Jesse, and Mike then work hand in hand to revive the meth trade Gus' death has left wide open to Walt and other competitors. Initially, Walt decides that he doesn't wish to end his meth-making career and teams up with Jesse and Mike to start an empire of his own. Mike handles the business end, while Walt and Jesse follow around a team of house fumigators in order to use tented houses as temporary labs. With the DEA following Mike ever closer, Mike decides it is time to get out of the business for good. After Mike refuses to give Walt the ten names of jailed drug connections (nine convicts plus a lawyer) who may implicate them to the DEA, Walt shoots him through his car window, fatally wounding him. Meanwhile, Jesse continues to feel badly about the murder of a boy after a methylamine heist and quits. Walt teams up with Todd, one of the members of the fumigator's crew. Shipping the meth to the Czech Republic proves to be fruitful. Regardless, Skyler asks Walt "how much is enough?" as he has accumulated too much money to count and launder. The first half of the season ends with Hank finding the book that Gale gave to Walt and seeing the line "To my other favorite W.W." on the first page, with a look of realization on his face.Bryan Cranston has hinted that the series may continue after the season 5 finale, stating "Vince (Gilligan) feels that now we have too much story. We could actually go beyond those 16 episodes. It's not far-fetched. I wouldn't mind visiting that possibility. And this is coming from a guy who doesn't know anything of how the show's going to end. If it doesn't end up in a total apocalypse, who knows? Maybe we could revisit Walter White a year down the road and see where his life has gone. If he's still alive, that is."[57]At Comic-Con 2012, Gilligan addressed the possibility, saying: "I love the idea of it [...] But I have to say that my writers and I intend to tell every bit of story we can tell in this final sixteen. So, at this moment in time, I would say that the odds are a bit remote. If we were [to]  a year or two down the line  think of something else [...], who knows? Your guess is as good as mine at this point."[58]He later clarified in an interview on July 18, 2012, that he has no plans for a film, and that Cranston's remarks are the only thing fueling the speculation.[59] But Gilligan has also hinted at a possible spin-off series focusing on lawyer character Saul Goodman.[59]Cast member Betsy Brandt told TODAY.com that, "[t]here is a big director that would like to direct the last episode as a movie and put it in theaters."[60]Breaking Bad has received widespread critical acclaim and has been praised by some critics as the greatest television drama of all time.[4][5] On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season scored 74/100,[61] the second season scored 85/100,[62] the third season scored 89/100[63] the fourth season scored 96/100,[64] and the fifth season so far has been rated at 99/100 as of October 2012[update].[65] The American Film Institute listed Breaking Bad as one of the top ten television series of 2010 and 2011.[66][67]For the first season, the series saw a mostly positive reception. New York Post critic Linda Stasi praised the series, particularly the acting of Cranston and Paul, stating "Cranston and Paul are so good, it's astounding. I'd say the two have created great chemistry, but I'm ashamed to say such a cheap thing."[68] Robert Bianco of USA Today also praised Cranston and Paul, exclaiming "There is humor in the show, mostly in Walt's efforts to impose scholarly logic on the business and on his idiot apprentice, a role Paul plays very well. But even their scenes lean toward the suspenseful, as the duo learns that killing someone, even in self-defense, is ugly, messy work."[69]The second season saw critical acclaim. Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker stated "Bad is a superlatively fresh metaphor for a middle-age crisis: It took cancer and lawbreaking to jolt Walt out of his suburban stupor, to experience life againto take chances, risk danger, do things he didn't think himself capable of doing. None of this would work, of course, without Emmy winner Cranston's ferocious, funny selflessness as an actor. For all its bleakness and darkness, there's a glowing exhilaration about this series: It's a feel-good show about feeling really bad."[70] San Francisco Chronicle's Tim Goodman claimed "The first three episodes of Season 2 that AMC sent out continue that level of achievement with no evident missteps. In fact, it looks as if Gilligan's bold vision for Breaking Bad, now duly rewarded against all odds, has invigorated everyone involved in the project. You can sense its maturity and rising ambition in each episode."[71] Horror novelist Stephen King lauded the series, comparing it to the likes of Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet.[72]The third season also saw critical acclaim. Time proclaimed "It's a drama that has chosen the slow burn over the flashy explosion, and it's all the hotter for that choice."[73] Newsday stated Breaking Bad was still TV's best series and it stayed true to itself.[74] Tim Goodman praised the writing, acting, and cinematography, pointing out the "visual adventurousness" of the series. Goodman went on to call the show's visuals "a combination of staggering beauty  the directors make use of numerous wide-angle landscape portraits  and transfixing weirdness."[75] After the finale aired, The A.V. Club said that season three was "one of television's finest dramatic accomplishments. And what makes it so exciting  what makes the recognition of the current golden age so pressing  is that the season has not been, as [another reviewer] put it in another context, 'television good.' The heart-in-the-throat quality of this season comes as much from the writers' exhilarating disregard for television conventions as from the events portrayed."[76]Season four won universal critical acclaim. The Boston Globe referred to the show as a "taut exercise in withheld disaster" and declared the show "riveting".[77] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette labelled the series "smart and thought provoking that elevates the artistic achievements of the medium".[78] Season four was listed by many critics as one of the best seasons of television in 2011.[79] Time listed Walter White's "I am the one who knocks" line as one of the best television lines of 2011.[80] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette listed it as the best series of 2011 while noting that, "Breaking Bad is that rare TV series that has never made a seriously damaging storytelling misstep."[81] The A.V. Club's review of the finale summed it up as a "fantastically fitting end for a season that ran in slow motion, starting and continuing with so many crises begging for resolution week after week. Now the decks are cleared, but that doesn't mean anybody is home free. Nothing's ever easy on Breaking Bad." The reviewer continued to exalt the season, and proclaimed, "What a season of television  truly something none of us could ever have expected, or claimed we deserved."[82] Best-selling author Noah Charney called it "the best show on television" and compared it to great works of literature for its three-dimensional characters and combination of action, drama, and dark comedy.[83]The series has won numerous awards and nominations, including seven Primetime Emmy Awards and three Outstanding Drama Series nominations. For his portrayal of Walter White, Bryan Cranston won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010.[84] Cranston also won the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama in 2009 and the Satellite Award for Best Actor  Television Series: Drama in 2008, 2009, and 2010, as well as the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series and the Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television in 2012. Aaron Paul won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010 and 2012. Paul also won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television in 2010 and 2012. For his work on season four, Giancarlo Esposito won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. In 2010 and 2012, Breaking Bad won the TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Drama. In 2009 and 2010, the series won the Satellite Award for Best Television Series  Drama, along with the Saturn Award for Best Syndicated/Cable Television Series in 2010, 2011, and 2012. In 2012, the series won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay  Dramatic Series. Overall, the show has won 35 industry awards and been nominated for 117.[85]Breaking Bad at TV.comStewart LyonsSam CatlinJohn ShibanPeter GouldGeorge MastrasThomas SchnauzBryan CranstonMoira Walley-BeckettKaren MoorePatty LinKelley DixonSkip MacDonaldLynne Willingham1 Production

Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he "...should really focus on doing something else. But I think any good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it, because you can ease the tension to an audience when it's necessary, and then build it back up again. Walt White has no clue he's occasionally funny, but as an actor I recognize when there are comedic moments and opportunities."[20]Anna Gunn as Skyler White Walter's wife who was pregnant with their second child prior to his diagnosis, and who becomes increasingly suspicious of her husband after he begins behaving in unfamiliar ways. Gunn sees Skyler as "grounded, tough, smart and driven". Gunn sees Skyler's stalled writing career as her biggest dream, saying "I think she really deep down yearns to be an artist and to be creative and productive."[21]Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman Walter's former student, Pinkman is a drug dealer who partners up with Walt and makes high-level meth. Paul sees Jesse as a funny kid. "He's just this lost soul I don't think he's a bad kid, he just got mixed in the wrong crowd." Paul elaborated on the character's background, saying "He doesn't come from an abusive, alcoholic background. But maybe he just didn't relate to his father, maybe his father was too strict and too proper for Jesse." Paul compared the character's relationship with Walt to The Odd Couple.[22]Dean Norris as Hank Schrader Walter's DEA agent brother-in-law. Hank has been described as the "comic relief." Norris, who has played several cops before in film and television, stated "Having played so many cops, I've talked with a lot of technical advisers, so I've been able to pick up a lot. Coincidentally, one of my best friends growing up is a cop in Chicago, and one of my other best friends out in LA is a sheriff. So I get to see all the components of that culture."[23]Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader Hank's wife and Skyler's kleptomaniac sister. Brandt described Marie as "an unpleasant bitch", but also stated there was more to her than that. "I think we're seeing more of it now that she would be there for her family. But it's all about her."[24]RJ Mitte as Walter White, Jr. Walter and Skyler's son, has cerebral palsy. He begins lashing out after Walter's cancer announcement. Like Walter Jr., Mitte has cerebral palsy, although his is a milder form.[25] Mitte stated he had to regress from his therapy to portray the character, staying up late into the night to slur his speech and learned to walk on crutches so his walking wouldn't look fake.[26]Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman (recurring season 2, main cast season 35) a crooked strip mall lawyer who represents Walt and Jesse. Odenkirk based his character on film producer Robert Evans. "I thought about Robert Evans because I've listened to The Kid Stays in the Picture on CD. He's constantly switching up his cadence and his delivery. He emphasizes interesting words. He has loads of attitude in almost every line that he says. So when I rehearse the scenes alone I do my impersonation of Robert Evans to find those moments and turns. Then I go out and I do Saul."[27]Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo "Gus" Fring (recurring season 2, main cast season 34) a high level drug distributor who has a cover as a fast food chain owner. Esposito stated for the third season, he incorporated his yoga training in his performance. "Gus is the coolest cucumber that ever walked the Earth. I think about Eddie Olmos way back in Miami Vice. He was like dead he was hardly breathing. I thought, how is this guy just standing in this fire and doing nothing? Gus has totally allowed me that level of flexibility and relaxation not because he has ultimate power and he knows he can take someone's life. He's just confident."[28]Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut (recurring season 2, main cast season 35) an all-purpose cleaner and hitman who works for Gus. The character of Mike has been compared to Harvey Keitel's Winston Wolf character in Pulp Fiction, which Banks says he isn't trying to emulate: "I immediately tried to put it out of my mind, quite honestly. His cleaner ain't my cleaner. But throughout this world, you would suspect there had been a great many cleaners, whether government-run or individual contractors."[29]Official websiteOfficial Sony Pictures websiteBreaking Bad at the Internet Movie DatabaseThe template Tv.com is being considered for deletion.True Blood is an American television series created and produced by Alan Ball. It is based on The Southern Vampire Mysteries series of novels by Charlaine Harris, detailing the co-existence of vampires and humans in Bon Temps, a fictional, small town in northwestern Louisiana. The series centers on the adventures of Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepathic waitress with an otherworldly quality.[1][2]The show is broadcast on the premium cable network HBO in the United States. It is produced by HBO in association with Ball's production company, Your Face Goes Here Entertainment.[1] It premiered on September 7, 2008. The series has received critical acclaim and won several awards, including a Golden Globe and an Emmy. Season 2 premiered on June 14, 2009; and Season 3 on June 13, 2010. On June 21, 2010, HBO renewed True Blood for a fourth season, which aired June 26, 2011.[3] The fifth season of True Blood started airing on June 10, 2012.[4] On July 2, 2012, HBO announced that True Blood had been renewed for a sixth season that will premiere in June 2013.[5]The fictional universe depicted in the series is premised on the notion that vampires (and other supernatural creatures) are living among us, unbeknownst to the majority of humans until two years ago, when the creation of synthetic blood (aka 'Tru Blood') by Japanese scientists allowed vampires to come out of the coffin (a term coined as a play on "coming out of the closet") and reveal their existence to the world on the basis that they no longer need to feed on humans to survive.E-1 This so-called 'Great Revelation' has split the vampires of the world into two camps: those who wish to integrate into human society (aka 'mainstream') by campaigning for citizenship and equal rights,E-1 and those who think that human-vampire co-existence is impossible because it is in conflict with the inherently violent nature of vampires. Throughout the series, other supernatural creatures are also introduced, among them shapeshifters, werewolves, fairies, witches and a maenad.The series revolves around Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepathic Human-Fairy hybrid known as a halfling (although not to be confused with similarly named, but unrelated creatures found in other fantasy works), who is a waitress at Merlotte's in the small Louisiana town of Bon Temps, owned by Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell), who is a shapeshifter, though this secret is kept hidden from most of the town. Other characters include Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a handsome 173-year-old vampire who has returned to Bon Temps to take up residence in his former home following the death of his last remaining relative; Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley), Sookie's tough-talking but insecure best friend; Sookie's womanizing brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten); thousand-year-old vampire and Sheriff of Area 5, Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgrd); and Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis), a short order cook, drug dealer, road crew member and medium.The show explores several contemporary issues, such as the struggle for equal rights, discrimination and violence against minorities and homosexuals, the problems of drug addiction, the power of faith and religion, the control/influence of the media, the quest for identity, and the importance of family.Series creator Alan Ball had previously worked with the cable channel HBO on Six Feet Under, which ran for five seasons. In October 2005 after Six Feet Under's series finished, Ball signed a two-year agreement with HBO to develop and produce original programming for the network. True Blood became the first project under the deal, after Ball became acquainted with Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire Mystery books.[6] One day, while early for a dental appointment, Ball was browsing through a Barnes & Noble bookshop and came across Dead Until Dark, the first installment in Harris's series. He read the entries that followed and became interested in "bringing [Harris's] vision to television".[6][7] However, Harris already had two other adaptation options for the books. She said she chose to work with him, though, because "[Ball] really 'got' me. That's how he convinced me to go with him. I just felt that he understood what I was doing with the books."The project's hour-long pilot was ordered concurrently with the finalization of the aforementioned development deal and was written, directed and produced by Ball.[1][6] Cast members Paquin, Kwanten and Trammell were announced in February 2007 and Moyer later on in April.[8][9] The pilot was shot in the early summer of 2007 and was officially ordered to series in August, at which point Ball had already written several more episodes.[1] Production on the series began later that fall,[10] with Brook Kerr, who portrayed Tara Thornton in the original pilot, being replaced by Rutina Wesley.[11] Two more episodes of the series had been filmed before the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike shut down production of the 12-episode first season until 2008.[12] That September, after only the first two episodes of the series had aired, HBO placed an order for a second season of twelve episodes of the show, with production scheduled to commence in January 2009 for a summer premiere.[13]True Blood's Emmy-nominated title sequence is composed of portrayals of the show's Deep South setting, and runs to "Bad Things" by Jace Everett, although the original featurette was created around the Jennifer Herrema (Royal Trux) song "RadTimesXpress".[14]Conceptually, the sequence was constructed around the idea of "the whore in the house of prayer"[15] by intermingling contradictory images of sex, violence and religion and displaying them from the point of view of "a supernatural, predatory creature observing human beings from the shadows ..."[14] Ideas of redemption and forgiveness are also explored, and thus the sequence to progresses from morning to night and culminates in a baptism.[15]The title sequence also features images and themes of death and rebirth; the circle of life. A Venus fly-trap can be seen engulfing a frog while a rotting foxs head is sped up to reveal maggots feeding off of the corpse. Rebirth is also recognized through an image of a woman being washed clean from her sins in a lake as well as a Reverend blessing and possibly performing an exorcism on a member of his congregation.[16]Most of the footage used in the sequence was filmed on location. Crew members took a four-day trip to Louisiana to film and also shot at a Chicago church and on a stage and in a bar in Seattle.[15]In editing the opening, individual frames were also splattered with drops of blood.[15] The sequence's transitions were constructed differently, though; they were made with a Polaroid transfer technique. The last frame of one shot and the first frame of another were taken as a single Polaroid photo, which was then divided between emulsion and backing. The emulsion was then filmed being further separated by chemicals and those shots of this separation were placed back into the final edit.[14]Eight different typefaces, inspired by Southern road signage, were also created manually for cast and crew credits, as well as the show's title card.[15]In a 2010 issue of TV Guide, the show's opening title sequence ranked #5 on a list of TV's top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.[17]Gary Calamar, who supervises the series' music, said that his goal for the show's soundtrack is to create something "swampy, bluesy and spooky" and to feature local Louisiana musicians.[18] True Blood soundtrack albums have twice earned Grammy Award nominations.Composer Nathan Barr writes the original score for the series which features cello, guitar, prepared piano and glass harmonica among other instruments, all of which he performs himself.[19] The main theme song is "Bad Things" by country music artist Jace Everett, from his 2005 self-titled debut.[20]Elektra/Atlantic Records released a True Blood soundtrack on May 19, 2009, the same day as the release of the DVD and Blu-ray of the first season.[21] Nathan Barr's original score for True Blood was released on CD on the Varse Sarabande label on September 8, 2009.[22] The second True Blood soundtrack was released on May 25, 2010, to coincide with the third season's premiere in June. The third volume was released on September 6, 2011, a few days before the season four finale.[23]Both Nathan Barr and Jace Everett won 2009 awards from Broadcast Music Incorporated in the BMI Cable Awards category for, respectively, True Blood's original score and theme song.[24]The show's individual episode titles are named after songs featured in the episodes, usually heard during the closing credits. The title usually indicates something about the events that will unfold throughout the given episode. For example, episode ten of season four is titled "Burning Down the House" and the end credits feature a cover version of the classic Talking Heads song performed by The Used.The premiere of True Blood was prefaced with a viral marketing/alternate reality game (ARG) campaign, based at BloodCopy.com. This included setting up multiple websites,[25][26][27] encoding web address into unmarked envelopes mailed to high profile blog writers and others, and even performances by a "vampire" who attempted to reach out to others of their kind, to discuss the recent creation of "TrueBlood", a fictional beverage which is featured in the show. A MySpace account with the username "Blood"[28] had, as of June 19, uploaded two videos;[29] one entitled "Vampire Taste Test  True Blood vs Human",[30] and one called "BloodCopy Exclusive INTERVIEW WITH SAMSON THE VAMPIRE".A prequel comic was handed out to attendees of the 2008 Comic-Con. The comic centers around an old vampire named Lamar, who tells the reader about how TruBlood surfaced and was discussed between many vampires before going public. At one point, Lamar wonders if TruBlood is making the world safe for vampires or from them. Several commercials featured on HBO and Facebook[31] aired prior to the series premiere, placing vampires in ads similar to those of beer and wine. Some beverage vending machines across the US were also fitted with cards indicating that they were "sold out" of TruBlood.HBO produced and broadcast two documentaries to promote True Blood, entitled "True Bloodlines".[32] The first, Vampire Legends, explored the earliest portrayals of vampires in legend, literature and cinema. The second, A New Type, discusses vampire culture from Nosferatu to today's sensual, sexual creatures. To that end, the show also covered the modern vampire subculture and real-life vampire clubs.[33] Actors and writers from True Blood appeared in the documentaries. The shows first aired on September 6, 2008, on HBO.Thousands of DVDs of the first episode were handed out to attendees of Midnight Madness, a special film festival. Blockbuster Video provided free rental of the first episode of True Blood several days before it was broadcast on HBO. The video had a faint promotional watermark throughout the episode.On April 16, 2009, HBO released the first teaser poster for Season 2. The image uses a perspective technique that shows observers one of two images.[34] A minute-long promotional video advertising season two, which featured Bob Dylan's "Beyond Here Lies Nothin'", was released via Entertainment Tonight in early May.[35]On September 19, 2009, HBO.com began selling Tru:Blood,[36] a beverage branded to resemble the fictional synthetic blood that appears in the show. The beverage is a carbonated blood orange-flavored drink, developed and manufactured by Omni Consumer Products, a company that specializes in defictionalizing brands from television and movies, and FMCG Manufacturing Company, a specialist manufacturer of licensed entertainment products.There is also a website for The Fellowship of the Sun,[37] antagonists from the book series, featuring videos about hot-button issues such as becoming a vampire.FX, available in the UK, launched an extensive promotional website for the series.[38]On September 15, 2009, HBO filed a trademark registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a possible future electronic game based on True Blood.[39]On September 18, 2009, HBO launched a True Blood jewelry line in collaboration with New York-based designer Udi Behr. Inspired by the series, the jewelry has a Gothic look and features sterling silver, polished steel, and rubies.[40]On June 1, 2010, HBO held a special event at a number of movie theaters around the U.S.,[41] complete with red carpet, searchlights and swag bags. Contest winners were invited to watch a special live, the Season 2 finale, a preview of Season 3, and a live interview on the set of True Blood with the cast and Alan Ball.HBO began selling True Blood figural busts featuring Bill, Sookie, and Eric in summer 2010. Busts of other characters will also be available later.HBO and IDW Publishing announced at the 2010 WonderCon that they would be publishing a comic book based on the series.[42] Alan Ball developed and wrote the comic. The first booklet, with a print run of 53,000, was released in July 2010 [43] and soon sold out. The second issue went on sale August 18, 2010, with a second printing of the first issue going on sale August 25.[44]There were a total of 6 comics issued in the series, which were published collectively as the Graphic Novel All Together Now on February 15, 2011. This was the first in a series of four graphic novels released by HBO under the True Blood franchise and sold in major bookstores.[45] The following titles include Tainted Love, The French Quarter" and "Ongoing".True Blood employs a broad ensemble cast composed of regular, central characters and a rotating group of impermanent supporting characters. Though the series is based in the fictional town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, a noticeable number of the actors comprising the cast are originally from outside the United States. In an interview, Ball explained that he didn't intentionally seek out "non-American" actors, but was willing to go anywhere he needed to in order "to find the actor who makes the character breathe". Ball went on to explain that, in casting, there was more of a focus on who would portray the character in a compelling way rather than who would physically resemble the characters from the book. Noting that there's a definite difference between the characters and storylines portrayed in True Blood and the ones depicted in The Southern Vampire Mysteries, he described Harris as being very understanding in terms of how her work was being reinterpreted.[46]The major characters of the first season of True Blood are introduced among various intertwining plot lines that surround the Bon Temps bar "Merlotte's". The show's main protagonist, Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), is a telepath and waitress at Merlotte's.E-1 In the opening episode she saves Merlotte's first vampire customer, Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), when a local couple attempts to drain him of his blood (vampire blood is known on the show as a human narcotic: "V" or "V Juice").E-1 Through the relationship that develops between Sookie and Bill, the viewer progressively learns more about vampire culture and the limitations of vampire physiology (e.g. susceptibility to silver and the sun).The major plot of the first season revolves around the murder of several women connected to Sookie's older brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten).E-1 The women murdered include sexual partner Maudette Pickens (Danielle Sapia),E-1 on-and-off romantic interest and Merlotte's waitress Dawn Green (Lynn Collins),E-3 grandmother Adele (Lois Smith) or simply "Gran",E-5 and girlfriend Amy Burley (Lizzy Caplan).E-11 Though the viewer is always aware of Jason's innocence in their deaths, Detective Andy Bellefleur (Chris Bauer) targets him as the prime suspect in the investigation he conducts with Sheriff Bud Dearborne (William Sanderson) to identify their killer.E-1 Jason's best friends and co-workers, Hoyt Fortenberry (Jim Parrack) and Rene Lenier (Michael Raymond-James) provide him with support despite the turmoil he encounters.E-1 Rene, who becomes engaged to Merlotte's waitress Arlene Fowler (Carrie Preston),E-8 is eventually exposed as the Bon Temps murderer and is killed in a final confrontation with Sookie.E-12A secondary plot in the first season (that later develops as the primary storyline in the second) revolves around Sookie's best friend Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley).E-1 In the first episode, Tara is hired as a bartender at Merlotte's by bar owner, shapeshifter,E-11 and admirer of Sookie, Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell),E-1 with whom Tara later has a brief relationship.E-3 Tara's cousin Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis) already works as a cook at Merlotte'sE-1 (in addition to several other jobs that include road crew, prostitute, and drug dealer)E-3 with Andy's cousin and Iraq War veteran, Terry (Todd Lowe).E-2 Tara's story is characterized by her relationship with her alcoholic and abusive mother Lettie Mae (Adina Porter)E-2 and her own inner "demons".E-10 During the season, Lettie Mae achieves sobrietyE-8 but Tara's life begins to spin out of control. Kicked out of her home and totaling her car in a drunk driving accident,E-10 she's taken in by "social worker" Maryann Forrester (Michelle Forbes).E-11 While staying with Maryann, Tara is introduced to "Eggs" Benedict Talley (Mehcad Brooks), to whom she becomes attracted.E-11The final major plotline of the first season revolves around the elements of vampire society that Sookie and Bill's relationship introduce. While trying to prove her brother's innocence in relation to Maudette and Dawn's murders, Bill takes Sookie to the vampire bar "Fangtasia" to investigate. There, Sookie is introduced to Fangtasia's owner and the vampire sheriff of "Area 5" in Louisiana: Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgrd).E-4 Eric is immediately interested in Sookie and her strange abilities, but his progeny and assistant Pam (Kristin Bauer) is less impressed.E-4 Eric employs Sookie to find a thief in his bar, but the perpetrator (a vampire) attempts to kill Sookie when she reveals his identity. Bill stakes and kills the thief to save her, but has committed a serious crime in killing another vampire.E-8 When Bill is tried for his crime, his punishment is to transform seventeen-year-old Jessica Hamby (Deborah Ann Woll) into a vampire to replace the one he destroyed.E-10A secondary plotline introduced in the first season (which later becomes a main plotline in Season 2) is that although many humans are attracted to vampires (referred to as "fang bangers") and flock to establishments like Fangtasia, not all people are accepting of the idea that vampires should be given rights equal to those afforded the mortals of the True Blood universe. During the first season, one of the ways in which anti-vampire sentiment is expressed is through regular televised appearances by the "Fellowship of the Sun",E-2 a Dallas-based church that in Season 2 becomes headed by the Reverend Steve Newlin (Michael McMillian)E-3 after his father and family are killed in a strange "accident".E-2During the second season of True Blood, the influence of Maryann Forrester and the conflict between vampires and humans is expanded. Most of the cast from the first season returns and several new main characters are introduced. The same style of interconnected story telling used in the first season is repeated, with the foremost plot focusing on Maryann Forrester being revealed as a maenadE-19 with the power to influence humans.E-15 She begins by manipulating Tara and Eggs to achieve her goal of summoning her god to earth,E-20 and eventually takes control of almost the entire population of Bon Temps.E-22While Maryann begins establishing her hold on Bon Temps, Sookie is recruited by EricE-15 to investigate the disappearance of his 2000-year-old maker and the Sheriff of Area 9 in Texas: Godric (Allan Hyde).E-17 While Sookie is absent from Bon Temps, Sam hires Daphne Landry (Ashley Jones) to join Merlotte's staff.E-13 Daphne (who is revealed to also be a shapeshifterE-17) begins a romance with Sam,E-16 but is later exposed as working for Maryann.E-18 Jason also leaves Bon Temps for Dallas to join the Fellowship of the Sun,E-14 which Reverend Newlin has steered in a new militant direction despite the protestations of his wife Sarah (Anna Camp).E-13 Godric is discovered in the custody of the Fellowship,E-17 and one of Godric's lieutenants, Isabel Beaumont (Valerie Cruz),E-17 sends her human boyfriend Hugo (Christopher Gartin)E-18 to assist Sookie in infiltrating the church. Though Eric's primary interest in Dallas is finding Godric, he also attempts to place himself between Sookie and Bill. To accomplish this, he enlists the aid of Bill's maker Lorena (Mariana Klaveno);E-17, who thus becomes a more prominent contribution to the cast after a brief introduction in the first season.E-5 In the penultimate episode of the second season, once the conflict in Texas is concluded, the vampire queen of Louisiana Sophie-Anne Leclerq (Evan Rachel Wood) is introduced.E-23 Both Bill and Eric visit her in an attempt to find out how to defeat Maryann.E-23. Bill uses the information provided by Sophie-Anne to devise a plan involving Sam and Sookie, and the three manage to kill Maryann in the season two finale. Subsequently, Bill takes Sookie out to an exclusive French restaurant to propose to her; but before she can give her answer, Bill is kidnapped.Season three picks up straight after the events of season two with Sookie on the hunt to track down Bill and his kidnappers. She turns to Eric for help, who is not interested (seeing this turn of events as a chance to get Sookie for himself), but he ends up sending werewolf Alcide Herveaux (Joe Manganiello) for assistance after it is revealed that Bill was taken by V-addicted werewolves in the employ of the 3000-year-old vampire king of Mississippi, Russell Edgington (Denis O'Hare). Meanwhile, back in Bon Temps, Lafayette embarks on a relationship with his mother's care nurse and brujo Jess Velasquez (Kevin Alejandro) and learns about his own special powers as a medium, while Sam hires a new waitress at Merlotte's, Wiccan Holly Cleary (Lauren Bowles).Deadline reported that in season 4, Jessica Tuck (Nan Flanagan) and Janina Gavankar (Luna) will become season regulars. Alex Breckenridge (Kate) and Vedette Lim (Naomi) will be recurring actresses.[47]Joining the cast for season five will be Christopher Meloni, who previously starred on another of HBO's own original series Oz as well as Law & Order: Special Victims Unit for 12 years. Details on his character have yet to be released.[48] Also joining the cast is Scott Foley as Patrick, Terry's old war buddy,[49] Louis Herthum as JD, Kelly Overton as Rikki, a new werewolf curious how Marcus died,[50] Carolyn Hennesy is expected to be Rosalyn Harris, a Texas vampire with twang,[51] and Jacob Hopkins will play child vampire Chancellor Alexander Drew.[52]The main mystery of the first season concerns the murders of women connected to Sookie's brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten). Maudette Pickens and Dawn Green are both strangled shortly after having been alone with Jason. Though Detective Bellefleur has little doubt that Jason is the killer, the town sheriff does not suspect him. Sookie's grandmother is murdered shortly afterward. At the end of the season it is revealed that Arlene Fowler's fianc, Rene Lenier, is actually a man named Drew Marshall who has created a false identity, complete with Cajun accent. He has been killing women he considers "fang-bangers."The first season also focuses on Sookie's relationship with Bill and Sam's relationship with Sookie's friend Tara. Bill explains the rules of being a vampire to Sookie and, after killing a vampire to defend her, is forced to "turn" a young girl named Jessica into a vampire as punishment. In the last episode of the season, Jessica is left under Bill's care. After Maudette and Dawn's murders, Jason becomes addicted to vampire blood and has a short relationship with another addict, Amy Burley, which ends when she is murdered by Marshall. The season ends with the discovery of a body in Detective Andy Bellefleur's car in Merlotte's parking lot.Season two focuses on two main plots  in the first, the disappearance of the 2,000-year-old vampire Sheriff of Area 9, Godric, causes Eric to enlist Sookie and Bill's aid in finding the ancient vampire in Dallas. Their paths cross Jason's as he seeks to discover meaning in his life with the Fellowship of the Sun, a church dedicated to anti-vampire activities.The second plot line concerns a maenad named Maryann who visits Bon Temps after Tara attracts her attention at the end of the first season. Maryann is a figure from Sam's past and knows his true identity as a shapeshifter. Her influence on the town and its residents results in mayhem that grows more destructive as the season progresses. At the end of the season, Bill proposes to Sookie, but is kidnapped by unknown assailants when Sookie retreats to the bathroom to consider his proposal.The second season loosely follows the plot of the second novel of The Southern Vampire Mysteries, Living Dead in Dallas. In addition, the character of Sophie-Anne Leclerq, initially introduced in the sixth novel Definitely Dead, was introduced as a major supporting character.On July 30, 2009, HBO confirmed that True Blood would be renewed for a third season,[53] which began shooting on December 3, 2009.[54] It premiered on June 13, 2010, simultaneously on HBO and HBO Canada, and contained 12 episodes.Season three loosely follows the plot of the third novel of The Southern Vampire Mysteries, Club Dead, and introduces werewolves to the show's mythology. It also introduces the characters of Russell Edgington, the Vampire King of Mississippi, and his private investigator, Franklin Mott. In addition, some characters from the fourth novel Dead to the World are introduced: Crystal Norris as Jason's love interest, her family of werepanthers from Hotshot, and Sookie's fairy godmother, Claudine. Sookie's heritage as part faerie is also revealed later in the season, a major plot element from the eighth and ninth novels From Dead to Worse and Dead and Gone. This season ends with Jason left to take care of Hotshot, Tara leaving Bon Temps Bill fighting the queen, Sam shooting Tommy, and Hoyt and Jessica, moving in together. the final cliffhanger is Claudine taking Sookie to Faerie.The fourth season of True Blood contains 12 episodes. The first, titled "She's Not There", aired Sunday, June 26, 2011 in the US on HBO; the season finale aired Sunday, September 11, 2011.[55] It is loosely based on the fourth novel in The Southern Vampire Mysteries series, Dead to the World.[56]A coven of witches, led by Marnie, poses a threat to vampires when they discover the witches are working on necromancy. Sookie returns to Bon Temps after a year (even though she was away for only a few minutes in Fairie Land) to find Bill as the new King of Louisiana and that her brother and friends had given up on her. As the series progresses, a powerful necromancer from the 16th century, Antonia, possesses the body of Marnie in order to exact revenge on all vampires. Sookie starts a romance with Eric who has amnesia due to a spell cast by Antonia / Marnie. The witch Antonia eventually realizes the wrongdoing she's caused to innocent people and decides to stop. Yet Marnie, addicted to Antonia's power, binds her against her will to acquire her powers. Subplots include Lafayette's introduction to the world of magic and his abilities as a medium, Sam's family troubles, Alcide and Debbie's troubled relationship, and Jason, Hoyt and Jessica's love triangle. The finale is a series of cliffhangers, including a warning from the ghost of Rene that Terry will cause Arlene trouble, the escape of Russell Edgington, the reappearance of Steve Newlin as a vampire, and the shooting of Tara.On August 11, 2011, HBO announced that True Blood would be renewed for a fifth season of 12 episodes, to premiere in summer of 2012, with a confirmed date of June 10 at 9pm. [57] Alan Ball signed a multi-year contract with HBO in July 2011, but only agreed to produce the show for the fifth season. After the season five finale, he'll leave his position as showrunner.[58] [59][60]The season follows Bill and Eric being captured by the Vampire Authority after the disappearance of Nan Flanagan. The two are almost sentenced to death by the Guardian, Roman, before revealing that Russell Edgington is alive and free after being released by a mysterious vampire. With the help of Sookie and Alcide, the team discovers his hiding place and brings him in. Season 5 also focuses on Terry, who learns he is cursed after committing a terrible crime during the war in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Sookie learns that her powers are limited and contemplates having a normal life. Jason discovers his parents were murdered by a vampire and vows to find out who is responsible. Lafayette tries to deal with the powers given to him by Jesus. Russell, along with Eric's vampire sister Nora and Salome, redefine the values of the Authority and view humans as nothing more than food: just as Lilith of the Vampire bible wanted. The season ends with Bill drinking the blood of Lilith in front of Sookie and Eric. He begins to fall apart, ultimately meeting the "true death". Shortly after, a nude Bill "rises from the blood", as an even more powerful vampire reincarnation of Lilith ("Billith"). Surprised, Eric yells for Sookie to run prior to the end credits playing.Critical reception of True Blood has generally been favorable, despite the fact that initial impressions were mixed. The New York Post critic wrote of the opening episodes: "If HBO's new vampire show is any indication, there would still be countless deaths  especially among vampire hunters and the viewers who love them  because everyone would be dying of boredom. And so it is with HBO's new series from death-obsessed Alan Ball, creator of the legendary Six Feet Under, whose new show True Blood, won't so much make your blood run cold as it will leave you cold."[61]Whereas USA Today concluded: "Sexy, witty and unabashedly peculiar, True Blood is a blood-drenched Southern Gothic romantic parable set in a world where vampires are out and about and campaigning for equal rights. Part mystery, part fantasy, part comedy, and all wildly imaginative exaggeration, [True] Blood proves that there's still vibrant life  or death  left in the 'star-crossed cute lovers' paradigm. You just have to know where to stake your romantic claim."[62]By the end of the first season, True Blood had a score of 64, indicating generally favorable reviews, on Metacritic, an aggregator of critical responses.[63] The second season received a more favorable score of 74 on Metacritic.[64] The third season's rating on Metacritic has risen to 79, while the fourth season has a rating of 74.[65][66] The fifth season has a rating of 73.[67]True Blood was the subject of a 2010 Sesame Street sketch entitled "True Mud". The parody features puppet versions of Sookie, Bill, Lafayette, Sam, Tara and Sheriff Dearborn. In the skit, Muppet Sookie struggles to fulfill Muppet Bill's pleas for a pint of "True Mud", as the other characters speculate if he is a "grouch".[68]In August 2010, Anna Paquin (Sookie), Stephen Moyer (Bill), and Alexander Skarsgrd (Eric) appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone covered in blood and completely naked. This cover drew criticism [69] due to the image's supposed promotion of sexuality and violence. The shows creator, Alan Ball, stated in the magazine, To me, vampires are sex... I don't get a vampire story about abstinence. I'm 53. I don't care about high school students. I find them irritating and uninformed." [69]The struggle for vampire equality in True Blood has been interpreted as an allegory for the LGBT rights movement.[70] Charlaine Harris, the author of the book series on which the show is based, stated that her initial characterization for the vampires were as "...a minority that was trying to get equal rights".[71][72] Several phrases in the series are borrowed and adapted from expressions used against and about LGBT people, such as "God Hates Fangs" (God Hates Fags) and "Coming out of the coffin" (coming out of the closet).[72]Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker wrote that the show is built "around a series of metaphors: Vampire rights stand in for gay rights, and now the clever laughs elicited from this bratty-vampire girl represent an extreme of adolescent rebelliousness".[70] David Bianculli of NPR wrote, " True Blood is big on allegory, and the tension about accepting vampires into society is an obvious play on civil rights in general, and gay rights in particular".[72] However, the series' creator, Alan Ball (who is homosexual) has stated that such a comparison is lazy and possibly homophobic and Lauren Gutterman of the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies has expressed concerns that the show might perpetuate negative stereotypes of homosexuals as deviants.[71]The first episode of True Blood debuted at a very modest 1.44 million viewers compared to the network's past drama premiers such as Big Love which premiered at 4.56 million, and John from Cincinnati which debuted at 3.4 million.[73] However, by late November 2008, 6.8 million a week were watching: this figure included repeat and on-demand viewings.[74] The season finale's viewership was 2.4 million.The second season premiere of the series (June 14, 2009) was viewed by 3.7 million, making it the most watched program on HBO since the series finale of The Sopranos. The total number of viewers for the season premiere, including the late night replay, was 5.1 million.[75] The tenth episode of the second season (August 23, 2009) was seen by 5.3 million viewers, a new record for the series.[76] The second season's finale (September 13, 2009) was seen by 5.1 million viewers. An average of 12.4 million a week watched the second season.[77]The ninth episode of the fourth season (August 21, 2011) set a new record with 5.53 million viewers, making it the most viewed episode to date.[78]True Blood is HBO's most watched series since The Sopranos.[79] The show was declared the eighth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002-2012).[80]The True Blood DVDs have been consistent bestsellers in the US. By the end of 2009, the first season DVD had sold over 1.6 million units and taken in over $57 million. It was the only TV show in the 50 Top-Selling DVDs of 2009.[88] The second season DVD sold a total of 1,159,509 units in 2010, earning over $41 million.[89] The third season DVD was the 61st bestselling DVD of 2011, selling almost 1 million copies and earning over $30 million. It was the best selling TV boxset of 2011.[90] In its first week of release - the week ending June 2, 2012 - season four debuted at number one on the UKs "TV on Video" chart.[91] However, it reached only number six in the combined DVD chart.[92] In its first week of release in North America, it sold over 660,000 units, earning nearly $20 million.[93] In its second week of release in North America, it sold a further 120,000 units (making a combined total of 784,000 units sold), earning another $4 million.[94]The following table lists the countries in which True Blood airs outside the USA.True Blood at TV.com1 Series overview2 Production

Bonus DVD - 80 minute Paley Center Panel with Alan Bell and cast

Bonus DVD - 80 minute Paley Center Panel with Alan Bell and castBonus DVD - 80 minute Paley Center Panel with Alan Bell and castVampire filmVampire literatureOfficial websiteTrue Blood at the Internet Movie DatabaseThe template Tv.com is being considered for deletion.True Blood site at WikiaBig Brother is a reality game show franchise created by John de Mol. The premise of the show is that a group of people live together in a large house, isolated from the outside world. They are continuously watched by television cameras. Each series lasts for around three months, with 1216 contestants entering the house. In order to win the final cash prize, all the contestants have to do is survive periodic evictions and be the last one standing.The idea for Big Brother is said to have come during a brainstorm session at the Dutch-based international television production firm Endemol, on March 10, 1997. The first-ever version of Big Brother was broadcast in 1999 on Veronica in the Netherlands. Since then the format has become a worldwide TV franchise, airing in many countries in varying adaptations.Although each country has made its own adaptations and changes to the format, the contestants are confined to a specially designed house where their every action is recorded by cameras and microphones at all times and they are not permitted to make any contact with the outside world.In all the countries that have produced Big Brother, they have referred to the contestants as "housemates"; however in the American version of the format they are referred to as "houseguests". The term Big Brother originates from George Orwell's novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four.Besides living together under continuous observation, which is the major attraction of the contest, the program relies on four basic props: The stripped-bare, back-to-basics environment in which they live, the evictions, the weekly tasks and competitions set by Big Brother and the "Diary/Confession Room", in which the housemates individually convey their thoughts, feelings, and frustrations and reveal their nominees for eviction.Contestants are required to evict one of their own on a regular basis; in the earlier series of Big Brother, contestants were evicted every two weeks, however, as introduced in the UK version, evictions occurred once a week; all of the current series of Big Brother follow this format.At regular intervals, the housemates each privately nominate a number of fellow housemates that they wish to see evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nominations are then announced and viewers are given the opportunity to vote via telephone for whom they wish to see evicted. The only known exception to this process is the American version, in which the housemates themselves vote to evict each other. After the votes are tallied, the "evictee" leaves the house and is interviewed live by the host of the show, usually in front of a studio audience.In some cases, two housemates may be evicted simultaneously (a "double eviction"), or rarely, no housemates will be removed for that week. At the end of the game, the last remaining housemate is declared the winner of that particular series and receives prizes, often including a large amount of money, a car, a vacation and (in some editions) a house.In the first season of most series of Big Brother, the house that the housemates had to live in was very basic. Although essential amenities, such as running water, furniture and a limited ration of food were provided, luxury items were often forbidden. This added a survivalist element to the show, increasing the potential for social tension within the house. Nowadays, almost all series provide a modern house for the contest, with a jacuzzi, sauna, VIP suite, loft and other luxuries.The contestants are required to do housework and are set tasks by the producers of the show, who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as "Big Brother". The tasks are designed to test their teamwork abilities and community spirit, and in some countries the housemates' shopping budget or weekly allowance often depends on the outcome of any given tasks. The housemates have a weekly allowance with which they can buy food and other essentials.Most international versions of the show remain quite similar to each other in that their main format remains true to the original fly on the wall, observational style, with the emphasis being on human relationships. This is taken to the extent that contestants are forbidden from discussing nominations or voting strategy altogether. The US version, however, has since 2001 taken on a significantly different format from the others in their second season; with a far stronger emphasis on strategy, competition and voting where the public does not choose who to evict. In 2011, the UK version controversially adapted the discussion of nominations, before changing this rule back following a poll by Big Brother broadcaster Channel 5, which revealed that 90% of voters believed that housemates should not discuss nominations.From a sociological and demographic perspective, the Big Brother franchise allows the opportunity for analysis of how people react when forced into close confinement with people who lie outside their comfort zone, since they may hold different opinions or ideals from other contestants, or simply belong to a different group of people than a contestant normally interacts with. Indeed, the format is ideally suited to such analysis because the viewer is afforded the opportunity to see how a person reacts on the outside through the constant recording of their actions and also what they feel on the inside through the Diary Room/Confession Room. The results can range from violent or angry confrontations to genuine and tender connections (often including romantic interludes), providing entertainment to the public.The show is notable for involving the Internet. Although the show typically broadcasts daily updates in the evening (which are sometimes criticized for their heavy editing), viewers can also watch a continuous, 24-hour feed from multiple cameras on the web. These websites were highly successful, even after some national series started charging for access to the video stream. In some countries, Internet broadcasting was supplemented by updates via email, WAP and SMS. The House is even shown live on satellite television, although in some countries, with a 10-15 minute delay to allow libelous or unacceptable content (such as references to people who are not taking part in the program and have therefore not consented to have personal information about them broadcast) to be removed.The Big Brother contestants are isolated within the house. They have no access to television, radio or the internet and are not allowed routine communication with the outside world. This was the main moral for most of the earlier series of Big Brother. In the more recent series of the franchise, special instances have occurred whereby contestants are allowed to view televised events which are usually as a reward for winning a task. In most versions of the program, books and writing materials are also forbidden. Sometimes in series with this rule an exception is made for religious materials such as the Bible, Torah or Qur'an. Some versions ban all writing implements, extending to any item that can be used to write such as lipstick or eyeliner. Despite the fact that the housemates are generally isolated, on some occasions some contestants are allowed to exit the house as part of tasks. Contestants are sometimes permitted to exit the house in case of emergencies.Contestants have regularly scheduled interactions with the show's host on eviction nights. Throughout each day the program's producer, via the "Big Brother" voice, issues directives and commands to contestants. Some versions of the show allow private counseling sessions with a psychologist. These are allowed at any time, often conducted by telephone from the Diary Room.The Big Brother format has been adapted in some countries in that the housemates are locally known celebrities (The celebrity status of the housemate can be either widespread or rather limited,) These shows are called Celebrity Big Brother or Big Brother VIP, depending on where the series is. In some countries, the prize money normally awarded to the winning housemate is donated to a charity, and all celebrities are paid to appear in the show as long as they do not voluntarily leave before their eviction or the end of the series. The rest of the format rules are almost the same as the ones from the original version, although in many instances they are not so strict because of the exceptional nature of the program. The celebrity version has become particularly popular in the United Kingdom where the Tenth Series will aired in the summer of 2012, and an Eleventh Series will air in January 2013.The Big Brother format has been extensively modified in some countries, most often to the point where the housemates are either teenagers or housemates from previous seasons. The winners of these seasons are often eligible to win the prize for themselves, unlike most of the celebrity edition versions.There are also "test runs" with a group of celebrities or journalists living together in the house during a few days, with the only goal being testing out the house. There are occasions where people who have auditioned for the show are also put in the house, most notably in the British edition, where many housemates claim to have met before. Series such as these are known to occur in Argentina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Pacific, Philippines, Spain and many other countries. In some cases, it is not broadcast, but in others, such as the U.S. edition, it is used as a promotional tool.There are currently 287 winners of the Big Brother format. The most recent winner is Diana Hernndez from Colombia.Season 1, 2003:  Cherise Makubale

All these follow the normal Big Brother rules with the exception that contestants must come from each of the different countries in the region where it airs:

Africa: Angola, Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Arabia: Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Syria and Tunisia.
Pacific: Chile, Ecuador and Peru

The format was used in Australia in the form of Friday Night Live from Series 5 until Series 8.The fifth UK edition introduced the "Evil" touch, whereby the authority character "Big Brother" became almost a villain. Big Brother was establishing punishments and was proposing hard tasks and secret tricks. This was also seen in Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Pacific, Scandinavia, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, Philippines and Mexico.The sixth UK series introduced secret missions where housemates would be able to win luxuries if they completed a secret task set by "Big Brother".The eighth UK series saw an all-female house. However, two days later, one male housemate entered. The same twist was used in Big Brother 4 Bulgaria. Big Brother Africa 4 used the same twist using an all-male launch show instead of females.Since Big Brother 2, the UK series always opens with a twist which have included the public being able to choose the final housemate out of three possibilities (Big Brother 2), the public voting for a housemate to leave during the first week and then the housemates choosing between the two housemates with the least number of votes (Big Brother 3), First Night Nominations (Big Brother 4), Suitcase Nominations (Big Brother 5), Unlucky Housemate 13 (Big Brother 6), Big Brother Hood (Big Brother 7), an all-female House and the first inclusion of twins as contestants (Big Brother 8), the first couple to enter as housemates and set a secret task to hide their real relationship (Big Brother 9), all "housemates" really being "non-housemates" who had to earn their housemate status (Big Brother 10), a mole entering the House with an "Impossible Task" (Big Brother 11), Jackie Stallone entering a house containing her son's ex-wife (Celebrity Big Brother 3), the entrance of a non-celebrity in a celebrity edition (Celebrity Big Brother 4) and Jade Goody's family announced to be visiting. (Celebrity Big Brother 5). During Celebrity Big Brother 6, LaToya Jackson was first to enter and walked straight into the bedrooms - which are usually locked until everyone has arrived - and entered a private bedroom. She put her bag on the bed to claim it as her own; it was assumed this was pre-arranged.[1] Terry Christian became Head of House - which had been used in the latter weeks of the previous non-celebrity series - and had to choose three housemates to face the first eviction, which the others later voted to save one of the nominees, Ben Adams, leaving Lucy Pinder and eventual winner Ulrika Jonsson to face the first eviction. In the summer series of 2009 the house at first was empty with only crates to sit on and none of the new arrivals were given housemate status, and had to earn it by doing tasks, some of which were minor sacrifices, the most notable were Noirin Kelly shaving off her hair and drawing a mustache and glasses on her face, which she had to do for almost three weeks until she won a chance to stop doing it, Freddie Fisher and eventual winner Sophie Reade changed their names by deedpoll to Halfwit and Dogface respectively, they were addressed by these names by Big Brother for nine weeks - although their fellow housemates could refer to them by their original names except during nominations - they were given a present by Big Brother in Week 10 to have their original names back. On Day 4 the six people who had not received housemate status were put up for a public vote, the person with the least votes - which turned out to be Beinazir Lasharie - had to leave immediately, the house was then transformed into looking like a Big Brother house. Other countries such as Bulgaria and the United States (and previously Australia) have now started using these opening night twists.The fifth UK edition introduced "Fake evictions" where one or two housemates are "evicted"; however, unbeknownst to the housemates, they have in fact not been evicted. The housemate/s usually are put into a secret house where numerous twists happen. In the eighth UK Series one housemate was evicted, interviewed, and then sent straight back into the house. The housemates in the house got to see everything live, though.In France and Canada, the format has been developed using couples. 12 single people stay in the same house until only the winning couple is left.Big Brother U.S. currently uses a different set of rules that began with the second season (the first season used the traditional format). Nominations are done by one houseguest, the Head of Household (HoH) and the houseguests vote for which nominee to evict, not the viewers. The third season introduced the Power of Veto, where a houseguest can save a nominee causing the Head of Household to name a replacement nominee. It's been adapted in Brazil and Africa and since then some countries modified their nomination rules.The eighth American season introduced "America's Player," a houseguest that is given assignments, unknown to the other houseguests, through votes from the viewing public. Included in the public voting is which nominated houseguest America's Player should vote off and campaign to get evicted. (Dan was "America's Player" on Big Brother 10 (U.S.). This was also seen in the second Teen Edition, third regular season, fourth regular season and fourth Teen Edition of the Philippine version as the "House Player."The third Dutch edition introduced the notion of "The Battle," in which the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half, with two teams of housemates constantly fighting for time in the luxurious half. Separated houses have also been used in:

U.S., 2009-present: Houseguests had to compete to become Haves or Have Nots. Have Nots were required to sleep in the Have Not Bedroom, which contained simply a large metal bed with a thin pillow and blanket for Season 11; but in Season 12 they were forced to sleep on a lawn chair. Have Nots were only able to eat slop and could only take cold showers. Big Brother 13 (U.S.)'s Have Not Room looked like an insane asylum padded room type room and the Have Nots for the week were forced to keep the lights on 24/7. In season 14, the houseguests had to sleep in the most "twisted" room yet, the beds are at a 360-degree angle with a metal bed with spikes (not sharp or harmfull though) and the walls look like a maze.

For example, in Big Brother 11, an HoH was tempted by opening the box to release ten thousand dollars into the house, the HoH chose to open the box, in which resulted the HoH being locked into the box as the money was released for the other houseguests to claim. In Big Brother 12, an HoH was tempted to open the box by being presented with the "Diamond Power of Veto" which was for the HoH to use within two weeks and if the HoH chose to use the power on themselves or someone else, they can then immediately nominate a new houseguest, the HoH took the power but resulted the a consequence into the house (see below).

The Big Brother Saboteur will not be eligible to win the game, but will be able to receive financial reward if they can reach the halfway point of the game. However, the Saboteur was evicted in the first week by the houseguests, therefore losing the possible reward. Later in the same season, Big Brother announced that a new Saboteur may be unleashed in the house by Pandora's Box (see above), and America voted on who they wanted the new Saboteur to be, and if they accept the offer, they have to act out two weeks of havoc in the house and if successful for those two weeks, he or she will earn a financial reward.Big Brother Africa 6 in 2011 is the first season of Big Brother in the world to have 2 winners, each getting $200,000.The thirteenth American season introduced "Dynamic Duos" for the first time, where 8 new houseguests would enter the house with 3 duos from seasons past.

The Head of Household would nominate one duo for eviction, and the power of veto could save one duo from the block. If someone's partner got evicted, the surviving partner would receive the big brother golden key, where they were immune from all evictions until there were 10 players left.

Big Bother: Why Did That Reality TV Show Become Such a Phenomenon?. Australia: University of Queensland Press. ISBN0-7022-3315-3.The Closer is an American television police procedural, starring Kyra Sedgwick as Brenda Leigh Johnson, a Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief. Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, and CIA-trained, Brenda has a reputation as a Closerthe nickname given to interrogators who not only solve a case, but obtain confessions that lead to convictions. Deputy Chief Johnson sometimes uses deceit and intimidation to persuade a suspect to confess. The series ran on TNT from June 13, 2005 to August 13, 2012.Brenda Leigh arrived at the LAPD to lead the Priority Murder Squad (PMS), quickly renamed Priority Homicide Division (PHD), a team that originally (Seasons 14) dealt solely with high-profile murder cases.During Season 4, after an embarrassing tangle with the press over just what was the criteria making a homicide a priority, Brenda manipulated circumstances so the division was reorganized into a much larger Major Crimes Division with a wider scope,[note 1] though the majority of plots still involved and focused on homicides like most any detective series. Most importantly to the show's plot lines, Commander Taylor's role was also changed from 'rival and in-house adversary' to that of 'unambiguously loyal subordinate', so that he was thereafter reporting directly to Deputy Chief Johnson and noticeably helpful as he coordinates interaction between the MCD and other units.Season five introduced Mary McDonnell as Captain Sharon Raydor, who went on to star in The Closer 's spin-off, Major Crimes.In season seven Brenda finds herself in civil legal difficulties, and the characters conclude that there must be a disloyal subordinate generating information leaks from within MCD. Taylor and Raydor take an active role in attempting to combat the leaker and the legal matters do not reach a final resolution until the series end, in the episode "The Last Word".On December 10, 2010, TNT announced that the upcoming seventh season of The Closer, which began production in the spring of 2011, will be the show's last. The channel said that the decision to retire the show was made by Kyra Sedgwick.[2][3]On January 30, 2011, the media announced that the final season would add six episodes to the usual fifteen episode order, the final six being the build toward a possible spin-off series.[4] On May 18, 2011, TNT announced that the spin-off, entitled Major Crimes and starring Mary McDonnell as Captain Sharon Raydor, had been picked up for a 10-episode season.[5]The Closer was created by James Duff and the Shephard/Robin Company in association with Warner Bros. Television. On Monday, July 11, 2011, the series began its seventh season, scheduled to be its last, despite finishing its sixth season as cable's highest rated drama.[6] The Closer 's final six episodes began airing on Monday, July 9, 2012, with its finale airing on Monday, August 13, 2012. Following the finale, The Closer 's spin-off Major Crimes premiered.The cast consists largely of an ensemble of detectives who make up the LAPD's fictional Major Crimes Division. It is led by Kyra Sedgwick as Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson. Some observers have noted strong similarities between Johnson and Jane Tennison, the lead character in the British crime drama, Prime Suspect, played by Helen Mirren, with an article in USA Today calling The Closer "an unofficial Americanization" of the British series.[7] In interviews, Sedgwick has acknowledged that the show owes "a debt" to the British crime drama, and that her admiration for that show, and for Mirren, were factors that first interested her in the role.[8]Other main characters include Johnson's superior officer, Assistant Chief Will Pope (J.K. Simmons), Robbery-Homicide Commander Russell Taylor (Robert Gossett) and her FBI agent husband Fritz Howard (Jon Tenney). The remainder of the cast makes up Brenda's squad, each with expertise in a specific area such as crime scene investigation or gang activity. The first departure from the cast occurred in Season Five when actress Gina Ravera (Irene Daniels) left and her character was transferred to another division in the LAPD.Mary McDonnell, a recurring cast member in seasons five and six, joined the cast full-time for season seven, continuing her role as Captain Sharon Raydor.[9]Each episode of The Closer deals with an aspect of the Los Angeles culture as it interfaces with law enforcement in the mega-city. The show deals with complex and subtle issues of public policy ethics, personal integrity, and profound questions of good and evil. The rather large character ensemble explores the human condition, touching on individual faiths, traditional religious influences in the lives and communities of contemporary society, and the breakdown and dysfunction of family systems, work teaming, and government responsibility.[citation needed]Both gender researchers and members of the media have claimed that the series has "expanded the vocabulary of what is acceptable for women as seen through the lens of popular culture."[10]Media experts have also noted that the series has helped to redefine the place of basic cable channels alongside network programming:Viewer numbers (based on average total viewers per episode) of The Closer on TNT. The debut of The Closer was seen by more than 7 million viewers according to Nielsen Media Research and was the top-rated premiere episode ever of any original scripted series on basic cable. The second (8.28) and third season (8.81) premieres broke the previous record.At the end of Season Three, The Closer became ad-supported cable's most-viewed scripted series of all time, ending the season with a live + same day audience of 9.21 million viewers in 6.84 million households. The third season finale holds the record for the largest live + 7 day audience for a single episode of an ad-supported cable series with 9.55 million viewers in 6.88 million households. Live + 7 day (DVR) data for the season reflects 3040% audience growth in three key age-based demographic groups.[24] Season Four's premiere slipped slightly from the Season Three opening, with live + same day ratings showing a 3% decline in audience from the previous year's opener.[25] For its Season Six premiere, on July 12, 2010, the show reached an estimated 7.66 million viewers.[21][26]Warner Home Video has released the first six seasons of The Closer on DVD in Region 1.[27]Up until the Primetime Emmy Awards in 2011, Kyra Sedgwick had made history as being the only female actor in the history of television to be nominated for an Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild award every year that the show aired in the eligibility period. However, that came to an end in 2011.Screen Actors Guild AwardsSaturn AwardsPrimetime Emmy AwardsGolden Globe AwardsSatellite AwardsPRISM AwardsImagen Foundation AwardsWriters Guild of America

considered for deletion.The Close Home - The Closer WikiWeeds is an American dark comedy-drama[1][2][3] television series created by Jenji Kohan and produced by Tilted Productions in association with Lionsgate Television.[4] The central character is Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), a widowed mother of two boys who begins selling marijuana to support her family after her husband dies suddenly of a heart attack. Over the course of the show, she and her family become more entangled in illegal activities on an escalating scale. The series concluded with its eighth season on September 16, 2012.The primary locale of the first three seasons is in the fictional town of Agrestic, California. During seasons four and five, the Botwins reside in the fictional beachside town of Ren Mar in San Diego County, California. During the sixth season, the family relocates to Seattle, Washington before moving to Dearborn, Michigan. In between seasons six and seven, Nancy serves a prison sentence in Connecticut while her sons and brother-in-law live in Copenhagen, Denmark. At the beginning of season seven, Nancy moves into a halfway house in New York City where she reunites with her family. They live in Manhattan for the duration of the season, but relocate to Connecticut in the season seven finale and throughout season eight.The show debuted on the Showtime cable network on August 7, 2005, earning the channel's highest ratings. The show concluded after airing its eighth season.[5][6] In 2012, TV Guide Network bought the airing rights, providing an edited version of the show to audiences free of charge.[7] The show has received numerous awards, including two Satellite Awards, one Golden Globe Award, a Writers Guild of America Award, a Young Artist Award, and 2 Emmy Awards.The show is inspired by crime series such as The Shield and The Sopranos, in the sense of the antivillain serving as the protagonist while retaining an individual moral code, which usually goes against the norms of society. The title, according to Kohan, refers "to a lot of things", including marijuana and widow's weeds; however, it mainly alludes to "hardy plants struggling to survive." The basic premise, as illustrated by the lyrics of the opening song from the first three seasons as well its eighth, satirizes off-color characters struggling with faux suburban reality, in which everything is "all style, no substance".[1][8] According to Kohan, she first pitched the series to HBO, which dismissed it. Robert Greenblatt invested in the show and Showtime later approved.[9]Jenji Kohan, whose credits include Tracey Takes On..., Mad About You, and Sex and the City, is the executive producer of the series, alongside Roberto Benabib, of Little City fame.[10][11] Kohan serves as showrunner and head writer; she has written each season's premiere and finale episode. According to Kohan, when asked who "runs the writer's room," she said that she and Benabib "tag team". The writer Matthew Salsberg and director Craig Zisk joined the writing team as executive producers in later seasons;[1][7][12] however, Zisk departed the series after season five. Since then Mark A. Burley, director Scott Ellis, and Lisa I. Vinnecour have been added to the writing team as executive producers. By season eight, writers Victoria Morrow and Stephan Falk have moved up the ranks as co-executive producer.The exterior scenes for the show's first two seasons were shot almost exclusively in Stevenson Ranch, a suburban area of Santa Clarita Valley, California. The shot of the large fountain and Agrestic sign seen in the introduction of seasons 13 was shot at the corner of Stevenson Ranch Parkway and Holmes Place.[13] The name "Stevenson Ranch" was digitally replaced with "Agrestic" (and with "Majestic" and "Regrestic" in later episodes). The overhead satellite picture displayed at the beginning of the show's introduction (seasons 13) is of Calabasas Hills, a gated community in Calabasas, California. The shot of the "It's A Grind" coffee shop in the introduction (seasons 13) is of an It's A Grind in Castaic, California.[14] The show was originally filmed at Red Studios, previously known as Ren-Mar studios.[15] The show moved to Universal Studios in Los Angeles for season 7, where it is noted on the studio tour. A version of this Wikipedia page served as the introduction for the season 5 episode titled "Where the Sidewalk Ends".Nancy Botwin is a single mother who lives in Agrestic  a fictional suburb of Los Angeles  with her two children, Silas and Shane, who are aged 15 and 10 respectively when the series initially began airing. The pilot opens a few weeks after the untimely death of Nancy's husband Judah, who died of a heart attack while jogging with their younger son.[16] Nancy starts to sell marijuana to maintain her upper middle-class lifestyle originally provided by her late husband's structural engineering salary. The series follows the events in Nancy's life as she gets drawn into the criminal system, develops a client base, starts a front to hide her selling, creates her own strain of weed called MILF, constantly relocates her family, and tries to stay out of jail and protect her children. Featured in the ensemble cast are her lax brother-in-law Andy Botwin; foolish acquaintance Doug Wilson; and her narcissistically vulgar neighbor Celia Hodes, a manic PTA mother who left after the fifth season.The leading character is Nancy Price Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), a housewife from southern California who becomes a pot dealer after her husband Judah (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) dies. Although her drug-dealing career only achieves mixed success, she eventually rises to the highest levels of an international drug-smuggling cartel. Nancy remarries three times during the series. First, she has an under-the-radar wedding with Peter Scottson (Martin Donovan), a DEA agent, who was later killed. In season five, she marries Esteban Reyes (Demin Bichir), the fictional mayor of Tijuana and leader of a cartel, who is murdered by the seventh season. While serving time in prison, Nancy also establishes a long-term relationship with Zoya, a woman convicted for murdering her boyfriend. In the series finale, which leaps forward seven years, viewers come to know that Nancy married Rabbi David Bloom, who later died in a car accident.Throughout most of the show, Nancy shares her house with her brother-in-law Andy Botwin (Justin Kirk). When Andy arrives in Agrestic, he is little more than a fun-loving slacker without any direction in his life, and Nancy views him as a personal burden. He later, nonetheless, emerges as the primary father figure in the Botwin household. He falls in love with Nancy during the fourth season but eventually realizes that she will never return his feelings. Nancy tries to balance their relationship to keep him "in the family." When he is not helping the family, Andy engages in a laundry list of business ventures, ranging from marijuana dealer to bicycle salesman.Nancy begins the series with two sons, and post-Judah's death, they are raised haphazardly. In the fifth season, she has a son, Stevie Ray Botwin (portrayed by uncredited babies and later by Ethan and Gavin Kent), with Esteban Reyes. Her first son, Silas (Hunter Parrish), who has been engaging in sex since the show's debut, later follows in his mother's footsteps: he becomes a cannabis dealer, grower, and dispensary operator.Nancy's youngest son, Shane (Alexander Gould), is highly intelligent yet poorly socialized and vulgar; he is deeply affected by his father's death. In the first three seasons, he was bullied in his local public school. He begs for more attention from his mother than he receives. His psychological issues many times reach a critical level. Just before leaving Agrestic, Shane has conversations with his dead father. Upon moving to Ren Mar, Shane loses his virginity and becomes a temporary alcoholic. While his mother is having a hostile conversation with Esteban's scornful ex-wife Pilar, and after she threatened both his and his brother's lives, Shane abruptly kills Pilar with a croquet mallet. During season seven, Shane joins the police academy before receiving his criminal justice degree  working for the New York City Police Department in season eight.Celia Hodes (Elizabeth Perkins) is Nancy's friend and principal antagonist. Obsessed with her personal image, she manipulates those around her who do not fit neatly into that image. She is unhappily married to Dean (Andy Milder), whom she regards as a "loser asshole"; they later divorce. Many characters also dislike her. Her older daughter, Quinn (Haley Hudson), kidnaps her as revenge for shipping her to a reform school in Mexico. Celia is demanding over her younger daughter Isabelle's (Allie Grant) "weight problem", and is displeased with her being a lesbian. At the end of season one, Celia is diagnosed with breast cancer and is cured with chemo therapy. After the fifth season, the actress left to pursue other projects.Doug Wilson (Kevin Nealon) begins the series as an accountant and city councilman for the town of Agrestic. Doug is friends with many characters in the series including Andy, Dean and Sanjay Patel (Maulik Pancholy); all four aid Nancy's career as a marijuana retailer. Doug makes mistakes and loses his position; his wife Dana leaves him. He becomes a drifter who follows the Botwin family during seasons four through eight. Both the Botwin family and he move to New York City, where he becomes the chief accountant for a Ponzi scheme posing as a hedge fund.The show has a changing cast of major supporting characters. Heylia James (Tonye Patano) and her family  Conrad and Vaneeta, portrayed by Romany Malco and Indigo, respectively  play key roles during the first three seasons. They are wholesalers who supply marijuana to Nancy, who in turn distributes to retail customers. Conrad later develops his own strain of marijuana, called MILF weed, which Nancy sells.Season three features Sullivan Groff (Matthew Modine), an unethical, womanizing real estate developer with big plans for Agrestic. When Nancy moves to Ren Mar, the characters in Esteban's drug cartel take a leading role, primarily Cesar (Enrique Castillo), Ignacio (Hemky Madera), and Guillermo (Guillermo Daz), the latter first appearing in the third season. Other key characters include Nancy's housekeeper Lupita (Rene Victor); rival drug dealers; countless law enforcement characters; the romantic interests of Andy, Silas, and Shane; and the residents of Agrestic and Ren Mar.In the sixth season, Nancy is on the run, and most introduced characters have only minor roles and appear in one or two episodes. An exception to this is Warren Schiff (Richard Dreyfuss), who has an affectionate love for Nancy, having met her first as her math teacher in high school. When the Botwins and Doug settle in New York City, another set of supporting characters are introduced. The family later settle in Nancy's estranged sister Jill's (Jennifer Jason Leigh) house in Connecticut, who becomes a regular guest character in the eighth season.Other guest recurring characters include Albert Brooks as Nancy's father-in-law Lenny, Carrie Fisher as a lawyer for Celia, Dave Thomas as a doctor, Martin Short as a lawyer for Nancy's custody battle, Alanis Morrissette as a doctor at an abortion clinic, Zooey Deschanel as Andy's estranged ex-girlfriend, Lee Majors as a border guard, Mary-Kate Olsen as an estranged girl who worships Jesus and sells pot, as well as Aidan Quinn and others.As of September, 16 2012, 102 original episodes of Weeds have been produced and broadcast. The first season began August 8, 2005 and consisted of 10 episodes. The second season premiered on August 14, 2006, airing 12 episodes. The third season debuted on August 13, 2007, airing 15 episodes. The fourth season began June 16, 2008, the fifth season on June 8, 2009, and the sixth in August 2010, each with a total of 13 episodes. The seventh season began airing on June 27, 2011, and, as of November 10, 2011, Weeds was renewed for an eighth season with 13 episodes, premiering Sunday, July 1, 2012.[17][18]In 2006, before Season 2 started airing on Showtime, the first few episodes were leaked online.[19] Before the third season began, the first two episodes appeared online on July 22, 2007 (nearly a month before the August 13 premiere date). The third episode appeared online on July 24, with the fourth appearing just three days later. The fourth episode was, however, an incomplete versionamong other things, some dubbed lines were not complete (notably part of a voice mail message by U-Turn is spoken by a distinctly different actor), and a card simply reading "End Credits" was inserted instead of the actual credits. On August 1, 2010, the first episodes of season 6 leaked online. Due to the high quality of the leaked episodes, downloaders of the torrents speculated that they were leaked intentionally to garner interest in the show and to create internet buzz.[19] Episode leaks of other Showtime programs such as Californication and Dexter were seen as giving weight to this theory.[19]Jenji Kohan has stated that she does not mind episodes being distributed on the internet in this way, saying, "Revenue aside, I don't expect to get rich on Weeds. I'm excited it's out there. Showtime is great, but it does have a limited audience."[20] The show is rated TV-MA for drug content, profanity, nudity, brief violence, and other adult content."Little Boxes" is the opening song for the first three seasons of the show; the version recorded by the composer, Malvina Reynolds,[21] is used during the first season. In seasons 2 and 3, the song is performed by various artists. In season 4, the Malvina Reynolds version opens the first episode. Thereafter, the original titles and music are replaced by a short clip, different for each episode, which bears relevance to the plot or some scene later in the episode. During the opening credits of the show's eighty-fourth episode, a woman is heard humming the tune to Little Boxes as she arranges knickknacks on a shelf. The song is also subtly referenced in the eighth episode of the fourth season when a sleepy Nancy tells Shane that he's going to "become a doctor or a lawyer or a business executive." In the eighth episode of season seven, a person can be heard humming the theme song. In Season 8, they return to using "Little Boxes" for the opening sequence.The music supervisors for the show include Gary Calamar (along with music coordinator Alyson Vidoli) (27 episodes), Amine Ramer (4 episodes), and Bruce Gilbert (3 episodes). The original score is provided by composers Brandon Jay and Gwendolyn Sanford.The Region 1 Season One DVD is only available in 4:3 pan and scan format. The Region 2 and 4 releases are all in anamorphic widescreen. Season one was released on Blu-ray on May 29, 2007, and Season two was released on July 24, 2007. Both seasons include all episodes in 1080p widescreen with Dolby Digital EX sound and either DTS-HD (season one) or LPCM (season two), as well as extras exclusive to the Blu-ray release. Season three was released on Blu-ray on June 3, 2008. Seasons one to three on Blu-ray are multi-region discs; however, season four has been region-locked to region A only. This is due to a lack of broad international pick-up by non-US broadcasters at the time of release. This implies that Showtime does not wish to prejudice any future transmission rights negotiations by having the season available to own before it could be broadcast in the countries concerned.In late 2009, Weeds seasons four and five have been aired in at least one region B country, namely The Netherlands.[26] Subsequently, a region 2 DVD of Season 4 has indeed been released.[27][28] However, the region 2 DVD release was not accompanied by a region B Blu-ray. Showtime has not commented on whether they ever anticipate releasing a region B Blu-ray version, or if any further non-US transmission rights are agreed. The same region locking has been applied to Blu-ray for season five.[29] In November 2011, Seasons 25 were released on Region B Blu-ray in Australia with Season 6 Region B Blu-ray released December 16, 2011.[30] Blu-ray season seven is now available.[31]An extra feature on the Season Two DVD was rejected by the British Board of Film Classification since it was regarded as "likely [...] to promote and encourage the use of illegal drugs".[32][33]On August 7, 2007, Simon Spotlight, a division of Simon and Schuster, published In the Weeds: The Official Guide to the Showtime Series by Kera Bolonik, which features interviews with the show's creator, its writer-producers, and the entire cast. It also features detailed character and plot descriptions, recipes, trivia and behind-the-scenes information.[34]In its first year, Weeds was the highest rated series for Showtime.

The series follows the lives of eight housemates spending their summer at the Jersey Shore in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Season 2 followed the cast escaping the cold northeast winter to Miami Beach, with Season 3 returning to the Jersey Shore. The fourth season, filmed in Italy, premiered on August 4, 2011.[1][2][3] The show returned for a fifth season, at Seaside Heights on January 5, 2012.[1] The fifth season finale aired on March 15, 2012. On March 19, 2012, MTV confirmed that the series would return for their sixth season.[4] On August 30, 2012, MTV announced that the series will end after the sixth season, which premiered on Oct. 4.[5]The show debuted amid large amounts of controversy regarding the use of the words "Guido/Guidette," portrayals of Italian-American stereotypes, and scrutiny from locals because the cast members were not residents of the area.[6][7][8]The series has garnered record ratings for MTV, making it the network's most viewed series telecast ever.[9] The series' cast has also been credited with introducing unique lexicon and phrases into American popular culture.The University of Chicago and the University of Oklahoma are among the educational institutions that have had classes or conferences about the show.[10][11][12] In 2010, the cast of Jersey Shore was named on Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People list,[11] and the series has since been exported to dozens of countries worldwide.[13]VH1 producer Anthony Beltempo proposed the idea of a show focusing on the "guido" lifestyle for TV, in the form of a competition series. Executive producer SallyAnn Salsano, who previously worked on A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila, devised a new concept, inspired by her summers in a Jersey summer share house, and retained Casting Director Doron Ofir to find the cast. MTV Networks President Van Toffler felt that the series "loud, young, bold" style was better suited to MTV's sensibilities than VH1, and MTV programming executive Tony DiSanto felt that "[After The Hills], it was time to go for a more authentic approach, like a documentary." Van Toffler described the casting process by saying they looked for "candor, honesty, boldness and a very combustible, chaotic mess. You could honestly say none of these people were traditionally beautiful."[14]The series follows the lives of eight housemates spending their summer in a summer share in Seaside Heights, New Jersey. Season 1 followed cast members Angelina Pivarnick, Jennifer Farley, Michael Sorrentino, Nicole Polizzi, Paul DelVecchio, Ronald Ortiz-Magro, Samantha Giancola, and Vincenzo Guadagnino at the Jersey Shore. Jersey Shore premiered on December 3, 2009, with back-to-back episodes, averaging 1.375 million viewers.[15] Although the initial ratings were considered unimpressive to Salsano, they slowly grew in popularity, and was the subject of parody on Saturday Night Live after the third week, a turnaround that MTV executive Tony DiSanto calls "the fastest 0 to 60 I've ever seen on a show."[14] Season 1 posted strong growth every week and ranked #1 in its time period versus all cable competition among P1234 (people 12 to 34 years old) during the first quarter of 2010, with a season high 2.6 rating for the finale.[16] The season 1 finale audience, 4.8 million, was more than triple that of the premiere, an increase of more than 3.4 million, and was MTVs highest rated original series telecast in almost two years.[16] Overall, the season 1 averaged 2.7 million viewers.[17]In an article in Rolling Stone, it was mentioned that the house had 35 remote-controlled cameras in fixed locations, 12 hand-held ones, one IMX camera and six DV cameras.[18] Nicole Polizzi said that:After Season 1, the cast negotiated pay raises, though both they and DiSanto explained that it was not contentious, and was given undue weight by the press. Rather than wait until the next New Jersey summer for Season 2, the production moved to Miami.[14]In January 2010 MTV announced that a second season consisting of 12 episodes had been ordered and would air that summer.[19][20][21] It would follow all of the first season cast as they avoided the cold northeast winter[19][20] by relocating to the South Beach, Florida. In May 2010 the cast relocated back to the Jersey Shore for the rest of filming, but it was later determined that the production company had enough footage from the Miami shoot to fill the entire second season,[22] and that the footage to be shot at the Jersey Shore would be used for a third season.[23] The second season premiered on July 29, 2010,[23] averaging 5.252 million viewers.[24] Season 2 was the #1 television series in the P12-34 demographic for the summer of 2010 across all TV and has also posted continued growth every week.[25]On July 20, 2010, MTV announced that the cast, would return for a third season,[13][26][27] with the exception of Pivarnick.[28] Season 3 returned to the original Jersey Shore summer setting,[13][26] and replaced Angelina with Deena Nicole Cortese, a longtime friend of Polizzi.[29] The season's January 6, 2011 premiere was viewed by a record 8.45 million viewers, making it MTV's most viewed series telecast ever.[9][30] The second episode of the season once again set a series and MTV high, with 8.56 million viewers,[31] only to set another record with the airing of the fourth episode, which garnered 8.87 million viewers.[32]On January 25, 2011, it was confirmed that the show had been renewed for a fourth season, to be filmed in Italy during the first half of 2011.[2][3] The fourth season premiered August 4, 2011.[3] MTV confirmed in June 2011 that the fifth season will return to Seaside Heights.[33]Believed complications caused by Nicole Polizzi's pregnancy, and several cast members (including Polizzi, DelVecchio, and Farley) receiving spin-offs sparked talk about the future of the series past the fifth season, however on March 19, 2012, MTV officially confirmed that the series would return for a sixth season, with all cast members expected to return. Filming for the sixth season is expected to take place in Summer 2012, which will see Polizzi nearly eight months pregnant. MTV said in a statement, "While things will definitely be a little different this time when they hit the boardwalk, their trademark hilarity and family dysfunction will remain the same".[34]On February 23, 2010, Amazon.com and MTV teamed up to release Jersey Shore on DVD.[70] The title theme, "Get Crazy" by LMFAO has been changed.[citation needed] Other songs have been changed since their original air date as well.[citation needed] A retail release by Paramount Home Entertainment with added commentary was released on July 20.[71] Although it is claimed the DVDs are uncensored, the video and some audio is still censored.[72] The DVD also includes special features include deleted scenes, the reunion special, "Tips From The Situation and Snooki," "Before the Shore," and the "Jersey Shore Makeover with Michael Cera" amongst others.[73] On December 28, 2010 the Season 2 Uncensored DVD was released. On July 26, 2011 the Season 3 Uncensored DVD was released. On December 27, 2011 the Season 4 Uncensored DVD was released. On August 28, 2012 the Season 5 Uncensored DVD was released.A soundtrack to the series was released by MTV and Universal Republic on July 20, 2010.[74][75] Aimed to create the perfect summer playlist, the album features songs from a variety of artists including Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull, Taio Cruz, Ludacris, Lil Jon, 3OH!3, David Guetta, Fergie, Chris Willis, Girlicious and LMFAO as well as DJs like Deadmau5, Steve Aoki, Tisto, Diplo, Paul Oakenfold and Delvecchio.[75] A deluxe edition of the album was also released containing a bonus CD featuring songs inspired from the first season of the show, like LMFAO's "Get Crazy."[74] The first single off the album was Enrique Iglesias' "I Like It",[74] whose video also featured the Jersey Shore cast.[76] In September 2010, Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio ranked Delvecchio's rap song off the soundtrack, "(It's Time to) Beat Dat Beat", as the #1 Worst Song Ever on the list of the 100 Worst Songs Ever; as a bonus, Wilkening used Delvecchio's quote as the reason for the #1 list: "Being a guido's a way of life. I don't represent all Italians, I represent myself. I started this whole GTL shit (Gym, Tan, Laundry). You have to stay fresh to death."[77]A quote book titled Gym, Tanning, Laundry: The Official Jersey Shore Quote Book (ISBN 978-1-4391-9682-3) was released by MTV on June 15, 2010.[78] The book also includes a bonus DVD with the most memorable moments from season one of the show.[79] A sticker book titled Jersey Shore Sticker Activity Book (ISBN 0-7666-3904-5) was also released on the same date,[80] as well as a 2011 wall calendar (ISBN 0-7407-9797-2) by Andrews McMeel Publishing.[81]Other merchandise relating to the show have also been released, including talking bobblehead dolls of the cast,[82] a beach game set,[83] Halloween costumes,[84] a "Gym Tanning Laundry (GTL)" labeled sports bottle,[85] "The Situation - Official App" for iPhone,[86] as well as various T-Shirts.[87]The cast of Jersey Shore appeared on the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.[88] Nicole Polizzi appeared on TLC's Cake Boss episode "Snookie, Super Anthony & a Ship" on November 8, 2010, in which she orders a cake for her mom. Polizzi also appeared on the March 14th, 2011 edition of WWE Raw as the guest host and she wrestled a professional wrestling match on April 4, 2011 at WrestleMania XXVII.[89] Jennifer Farley and Angelina Pivarnick appeared on various episodes of TNA Impact in 2011.[90][91] The cast of Jersey Shore appears on MTV's Season 4 of Disaster Date, starring Jen Lilley, Lauren Zima, Cale Hartmann, Jason Karasev, Russell Pitts, Hasan Minhaj, Diarra Kilpatrick, and Kara Luiz.[92] Angelina Pivarnick appeared in the show NY Ink in which she got a tattoo that shows her time in Jersey Shore.MTV received criticism from Italian American organizations for the way in which they marketed the show, as it liberally used the word Guido to describe the cast members.[93] The term "guido" is generally regarded as an ethnic slur when referring to Italians and Italian Americans. One promotion stated that the show was to follow, "eight of the hottest, tannest, craziest Guidos,"[94] while yet another advertisement stated, "[the show] exposes one of the tri-state area's most misunderstood species... the GUIDO. Yes, they really do exist! Our Guidos and Guidettes will move into the ultimate beach house rental and indulge in everything the Seaside Heights, New Jersey scene has to offer."[95]Cast members Snooki and JWoww are not ethnically[clarification needed] Italian. Snooki is Chilean, but was adopted as an infant by Italian American parents. Jwoww is Irish and Spanish.[96]Prior to the series debut, UNICO National formally requested that MTV cancel the show.[97] In a letter to the network, UNICO called the show a "...direct, deliberate and disgraceful attack on Italian Americans..."[98] UNICO National President Andre DiMino said in a statement "MTV has festooned the 'bordello-like' house set with Italian flags and green, white and red maps of New Jersey while every other cutaway shot is of Italian signs and symbols. They are blatantly as well as subliminally bashing Italian-Americans with every technique possible..."[99] Around this time, other Italian-American organizations joined the fight, including the NIAF,[100] the Order Sons of Italy in America and the internet watch-dog ItalianAware.[101][102]MTV responded to the controversy by issuing a press release which stated in part, "the Italian-American cast takes pride in their ethnicity. We understand that this show is not intended for every audience and depicts just one aspect of youth culture."[93] Since the calls for the show's removal, several sponsors have requested that their ads not be aired during the show. These sponsors include Dell, Domino's and American Family Insurance.[103]In a February 2010 interview, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called the show "negative for New Jersey" because most of the cast members are not from the state. According to Christie, the program "takes a bunch of New Yorkers and drops them at the Jersey Shore and tries to make America feel like this is the real New Jersey." Governor Christie took action against the series by trying to encourage people to experience the real Jersey Shore for themselves rather than watch it through MTV: "I can tell people: They want to know what New Jersey really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time."[104] A Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll released in February 2010 showed that 59% of Americans who had seen the show had a favorable view of New Jersey compared to only 44% of those that had not seen the show.[105] The FDU poll repeated the national telephone survey in 2011 and showed similar results.[106] Consequently poll director Peter Woolley concluded that These measures... suggest the show isnt hurting the nations view of the state. In fact, it may be promoting one of the states best features--not Snooki, but the shore itself."[107]Nonetheless, in September 2011, Governor Christie vetoed a $420,000 tax incentive awarded to the show by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, stating: "As chief executive, I am duty-bound to ensure that taxpayers are not footing a $420,000 bill for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens."[108]An episode featuring several parodies were made into a special entitled Jersey Shore: Spoof'd, which aired on January 16, 2010, featuring a cast commentary highlighting internet and television spoofs that have sprung up as a direct response to the show. The program also included the original cast audition tapes.[109]Several songs have been remixed to poke fun at the show and its characters, including "Tik Tok" by Kesha, "Empire State of Mind" by Jay-Z, and a spoof of "California Girls" by Katy Perry entitled "Staten Island Girls".[110]The webcomic Jersey Circus is a mashup of artwork from the newspaper comic strip The Family Circus and dialogue from Jersey Shore. It juxtaposes the innocent artwork of the comic with often adult dialogue from the show to parody both media phenomena.[111]On the animated sketch comedy Mad on Cartoon Network, they made a mashup of the Disney Pixar movie Up and Jersey Shore which they named "S'UP", as well as another episode where Jersey Shore was mashed up with the movie Thor, which was named "Jersey THOR".On October 7, 2010, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling debuted two characters by the names of "Robbie E" and "Cookie" forming the team "The Shore" as a parody of DelVecchio and Polizzi.[112] Jenni Farley, accompanied by The Beautiful People, appeared on the October 14, 2010 edition of TNA Impact! and got into a catfight with Cookie.[113][114][115] Angelina Pivarnick appeared alongside Robbie E and Cookie on the March 3, 2011, edition of Impact! and challenged Farley to a match.[116] The following week she wrestled in a match, where she, Cookie and Sarita were defeated by the Beautiful People (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky) and Winter.[117]The ninth episode of the fourteenth season of South Park, entitled "It's a Jersey Thing", parodied the cast of Jersey Shore, referring to the on-coming citizens of New Jersey as "Jerseyites", as the said invaders plan to make all of the United States into New Jersey.[118]In several episodes of the 8th season of MTV's Beavis and Butt-Head there were scenes where Beavis and Butt-Head would watch Jersey Shore while poking fun out of it.A video, which may be viewed on YouTube, while pictures can also be seen on the internet, with the characters of Twilight being seen if they, instead of being cast with Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattison, the characters are "instead cast as Jersey Shore". The video is fanmade as well as a parody of both Twilight and Jersey Shore with Bella being portrayed by Snooki, Jenny as Alice, Mike as Edward, whom seemingly is just as in love with his looks as with Bella/Snooki; the Cullen family: Ron and Sam as the Cullen parents, Angelina as Victoria, while Vinny is a teenager whom the Situation uses to protect Snooki from an oncoming van which would have killed her.In Vampires Suck, Becca sees the Jersey Shore cast in the cafeteria at school.On April 7, 2011, MTV announced it had picked up two spin-off shows featuring cast members Farley, Polizzi, and Delvecchio, picking up twelve episodes of each show. One show will focus on Polizzi and Farley living together after the conclusion of Jersey Shore. It will be called Snooki & JWoww, and will premiere in 2012.[119][120] The other show will follow Delvecchio jet-setting around the country for various DJ gigs. The show was called The Pauly D Project. Filming for both shows started at the end of 2011, with the shows been premiered in 2012. SallyAnn Salsano of 495 Productions (Jersey Shore) is the executive producer of both spin-offs.[119]Three official remakes have been made, two in the United Kingdom and one in Spain.Other somewhat similar shows to Jersey Shore that have been planned or aired, include:Jersey Shore at TV.com1 Production history2 Episodes3 Cast4 Media and merchandise

It is a talent show that features singers, dancers, magicians, comedians, and other performers of all ages competing for the advertised top prize of one million dollars. The show debuted in June 2006 for the summer television season. From season three onwards, the prize includes the one million dollars, payable in a financial annuity over 40 years (or the present cash value of such annuity), and a show as the headliner on the Las Vegas Strip.Among its significant features were that it gave an opportunity to talented amateurs or unknown performers, with the results decided by an audience vote. The format is a popular one and has often been reworked for television in the United States and the United Kingdom.The current incarnation was created by Simon Cowell, and was originally due to be a 2005 British series called Paul O'Grady's Got Talent[2] but was postponed due to O'Grady's acrimonious split with broadcaster ITV (later launching as Britain's Got Talent). As such, the American version became the first full series of the franchise. Despite Cowell's involvement in the show's production, his contract with Fox for his involvement with American Idol prevented him from being involved in the show as a judge. After leaving Idol however, Cowell began to produce and judge a version of The X Factor for Fox in 2011.The general selection process of the show begins with separate producers' auditions held in various cities across the United States, some which host only the producers' auditions, and some which also host judges' auditions held in theaters. This round is held several months before the judges' audition. Acts that have made it through the producers' audition will then audition in front of the judges and a live audience.Following the producers' auditions, acts audition in front of three celebrity judges. These auditions are held in theaters in various cities nationally and are later televised. The judges may terminate an act's performance early by pressing their red buzzer, which lights up their corresponding X above the stage. If an act receives three X's, they must stop their performance. Since season three, large audiences have also been a factor in the judging process, as their reaction to an act's performance may swing or influence a judge's vote. If an act receives two or more "yes" votes, they advance to the next round of competition. However, in the majority of seasons, several acts do not perform in the second round and are immediately sent home by the judges without a second performance.Since season two, Las Vegas Week has been an intermediary televised taped round between the auditions and the live shows. This round takes place in a notable venue on the Las Vegas Strip. Names for this round in previous seasons has included "Las Vegas Callbacks" and "Vegas Verdicts". The Las Vegas round generally consists of acts performing a second time for the judges (with the exception of season 4), who then pick select acts to move on the live shows. An act eliminated in Las Vegas Week is not completely excluded from the live show competition, as several seasons have featured contestants being brought back from this round as "wild card" acts.Prior to the inclusion of this round, the judges would have a list containing a number of acts which advanced past the auditions during each live show. The judges would then pick ten acts from that group each week, leaving several acts without the chance to perform.Since season five, acts who do not attend live auditions may instead submit a taped audition online via YouTube. Acts from the online auditions are then selected to compete in front of the judges and a live audience during the "live shows" part of the season, prior to the semi-finals. The most successful of the YouTube auditions was Jackie Evancho, who went on to place second in season five.Before the inclusion of this round, the show had a separate audition episode in seasons three and four for contestants who posted videos on MySpace.During the live shows, a group of acts ranging from only a Top 20 (season 2), to as many as 48 (or morecounting the YouTube acts), compete for viewers' and judges' votes. In the first season, the judges could not end an act's performance, but could either "check" or "X" the performance during their critique. Since season two, judges have been able to end an act's performance early, and the "check" was removed. Acts generally each perform in a first live round consisting of a series of quarterfinals. In seasons with YouTube auditions, the round of live judging of YouTube finalists takes place then, as part of these quarterfinals. Then, there may be additional shows for "Wild Card" actsacts that one or more of the judges select to be given one more chance for audience vote despite previous elimination. From these shows, the existing group is narrowed through votes by the public and/or the judges (depending on the season). Acts then move on to a semifinal round, and even further rounds (such as a "Top 8" or a "Top 10", depending on the season) through a series of weekly shows, which trim the number of acts down each time based on a public vote. In the majority of seasons, judges have had no vote from the semifinals on. All these rounds culminate in a live final, which has consisted of anywhere from four to ten acts throughout the seasons. The act with the most votes is declared the winner, given $1 million, and, since season three, a chance to headline a show on the Las Vegas Strip.During seasons one through six, the live shows were filmed at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. Beginning with season seven, the live shows have been held at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.Since season 5, the show has also made the winner the headline act of a national tour with runners up following the final show, stopping in 25 cities.[3][4]In May 2006, NBC announced the new show. The audition tour took place in June. Auditions were held in the following locations: Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Atlanta. Some early ads for the show implied that the winning act would also headline a show at a casino, possibly in Las Vegas; however, this was replaced with $1,000,000 due to concerns of minors playing in Las Vegas, should one become a champion. More than 12 million viewers watched the season premiere (which is more than American Idol got during its premiere back in 2002). The two-hour broadcast was the night's most-watched program on U.S. television and the highest-rated among viewers aged 18 to 49 (the prime-time audience that matters most to advertisers), Nielsen Media Research reported.[5] On the season finale, there was an unaired segment that was scheduled to appear after Aly & AJ. The segment featured Tom Green dressing in a parrot costume, and squawking with a live parrot, to communicate telepathically. Green then proceeded to fly up above the audience, shooting confetti streamers out of his costume onto the crowd below.In season one, the show was hosted by Regis Philbin and judged by actor David Hasselhoff, singer Brandy Norwood, and journalist Piers Morgan.The winner of the season was 11-year old singer Bianca Ryan, and the runners-up were clogging group All That, and musical group The Millers.After initially announcing in June 2006 that season two would premiere in January 2007 and would air at 8 PM on Sunday nights, with no separate results show, the network changed that, pushing the show back to the summer, where the first season had great success. This move kept the show out of direct competition with American Idol, which has a similar premise and is more popular. In AGT's place, another reality-based talent show, Grease: You're The One That I Want, began airing on Sunday nights in the same timeslot on NBC beginning in January.[6] In March 2007, NBC announced that Philbin would not return as host of the show, and that Jerry Springer would succeed him as host,[7] with Sharon Osbourne (formerly a judge on Cowell's UK show The X Factor) succeeding Brandy as a judge.Season two had no results show; replaced by results on the performance show night instead. In addition, each Tuesday broadcast was repeated (along with The Singing Bee episode that followed the 90-minute editions of AGT) by NBC the following Saturday.The season finale was shown Tuesday, August 21, 2007, with the winner being Terry Fator, a singing impressionist ventriloquist. The runner-up was singer Cas Haley.NBC announced in August 2007 that the network had renewed the show for a third season. It premiered on June 17, 2008. Auditions took place in Charlotte, Nashville, Orlando, New York, Dallas, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Chicago from January to April. A televised MySpace audition also took place. Sharon Osbourne, Piers Morgan and David Hasselhoff returned as judges. Jerry Springer also returned as host.Season three differed from the previous two in many ways. Auditions were held in well-known theaters across the nation, and a new title card was introduced, featuring the American flag as background. The X's match the ones on Britain's Got Talent as does the judges table. Like the previous season, the Las Vegas callbacks continued, but there were 40 acts selected to compete in the live rounds, instead of 20. This season also contained several results episodes, but not on a regular basis.The show took a hiatus for two and a half weeks for the 2008 Summer Olympics, but returned with the live rounds on August 26, 2008.Neal E. Boyd, an opera singer, was named the winner on October 1, 2008.Season four premiered on Tuesday, June 23. Season four is the first to be broadcast in high definition. Auditions for this season were held in more than nine major cities including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington DC, Atlanta, Miami, Tacoma, Boston and Houston. Los Angeles Auditions kicked off the tour January 2931 at the Los Angeles Convention Center, followed by Atlanta Auditions February 78. New York and Miami Auditions were held during March. Tacoma Auditions were held April 25 and 26. In addition to live auditions and the ability to send in a home audition tape, season four offered the opportunity for acts to upload their video direct at NBC.com/agt with their registration. This year's host is Nick Cannon, who replaced Jerry Springer. Springer said that he could not host due to other commitments.[8] All judges from season three returned for this season.[9]The audition process in season four is the same as the previous season, but the 'Las Vegas Callbacks' was renamed 'Vegas Verdicts'. This was the first season since season one where results episodes last one hour on a regular basis. The title card this year features bands of the American flag and stars waving around the America's Got Talent logo.At the end of Las Vegas week, Simon Cowell, the show's executive producer, called the judges by phone while they were flying back to Los Angeles, stating that he was unhappy with some of the eliminations the judges made. Cowell stated that this season had a lot of talent and presented the judges with eight acts he thought America should see again.[citation needed] As a result, two wild card acts performed each week along with the ten already scheduled to perform, expanding the Top 40 to the Top 48.On September 16, 2009, country music singer Kevin Skinner was named the season's winner. The grand prize was one million dollars and a 10-week headline show at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.[1]For season five, the network had considered moving the show to the fall, after rival series So You Think You Can Dance transferred from the summer to fall season in 2009.[10] However, NBC ultimately decided to keep Talent a summer show, which was also the fate of rival Dance.Open auditions were held in the winter to early spring of 2010 in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York City, Orlando, and Portland. Non-televised producers' auditions were also held in Atlanta and Philadelphia. For the first time, online auditions were also held via YouTube.For the 2010 season, David Hasselhoff left to host a new television show,[11] and was replaced by comedian and TV host Howie Mandel. This made Piers Morgan the only original judge left in the show.[12] The judging panel now consisted of two British judges and a Canadian one.The show premiered Tuesday, June 1 at 8PM ET. Afterward, Talent resumed the same time slot as the previous season.[13]On September 15, 2010, singer Michael Grimm was named the winner. He won a $1,000,000 prize and a chance to perform at the Caesars Palace Casino and Resort on the Las Vegas Strip, as well as headline the 25-city America's Got Talent Live Tour along with Jackie Evancho, Fighting Gravity, Prince Poppycock, and the other top ten finalists.[3][4]Season six premiered on Tuesday, May 31, 2011 for a two-hour special. Piers Morgan and Sharon Osbourne continued as judges after taking jobs on Piers Morgan Tonight and The Talk, respectively. On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on July 27, 2010, Morgan officially stated that he has signed a three year contract to stay on Talent.[14] In addition, Howie Mandel returned as a judge, and Nick Cannon returned as host.[15]The show held televised auditions in Los Angeles, New York, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Seattle, and Houston. Non-televised producers' auditions were also held in Denver and Chicago. Previews of auditions were shown during NBC's The Voice premiere on April 26, 2011. Online auditions via YouTube were also held for the second time in the show's run, beginning on May 4, 2011. Finalists for this audition circuit competed live on August 9.Due to the live shows of The Voice in June, AGT was aired one hour earlier than its usual Tuesday timeslot, at 8/7c. The show resumed its regular 9/8c timeslot on Tuesdays at the start of the live shows on July 12, 2011. AGT retained its regular Wednesday 9/8c timeslot throughout the season.On Wednesday, September 14, 2011, Landau Eugene Murphy, Jr., a Frank Sinatra style singer, was named the winner. Dance group Silhouettes was runner-up. He went on to headline at Caesars Palace Casino and Resort along with the other final four finalists as well as other fan favorites such as Anna Graceman and Landon Swank.[citation needed]On August 12, 2011, NBC confirmed that it was renewing America's Got Talent for a seventh season, which premiered on May 14, 2012.The first round of auditions, which are judged by producers were held in New York, Washington, D.C., Tampa, Florida, Charlotte, North Carolina, Austin, Texas, Anaheim, California, St. Louis, Missouri, and San Francisco, California from October 2011 to February 2012.[16] The show began its live theater performances in Newark, New Jersey's NJPAC on February 27.Piers Morgan did not return as a judge for season seven, due to his work hosting CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight,[17] and he was replaced by Howard Stern. Since Stern hosts his SiriusXM radio show in New York City, the live rounds of the show were moved to nearby Newark, New Jersey.[18] Simon Cowell, the show's executive producer, announced in December 2011 that the show would be receiving a "top-to-bottom makeover", confirming that there would be new graphics, lighting, theme music, show intro, logo, and a larger live audience at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.[19]On July 2, 2012, at the first live performance show of the season, their new location and stage were unveiled in a special two-and-a-half-hour live special. A new set was also unveiled with a revised judges' desk, and a refreshed design of the "X".On August 6, 2012, Sharon Osbourne announced that she would leave America's Got Talent after the current season, in response to allegations that her son Jack Osbourne was discriminated against by the producers of the upcoming NBC program Stars Earn Stripes.[20]On September 13, 2012, Olate Dogs were announced the winners of the season that night, the show's first completely non-singing act to win the competition. Subsequently, Tom Cotter finished as the runner-up, and is thus the show's highest-finishing stand-up comedian.The new season was announced in a promotional video shown during a commercial break for season seven's second live show. Sharon Osbourne initially stated that she will not return for the season,[21] but later said that she was staying with the show "for now."[22] Osbourne confirmed she would be leaving the show after a feud with NBC on August 6, 2012.[23][24] It has been reported that producer Simon Cowell wants Carmen Electra to replace former judge Osbourne.[25] According to TMZ, the network is in talks with Shannen Doherty, Carly Simon and LeAnn Rimes to take Osbourne's seat.[26] The networks fully expect Howard Stern, Howie Mandel and Nick Cannon to return.As of November 29, 2012, Cannon has officially signed on with the network to host Talent once again.[27]The show's producers are looking to revamp the show due to sinking ratings in season 7 [28] and a possible fourth judge may be added as Cowell planned that last year and with the success in ratings with the addition of a fourth judge on his other show, Britain's Got Talent.An audition cities poll for season eight were announced on July 11, 2012. The First batch of Audition Cities where announced and are Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland (OR), New Orleans, Birmingham, Memphis, Nashville, Savannah, Raleigh, Norfolk, San Antonio, and Chicago with 2 more cities (including NYC) to be announced shortly. This season will be the season where the auditions travel to more cities than ever before.[29]America's Got Talent Live is a show on the Las Vegas Strip that features the winner of each season of Talent as the main performance.In 2009, America's Got Talent Live appeared on the Las Vegas Strip appearing Wednesday through Sunday at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, in a limited 10-week run starting in October, 2009 through January of the next year. It featured the final ten acts which made it to the season four finale. Former host of the series, Jerry Springer, emceed, commuting weekly between Stamford, Connecticut tapings of his self-named show and Las Vegas.[30]In 2010, on the first live show of season five, the winner headlined America's Got Talent Live from Caesars Palace Casino and Resort on the Las Vegas Strip, which was part of a 25-city tour that featured the season's finalists. Jerry Springer returned as both host of the tour and the headline show.[31][32]Since the show began, its ratings have been very high, ranging from 9 million viewers to as many as 16 million viewers, generally averaging around 12 million viewers. The show has also ranked high in the 18-49 demographic, usually rating anywhere from as low as 2.0 to as high as 4.6 throughout its run. Average ratings have been around 3.0-3.9 for most seasons. Audition shows and performance shows rate higher on average than results shows.Although the show's ratings have been high, NBC has chosen not to place the show as a competitor in the fall or spring seasons for various reasons. A brief run by the show in the fall in 2008, which was due to NBC's coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics, proved to be underwhelming, with the series averaging only around 10 million viewers, and the finale down significantly from the previous year. During the first weeks of the fall season in 2009, however, a results show of America's Got Talent performed well against the season premiere of So You Think You Can Dance and the highly-promoted world premiere of Glee, posting 9.7 million viewers, compared to only 6.5 million viewers for So You Think You Can Dance and 7.1 million viewers for Glee. However, So You Think You Can Dance delivered poorly in the fall, which was likely a factor in NBC's decision to keep America's Got Talent in the summer.The highest rated season in overall viewers to date is season four. The most-watched episode has been the finale of season five, with 16.41 million viewers. The series premiere, and an episode featuring the first part of Las Vegas Week in season six, have each tied for highest rating among adults 1849, both having a 4.6 rating.The show is rated TV-PG.Sales numbers are American sales only.Many acts which have competed on America's Got Talent, but were ultimately eliminated before the final round, have either previously competed on or went on to compete in a number of other talent shows, most notably American Idol and America's Best Dance Crew.America's Got Talent at TV.com1 Selection process

For all seasons, the show is hosted by veteran television personality, one-time game show host and news anchor Chris Harrison. There are two related series: The Bachelorette and Bachelor Pad.It is produced and directed by Mike Fleiss and is shot by camera operator Jesse Fleiss.The series revolves around a single bachelor (deemed eligible) and a pool of romantic interests (typically 25; 30 in season 15), which could include a potential wife for the bachelor. The conflicts in the series, both internal and external, stem from the elimination-style format of the show. Early in the season, the bachelor goes on large group dates with the women, with the majority of women eliminated during rose ceremonies. As the season progresses, women are also eliminated on one-on-one dates and on elimination two-on-one dates. The process culminates with hometown visits to the families of the final four women, overnight dates at exotic locations with the final three women, and interaction with the bachelor's family with the final two women. In many cases, the bachelor proposes to his final selection.During most seasons, the majority of the show takes place, and the contestants reside, in "Villa De La Vina," a 7,590-square-foot (705m2), six-bedroom, nine-bath home in Agoura Hills, California. The custom home, built in 2005, is located on 10 acres at a confidential location. As of October 10, 2008, the home was listed for sale at a price of US$8.75 million.[1] This mansion is used throughout of most seasons of the show, with the exceptions of New York City, where Charlie O'Connell, who had appeared in Sliders with his brother Jerry O'Connell, lived, where season 7 was filmed; Paris, France for season 8; Rome, Italy for season 9, where Lorenzo Borghese is half-Italian and various locations in the U.S. such as California and Utah for season 16, where Ben Flajnik filmed his season in his hometown for early episodes of that season.The show is known for its twists, both structurally and contextually. In some cases, the bachelor may or may not follow the show's standard rose ceremony guidelines. Numerous bachelors, for instance, have conferred fewer roses than allotted as per standard rose ceremony procedure; others have eliminated both women on a two-on-one date. One bachelor, Brad Womack, selected neither of his final two women. Another, Jason Mesnick, proposed to one woman, and then changed his mind during the "After the Final Rose" show to the other finalist; Mesnick is now married to her. Other twists include a woman leaving the show for work-related reasons and the dismissal of one candidate for an alleged affair with an ex-producer of the show.The show's success has led producer Mike Fleiss to create multiple spin-offs, including The Bachelorette, in which the format is gender-reversed. Many bachelorettes are runner-ups or eliminated contestants from The Bachelor, including Trista Rehn, whose wedding to Ryan Sutter  the show's winner  was televised on ABC. On August 9, 2010, Bachelor Pad premiered, giving previous contestants of both The Bachelor and The Bachelorette the opportunity to compete in dating-themed eliminations for $250,000.According to the summary on ABC.com, each new Bachelor episode contains a rose ceremony during which one or more contestants is eliminated. Eliminations are based upon date performance (i.e., how the women relate to the bachelor on the dates). The bachelor must follow a process of elimination wherein his pool of bachelorettes is narrowed down week by week by presenting a rose to each of the women he wishes to keep.At any point during the process, if a woman decides she is no longer interested in the bachelor, she may leave. A few have actually done so over the course of the show.In the end, the bachelor may select only one woman for the final rose. Several of the bachelors have proposed, and one bachelor selected no one.As of the end of season 16, none of the bachelors has married the woman to whom he presented the final rose. The season 13 bachelor (Jason) ended up marrying his season's runner-up in February 2010; to this point, it is the only Bachelor season thus far to result directly in marriage.As of January 2012, The Bachelor and its popular spin-off show The Bachelorette have never featured a non-white contestant in the title role, in their combined 21 seasons. Furthermore, a disproportionate majority of the rest of the contestants featured on the show have been white.[43] When asked about the lack of minority representation on the two shows executive producer, Mike Fleiss, responded, "It's just that for whatever reason, they don't come forward. I wish they would."[44]Former contestants, as well as the show's creator, Mike Fleiss, have come forth asserting that both The Bachelor and The Bachelorette are scripted. The Bachelorette star Jesse Csincsak confesses that contestants must follow producers' orders and that a storyline is created in the editing room.[45]On February 26, 2009 in an exclusive interview between The Bachelor Season 13 contestant Megan Parris, and Steve Carbone, Megan explained how the producers edit the footage to create a fictional storyline. "I don't think [the producers] showed any real conversation I had with anyone... The viewers fail to realize that editing is what makes the show... You'll hear someone make one comment and then they'll show a clip of somebody's face to make it look like that is their facial reaction to that statement, but really, somebody made that face the day before to something else. It's just piecing things together to make a story."[46]On March 26, 2009 Megan Parris confessed that, not only is the show scripted, but that producers actually bully contestants into saying things to the camera that contestants do not want to say.[47] "'There's nothing real about it,' she said of the show's trademark "confessionals," in which contestants talk to the camera about the latest goings-on. "It is scripted," she said. "They basically will call you names, berate you, curse at you until they get you to say what they want you to say." Both ABC and Warner Bros., the studio that produces The Bachelor, had no comment."[48]On March 15, 2010 creator Mike Fleiss appeared on 20/20 confessing that he develops contestants into characters that will cater to his audience's tastes and that they "need [their] fair share of villains every season."[49] Fleiss has come under fire for admitting that The Bachelor has less to do with reality than it does making good television.[50]By 2011, during the airing of the The Bachelorette, Season 7, actors were being hired by ABC to play specific roles on the show.[51] Fans were becoming tired of the show's scripted nature and speaking out.[52] The following year there were many complaints when the entire cast of The Bachelorette openly acted out the written script with The Muppets.[53]On February 24, 2012, during the taping of The Women Tell All episode of The Bachelor, a private conversation between contestant Courtney Robertson and a show producer went public when microphones were accidentally left on in between camera takes. The conversation revealed the producer's role as an acting coach encouraging Robertson to fake certain emotions for the camera which she was not feeling.[54]The self-named Reality Steve (aka Steve Carbone) has been accurately leaking spoilers of The Bachelor since the 13th season in 2009.[55] He publishes rumors of the show, including its spin-offs The Bachelorette and Bachelor Pad on his blog.[56] In December 2011, the producer of The Bachelor sued Carbone for leaking information about the show. The suit claims that Carbone encouraged contestants on both The Bachelor and The Bachelorette to break their confidentiality agreements. Reality Steve has denied that the source of the spoilers and rumors are current contestants.[57]A video game based on the series has been released on the Wii and Nintendo DS.[58]Ben Stiller produced a web spoof of the series entitled Burning Love.[62]The Bachelor at TV.com1 Production2 Plot3 The elimination process4 Seasons5 Notes6 Controversies

TVThe Bachelor at VH1Glee is an American musical comedy-drama television series that airs on Fox in the United States. It focuses on the high school glee club New Directions competing on the show choir competition circuit, while its members deal with relationships, sexuality and social issues. The initial main cast encompassed club director and Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), Will's wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), and eight club members played by Dianna Agron, Chris Colfer, Kevin McHale, Lea Michele, Cory Monteith, Amber Riley, Mark Salling and Jenna Ushkowitz. For the second season, formerly recurring cast members Mike O'Malley, Heather Morris and Naya Rivera were promoted to the main cast. For the third season, Harry Shum, Jr. and Darren Criss were promoted from recurring to the main cast, and both Gilsig and O'Malley were removed from star billing, though the latter is again in the recurring guest cast. For the fourth season, Chord Overstreet was promoted from recurring to the main cast, and both Mays and Agron were removed from star billing; Mays' first appearance was credited in the recurring guest cast.The series was created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan, the last of whom first conceived of Glee as a film. The three wrote all of the show's episodes for the first two seasons, and Murphy and Falchuk served as the show's main directors. The pilot episode was broadcast on May19, 2009, and the first season aired from September9, 2009 to June8, 2010. The second season aired from September21, 2010 to May24, 2011, and the third season aired from September20, 2011 to May22, 2012. The show's fourth season premiered on Thursday, September13, 2012. Glee features on-screen performance-based musical numbers that are selected by Murphy, who aims to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits, and produced by Adam Anders. Songs covered in the show are released through the iTunes Store during the week of broadcast, and a series of Glee albums have been released by Columbia Records. The music of Glee has been a commercial success, with over thirty-six million digital single sales and eleven million album sales worldwide through October 2011. The series' merchandise also includes DVD and Blu-ray releases, a young adult book series, an iPad application, and three karaoke games for the Wii. There were live concert tours by the show's cast after the first and second seasons completed shooting. Murphy and Fox produced a concert film, Glee: The 3D Concert Movie, featuring performance and backstage footage from the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour. The film was directed by Kevin Tancharoen, and began its two-week limited release in the United States on August 12, 2011.During its first season, Glee received generally favorable reviews from critics, with Metacritic's weighted average of 77 out of 100 based on eighteen critical reviews. The season was nominated for nineteen Emmy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, six Satellite Awards and fifty-seven other awards, with wins including the 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series  Musical or Comedy, and Emmy awards for Jane Lynch, guest-star Neil Patrick Harris and Murphy's direction of the pilot episode. In 2011, the show once again won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series  Musical or Comedy. Jane Lynch and Chris Colfer won Golden Globes for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor respectively; Matthew Morrison and Lea Michele also received nominations for Best Actor and Best Actress respectively. The show was also chosen by Fox to fill the coveted timeslot that followed the network's coverage of Super Bowl XLV in 2011. Glee was nominated for twelve Primetime Emmys for its second season in July 2011, and it received three Emmy nominations for its third season a year later.Ian Brennan conceived Glee based on his own experience as a member of the Prospect High School show choir in Mount Prospect, Illinois.[1] He initially envisioned Glee as a film, rather than a television series, and wrote the first draft in August 2005 with the aid of Screenwriting for Dummies.[1] He completed the script in 2005, but could not generate interest in the project for several years.[2] Mike Novick, a television producer and a friend of Brennan's from Los Angeles, was a member of the same gym as Ryan Murphy, and gave him a copy of Brennan's script.[3] Murphy had been in a show choir in college, and felt he could relate to the script. Murphy and his Nip/Tuck colleague Brad Falchuk suggested that Glee be produced as a television show. The script was entirely rewritten,[2] and was picked up by Fox within fifteen hours of being received. Murphy attributed that, in part, to the network's success with American Idol. "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein", he said.[4] Murphy and Falchuk became the show's executive producers and showrunners, Brennan became a co-executive producer and Novick a producer.[4] Brennan, Falchuk and Murphy started by writing "all the episodes".[5]Glee is set at the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio.[6] Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself grew up in Indiana, and recalled childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park.[7] Although set in Lima, the show is filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood.[8] Murphy has said that he has never seen a High School Musical film, to which Glee has been compared, and that his interest lay in creating a "postmodern musical," rather than "doing a show where people burst into song," drawing more heavily on the format of Chicago.[9] Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism. "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why Idol worked. It's pure escapism," he said.[4] Murphy intended to make a family show to appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads,[4] and as of October 2009 he had already mapped out plans for the series covering three years of broadcast.[10]The three co-creatorsMurphy, Falchuk, and Brennanplan the stories together. For the first two seasons, they were the only writers, and after taking joint credit for the pilot episode and the episode that opened the fall 2009 season, they began rotating taking a single auctorial credit, based in large part on the person "whos taken the lead in story breaking or who wrote a draft". Brennan noted that the writing process is "fast and loose, with the emphasis on fast", and quotes Murphy as having said, in terms of their roles in episode creation, "I'm sort of the brain. Brad's sort of the heart. Ian's sort of the funny bone", which Brennan says "is true in a lot of ways". Some of the characters are written more by one writer than by the others. Brennan writes most of Sue's material, and Falchuk frequently writes the scenes between Kurt and Burt Hummel, though Murphy contributes a great deal to Kurt.[11]Starting with season three, a writing staff of six was hired: Ali Adler, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Marti Noxon, Michael Hitchcock, Matt Hodgson and Ross Maxwell.[12] The season's fourth episode, "Pot o' Gold", was written by Adler, the first not credited to the show's three creators.[13][14]The series features numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters.[15] Ryan Murphy is responsible for selecting all of the songs used, and has said that he strives to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very importantthe balancing of that."[3] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along."[16] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that "there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told him a couple of things that have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or hell ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I dont think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us."[17] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 1849 demographic.[18]Murphy was surprised at the ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached, and explained: "I think the key to it is they loved the tone of it. They loved that this show was about optimism and young kids, for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience."[15] A minority of those approached refused to allow their music to be used, including Bryan Adams, Guns N' Roses and Coldplay; however, in June 2010, Coldplay reversed their decision, allowing Glee the rights to their catalog.[19] Adams posted on his Twitter account that the producers of Glee had never requested permission from him and urged them to "pick up the phone".[20] Composer and musician Billy Joel offered many of his songs for use on the show,[21] and other artists have offered use of their songs for free.[22] A series of Glee soundtrack albums have been released through Columbia Records. Songs featured on the show are available for digital download through iTunes up to two weeks before new episodes air, and through other digital outlets and mobile carriers a week later.[10] Glee music producer Adam Anders has begun to add original music to the show, including two original songs, "Loser Like Me" and "Get It Right", on the March15, 2011 episode.[23]Glee is choreographed by Zach Woodlee and features four to eight production numbers per episode.[24] Once Murphy selects a song, rights are cleared with its publishers by music supervisor P. J. Bloom, and music producer Adam Anders rearranges it for the Glee cast.[10] Numbers are pre-recorded by the cast, while Woodlee constructs the accompanying dance moves, which are then taught to the cast and filmed.[3] Studio recordings of tracks are then made. The process begins six to eight weeks before each episode is filmed, and can end as late as the day before filming begins.[10] Each episode costs at least $3million to produce,[3] and can take up to ten days to film as a result of the elaborate choreography.[9] In late 2010, Bloom reported the process has been even shorter; "as quick as a few weeks".[18] For the second season, the creators were offered listens of upcoming songs in advance by publishers and record labels, with production occurring even before song rights are cleared.[18]Prior to the premiere of the second episode, the cast of Glee went on tour at several Hot Topic stores across the nation.[25] The cast sang the U.S. national anthem at the third game of the 2009 World Series.[26] They were invited by Macy's to perform at the 2009 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, but host broadcaster NBC rejected the plan due to Glee airing on a rival network.[27] Murphy commented on the cast's exclusion: "I completely understand NBC's position, and look forward to seeing a Jay Leno float."[28]Due to the success of the show, the cast went on a concert tour following the first season wrap upGlee Live! In Concert!visiting Phoenix, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York.[29] In addition, the cast recorded a cover of Wham!'s "Last Christmas", which was released as a single in late 2009, but didn't appear in the show until "A Very Glee Christmas" on December10, 2010.[10] Morrison, Lynch, Michele, Monteith and Colfer reprised their roles as Will, Sue, Rachel, Finn and Kurt respectively for a cameo appearance in an episode of The Cleveland Show that aired January16, 2011.[30] Michele, Monteith and Riley appeared as campers in the twenty-second season premiere of The Simpsons.[31]Lynch, Colfer, Monteith and Riley appeared at the 2010 MTV VMAs on September12, 2010.[32] When Agron, Michele and Monteith posed for a set of risqu photos for the November 2010 edition of GQ magazine, the show was criticized by the Parents Television Council (PTC). PTC president Tim Winter commented that Glee has many young fans, and that "by authorizing this kind of near-pornographic display, the creators of the program have established their intentions on the shows direction. And it isn't good for families."[33]The promotional posters for the first season have the stars of the show using their right hands to make an "L" to fill in the L of the word Glee.

The promotional posters for the third season have the stars of the show getting dodgeballs thrown at them by Sue Sylvester. While the cast concert tour, Glee Live! In Concert!, began on May15, 2010, and presented concerts in four cities in the US for the remainder of the month, the second edition, with an almost entirely new set list, toured for four weeks in the US and Canada from May21 through June18, 2011, and followed that with twelve days in England and Ireland, from June22 through July3, 2011.[34] The cast also performed on the seventh season of The X Factor on December5, 2010.[35]In casting Glee, Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza; Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening; and Jenna Ushkowitz, who had been in the Broadway revival of The King and I.[36]Actors with no theatrical experience who auditioned were required to prove they could sing and dance as well as act. Chris Colfer had no previous professional experience, but Murphy wrote in the character Kurt Hummel for him to play.[36] Jayma Mays auditioned with the song "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me" from The Rocky Horror Show, while Cory Monteith initially submitted a tape of himself acting only, and was requested to submit a second, musical tape, in which he sang "a cheesy, '80s music-video-style version" of REO Speedwagon's "Can't Fight This Feeling".[36] Kevin McHale came from a boy-band background, having previously been part of the group Not Like Them. He explained that the diversity of the cast's backgrounds reflects the range of different musical styles within the show itself: "It's a mix of everything: classic rock, current stuff, R&B. Even the musical theatre stuff is switched up. You won't always recognize it."[36] Jane Lynch was originally supposed to have a recurring role in the show,[37] but was made a series regular when a Damon Wayans pilot she was working on for ABC fell through.[38] The cast is contracted for a potential three Glee films,[39] with their contract stating that "[The actor] hereby grants Fox three exclusive, irrevocable options to engage [the actor] in up to, respectively, three feature length motion pictures."[40] Murphy said in December 2010 that he wasn't interested in doing a Glee movie "as a story", and added, "I might do it as a live concert thing."[41] Glee: The 3D Concert Movie, filmed during the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour, was released on August 12, 2011.[42]Glee features fifteen main roles with star billing. Morrison plays Will Schuester, McKinley High's Spanish teacher, who becomes director of the glee club, hoping to restore it to its former glory.[24] Lynch plays Sue Sylvester, head coach of the "Cheerios" cheerleading squad, and the Glee Club's arch-nemesis.[38] Mays appears as Emma Pillsbury, the school's mysophobic guidance counselor who has feelings for Will,[43] and Jessalyn Gilsig plays Terri Schuester, Will's wife whom he eventually divorces after five years of marriagethey separate when he discovers she has faked being pregnant instead of revealing she had suffered a false pregnancy.[44] Michele plays Rachel Berry, talented star of the glee club who is often bullied by the Cheerios and football players, but grows closer to them as the show progresses. Rachel has an on and off relationship with Finn Hudson starting in season one, and the two become engaged in season three.[44] Monteith plays Finn, star quarterback of the school's football team who risks alienation by his friends after joining the glee club.[44] Also in the club are Amber Riley as Mercedes Jones, a fashion-conscious diva who initially resents having to sing back-up; Colfer as Kurt Hummel, a fashionable gay male countertenor;[45] McHale as Artie Abrams, a guitar player and paraplegic; and Ushkowitz as Tina Cohen-Chang, an Asian American student with a fake speech impediment. Dianna Agron plays Quinn Fabray, Finn's cheerleader girlfriend, who later joins the glee club to keep an eye on him. Mark Salling plays Noah "Puck" Puckerman, a good friend of Finn's on the football team who at first disapproves of Finn joining the glee club, but later joins the glee club himself. Naya Rivera and Heather Morris, who portray Cheerios and glee club vocalists Santana Lopez and Brittany Pierce respectively, were originally recurring actors, but starting in the second season were promoted to series regulars.[46] Mike O'Malley, who plays Kurt's father Burt Hummel, also became a series regular on season two.[47] Gilsig and O'Malley no longer appear on the list of starring actors at the beginning of the third season, though O'Malley will be appearing as a recurring guest star in at least six episodes during the season.[48] Two actors were promoted to series regulars as of the third season: Harry Shum, Jr. as football player and glee club member Mike Chang and Darren Criss as former Dalton Academy Warbler and new club member Blaine Anderson, both of whom started as recurring actors, Shum in the first season and Criss in the second.[49]Murphy has stated that many of the original characters will graduate from McKinley High at the end of the third season. "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience."[50] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch will remain to provide continuity to the series,[51] though according to Falchuk, some studentsRachel, Finn and Kurt in particularwill likely remain on the show after they graduate.[52] In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show  they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [tweet,] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." He then continued: "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes."[53]The first season of Glee consists of twenty-two episodes.[54] The pilot episode was originally broadcast on May 19, 2009.[55] The series returned on September 9, 2009,[56] airing an additional twelve episodes on Wednesdays in the 9:00pm timeslot until December 9, 2009, for a total of thirteen episodes. On September 21, 2009, nine more episodes were ordered for the first season by Fox,[57] and the first of these episodes was broadcast on April 13, 2010. These episodes aired on Tuesday evenings at 9:00pm.[58] On January11, 2010, it was announced that Fox had commissioned a second season of the show. The second season began production in June 2010.[59][60] Season two began on September 21, 2010,[61] airing in the 8:00pm time slot on Tuesdays, and consists of twenty-two episodes. The show was chosen by Fox to fill the coveted timeslot that followed the network's coverage of Super Bowl XLV in 2011,[62] and the network originally planned to move the show to the 9:00pm time slot on Wednesdays following the postSuper Bowl broadcast.[63] However, Fox later revised its schedule, leaving Glee on Tuesdays in order to concentrate on building up its weaker Wednesday and Thursday line-ups.[64] A third season was ordered by Fox on May23, 2010, before the end of the first season. The early renewal of the show allowed the production team to cut costs and to plan ahead when writing scripts.[65] The third season broadcasts remained in the show's Tuesday 8:00pm time slot, and began airing on September 20, 2011.[66][67] Fox has announced that the show's fourth season will change date and time of broadcast: it will be moving to Thursdays in the 9:00pm time slot, airing after that evening's 8:00pm music competition "results" showsThe X Factor in the fall and American Idol in midseason.[68]Glee has been syndicated for broadcast in many countries worldwide, including Australia, where cast members visited to promote the show prior to its September 2009 debut on Network Ten.[69] It also airs in Canada,[70] New Zealand,[71] Israel[72][73] and Fiji.[74] It is broadcast in South Africa, where Fox beams the episodes directly to the M-Net broadcast center in Johannesburg rather than delivering the tapes.[75] In addition, it airs in the United Kingdom,[76] where E4 broadcast the first two seasons, showing episodes months after they were first aired in the US. Sky1 broadcast the series starting with the third season, airing episodes two days after their US broadcast.[77] The series also airs in Italya week later than the US broadcast, and dubbed into Italianand in Lithuania.[78] In Ireland, most episodes premiere twenty hours after their US broadcast, making it the European Premiere. Episodes in Ireland air on TV3 and its sister channel 3e.[79] Asian countries that broadcast Glee include the Philippines,[80] India,[81] Malaysia,[82] Singapore[83][84] Indonesia and Japan. The show began airing in Brazil (for the first time in a non-cable network) on July2, 2011, on the Rede Globo network.[85] Glee also airs in the Middle East and Persian Gulf via the Fox Series network.[86]Three soundtrack albums were released to accompany Glee's first season: Glee: The Music, Volume 1, Glee: The Music, Volume 2 and Glee: The Music, Volume 3 Showstoppers.[87][88][89] Two extended plays (EP) accompanied the episodes "The Power of Madonna" and "Journey to Regionals": Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna and Glee: The Music, Journey to Regionals respectively.[90][91] Glee: The Music, The Complete Season One, a compilation album featuring all 100 studio recordings from the first season, was released exclusively to the iTunes Store.[92] Five soundtrack albums were released to accompany Glee's second season: Glee: The Music, The Christmas Album, featuring Christmas-themed songs, and Glee: The Music, Volume4, were both released in November 2010;[93][94][95] Glee: The Music, Volume5,[96] Glee: The Music Presents the Warblers,[97] and Glee: The Music, Volume6[98] were 2011 releases, in March, April, and May, respectively. An EP entitled Glee: The Music, The Rocky Horror Glee Show was released to accompany the Halloween episode, "The Rocky Horror Glee Show".[99] Two EPs were released exclusively at the Target discount chain: Glee: The Music, Love Songs in the last week of 2010, and Glee: The Music, Dance Party in early September 2011.[100][101]Glee has been released on several DVD and Blu-ray box-sets. Glee Pilot Episode: Director's Cut features the pilot episode and a preview of the second episode, "Showmance".[102] Glee Volume 1: Road to Sectionals contains the first thirteen episodes of season one,[103] and Glee Volume 2: Road to Regionals contains the final nine episodes of the first season.[104] Glee  The Complete First Season was released on September 13, 2010.[105] Three boxed sets were released for the second season: Glee Season 2: Volume 1 containing the first ten episodes on January 25, 2011,[106] and both Glee Season 2: Volume 2 with the final twelve episode and Glee: The Complete Second Season with all twenty-two on September 13, 2011.[107] All three were released on DVD; only the complete season is available on Blu-ray.Little, Brown Books is in the process of publishing five Gleerelated young adult novels, which are being developed in collaboration with the show's producers and writers.[108] The first three novels have been written by Sophia Lowell; the first, Glee: The Beginning, was released in August 2010 and serves as a prequel to the events of the television series.[109] Subsequent novels include Glee: Foreign Exchange, released in February 2011,[110] and Glee: Summer Break, released in July 2011.[111] Separate to the young adult series, it was planned that Sue Sylvester would write her autobiography in the second season; Murphy also planned for it to be released as a real book, with Lynch going on an accompanying book tour in character as Sue.[112][113] The book was not mentioned on the program during the second season, nor has it been scheduled for publication.Twentieth Century Fox Consumer Products have plans for a line of Gleerelated merchandise including games, electrical products, greeting cards, apparel and stationery.[114] Macy's carry a line of Gleerelated clothing, and Claire's stock accessories.[115]Glee received a Metacritic score of 77 out of 100 in its first season, based on reviews by eighteen critics.[116] It was praised by critics in several round-up reviews of 2009 in television. James Poniewozik of Time ranked it the eighth best television show of the year, commenting: "when Glee workswhich is oftenit is transcendent, tear-jerking and thrilling like nothing else on TV."[117] Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker ranked it ninth, calling it "Hands down the year's most novel show [and] also its least likely success",[118] Lisa Respers France of CNN wrote that while ordinarily Glee's premise would have been "a recipe for disaster", the show has "such quirky charm and bravado that it is impossible not to get swept up".[119]Nancy Gibbs of Time magazine wrote that she had heard the series described as "anti-Christian" by a youth minister, and commented:It is easy to see his point, if you look at the specifics. [...] The students lie, they cheat, they steal, they lust, they lace the bake-sale cupcakes with pot in order to give the student body a severe case of the munchies. Nearly all the Ten Commandments get violated at one point or another, while the audience is invited to laugh at people's pain and folly and humiliation. ... It insults kids to suggest that simply watching Characters Behaving Badly onscreen means they'll take that as permission to do the same themselves. [...] And it's set in high school, meaning it's about a journey not just to college and career but to identity and conviction, the price of popularity, the compromises we must make between what we want and what we need."[120]Variety's Brian Lowry was critical of the show's early episodes, highlighting acting and characterization issues and deeming the adult cast "over-the-top buffoons", with the exception of Mays' Emma, who he felt offered "modest redemption".[121] Though he praised Colfer and Michele's performances, Lowry wrote that the show's talent was squandered by its "jokey, cartoonish, wildly uneven tone", deeming the series a "one-hit wonder".[122] Following the show's mid-season finale, Lowry wrote that while Glee "remains a frustrating mess at times", its "vibrant musical numbers and talented cast have consistently kept it on [his] TiVo must list" conceding that "even with its flaws, TV would be poorer without Glee."[123]As Glee's initial success pulled in a large audience, John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that the early shows "felt fresh, mainly because the motley crew of kids had a kind of square navet." Doyle notes that the early success took Glee away from its original characters and plot, focusing more on celebrity guests. "The gaiety is gone from Glee. You should have set it in its prime, mere months ago".[124]The show's musical performances have been a commercial success, with over thirty-six million copies of Glee cast single releases purchased digitally, and over eleven million albums purchased worldwide through October 2011.[125] In 2009, the Glee cast had twenty-five singles chart on the Billboard Hot 100, the most by any artist since The Beatles had thirty-one songs in the chart in 1964;[126] in 2010, it placed eighty singles on the Billboard Hot 100, far outstripping the previous record.[127] In February 2011, Glee surpassed Elvis Presley as the act with the most songs placed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, though fewer than one-fourth of them have charted for more than one week.[128] The cast performance of "Don't Stop Believin'" was certified gold on October 13, 2009, achieving over 500,000 digital sales,[129] and on March 16, 2011, received platinum certification for having sales of over a million.[130] The series' cover version had a positive effect on sales of Rihanna's "Take a Bow", which increased by 189percent after the song was covered in the Glee episode "Showmance".[129]However, there has also been critical condemnation of the cast performances. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone commented that Matthew Morrison "couldn't rap his way out of a 98 rehearsal", and Allmusic's Andrew Leahey wrote that Cory Monteith and Dianna Agron "can't sing nearly as well as their co-stars".[131] E! Online's Joal Ryan criticized the show for its "overproduced soundtrack" and complained that many songs rely too heavily on the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune: "For every too-brief moment of Lea Michele sounding rawand lovelyon a "What a Girl Wants", or Monteith singing a perfectly credible REO Speedwagon in the shower, there's Michele and Monteith sounding like 1990s-era Cher on "No Air", or Monteith sounding like the Monteith XRZ-200 on the out-of-the-shower version of "Can't Fight This Feeling".[132]During the second season, Rob Sheffield for Rolling Stone noted the Britney Spears and Rocky Horror tribute episodes as examples when he lauded Glee and its choice of music. He praised Murphy for his selection and resurrection of "forgotten" pop songs and compared the show's uniqueness to "MTV in its prime" as the embodiment of popular culture.[133]Some artists, including Slash, Kings of Leon and Foo Fighters, have declined to have their songs used on the show. Murphy has been publicly critical of these refusals, which has led to exchanges in the press between him and a number of artists.[134]Fans of Glee are commonly referred to as "gleeks",[135] a portmanteau of "glee" and "geek". Fox ran a "Biggest GLEEK" competition, measuring fans' Glee-related activity on social networking websites such as Facebook and MySpace, and found that the growth of the fanbase outpaced the network's science-fiction shows.[136] The cast's Hot Topic tour was titled "The Gleek Tour".[25] Glee is one of the most tweeted-about TV shows.[137] In 2011, it was the top trending US TV show.[138] On IMDb, Glee is the seventh highest ranking TV series of the period 20022012.[139] Fans have recreated many of its musical numbers in tribute to the show, sharing them on YouTube. Based on this trend, show producers included instrumental versions of some songs on the show's soundtracks.[137]Similarly, Glee fans have created portmanteaus of character couples, such as "Finchel" for Finn and Rachel, "Klaine" for Kurt and Blaine, and "Brittana" for Brittany and Santana. This fact has been referenced in various second season episodes, notably "Furt", which is itself a coinage for the new stepbrothers Finn and Kurt, and "Rumours".[140][141]Glee has received a number of awards and nominations. In 2009, the series won five Satellite Awards: "Best Musical or Comedy TV Series", "Best Actor" and "Actress in a Musical or Comedy TV Series" for Morrison and Michele, "Best Supporting Actress" for Lynch and "Special Achievement for Outstanding Guest Star" for Kristin Chenoweth.[142] In 2010, the show won a Golden Globe Award for "Best Television Series  Musical or Comedy". Morrison, Michele and Lynch also received acting nominations.[143] The series was nominated for two Writers Guild of America Awards, with screenplays nominated in the "Comedy Series" and "New Series" categories.[144] The Glee cast won the "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" award at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards.[145] Paris Barclay and Ryan Murphy both received nominations for "Outstanding Directing Comedy Series" at the Directors Guild of America Awards for their work on Glee.[146] In July 2010, Glee received nineteen Emmy Award nominations, including "Outstanding Comedy Series", "Outstanding Lead Actor Comedy Series" for Morrison and "Outstanding Lead Actress Comedy Series" for Michele; it won four of these, including "Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series" for Lynch and "Outstanding Guest Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series" for Neil Patrick Harris.[147]In January16, 2011 the show won a Golden Globe for "Best Television Series  Musical or Comedy" and both Lynch and Colfer won Golden Globes for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series, Miniseries, or TV Film.[148] In July 2011, Glee received twelve Emmy nominations and won two: Gwyneth Paltrow was named Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her portrayal of Holly Holliday, and the show won the Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series category.[147] It received three Emmy nominations in July 2012.[147]The cast was invited to sing at the White House at the behest of Michelle Obama in April 2010 for the annual Easter Egg Roll.[149]The pilot episode of Glee averaged 9.62million viewers,[165] and the following eleven episodes attained between 6.10 and 7.65million.[166][167] The mid-season finale was watched by 8.13million viewers,[168] with the show returning in April 2010 to a season high of 13.66million viewers.[169] The following six episodes attained between 11.49 and 12.98million viewers,[170][171] falling to 8.99million for the penultimate episode "Funk".[172] Viewing figures rose to 11.07million viewers for the season finale,[173] giving Glee the highest finale rating for a new show in the 200910 television season.[174] Only the first twenty episodes of the first season were accounted for when calculating the season average due to the final two episodes airing outside the traditional sweeps period.[175] On February 6, 2011, after the Super Bowl, Glee received its highest ever ratings, with over 26.8million tuning in to see the special episode, with a peak of 39.5million.[176]Glee: The 3D Concert Movie, a concert film based on the four-week North American segment of the 2011 Glee Live! In Concert! tour and featuring the student cast of the series in performance and backstage, was released in the United States on August12, 2011, for a two-week limited engagement. The film is directed by Kevin Tancharoen.[42]In January 2010, it was announced that open auditions would be held for three new roles to be introduced in Glee's second season. They were open to amateurs and professionals aged sixteen to twenty-six, and were intended to be the subject of a multi-part television special, set to air in the lead-in to the second season premiere in fall 2010, with the new cast members revealed in the first episode.[59] Murphy commented: "Anybody and everybody now has a chance to be on a show about talented underdogs. We want to be the first interactive musical comedy on television."[177] On June 22, 2010, Josef Adalian of New York magazine revealed that the reality show would not go ahead, due to Murphy's desire to concentrate on the main series, and fear that the distraction of the reality show may damage Glee. Adalian reported that the production team would still choose several winners from the entrants and invite them to appear on Glee for at least one episode.[178] In June 2010, it was announced that Oxygen would host a reality series set to air in June 2011, featuring performers competing for a spot on Glee.[179][180] The Glee Project started airing on June 12, 2011, and the final episode was broadcast on August 21, 2011.[181] The winning prize was a seven-episode guest-starring role in Glee's third season, which was awarded to two contestants, with a two-episode role given to two other finalists.[182]On June 7, 2010, UK broadcaster Channel 4 aired Gleeful: The Real Show Choirs of America on its E4 station. The documentary explored the American show choir phenomenon which inspired Glee.[183] Narrated by Nick Grimshaw,[184] it went behind the scenes with real-life glee clubs and detailed celebrity show choir alumni including Lance Bass, Ashton Kutcher, Blake Lively and Anne Hathaway.[185] It was selected as recommended viewing by The Guardian, with the comment: "it's a fascinating look at the real-life New Directions, and it's equally as crackers as its TV champion."[186] The newspaper's Lucy Mangan reviewed the documentary positively, writing: "It will, one way or another, fill your heart to bursting", and commenting that: "Glee, it turns out, is not a gloriously ridiculous, highly polished piece of escapism. It is cinma vrit."[187] It was watched by 411,000 viewers, a 2.3% audience share.[188]In summer 2010, Channel 5 in the United Kingdom aired Don't Stop Believing, a reality talent show inspired by Glee's success. The series featured live shows in which established and new musical performance groups competed against each other, performing well-known songs in new arrangements, with viewers voting on the winner.[189] Solo singers were also sought to join a group to represent the United Kingdom on the American glee club circuit.[190][191] Five's controller Richard Woolfe stated: "There's an explosion in musical performance groups and Don't Stop Believing will tap into that exciting groundswell."[192] The show was hosted by Emma Bunton,[193] who told The Belfast Telegraph that she is a "huge fan" of Glee.[194] The show's judges were former EastEnders actress Tamsin Outhwaite, Blue member Duncan James, singer Anastacia and High School Musical choreographer Charles "Chucky" Klapow.[195]Glee at TV.comRyan MurphyBrad FalchukIan BrennanDianna AgronChris ColferDarren CrissJessalyn GilsigJane LynchJayma MaysKevin McHaleLea MicheleCory MonteithHeather MorrisMatthew MorrisonMike O'MalleyChord OverstreetAmber RileyNaya RiveraMark SallingHarry Shum, Jr.Jenna UshkowitzRyan MurphyBrad FalchukDante Di LoretoIan BrennanAlexis Martin WoodallMichael NovickKenneth SilversteinRobert Del ValleRoberto Aguirre-SacasaJoe LeonardBradley BueckerDoc CrotzerJohn L.

The show's main character is Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), a drug-addicted, unconventional, misanthropic medical genius who leads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional PrincetonPlainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The shows premise originated with Paul Attanasio, while David Shore, who is credited as creator, was primarily responsible for the conception of the title character. The shows executive producers include Shore, Attanasio, Attanasios business partner Katie Jacobs, and film director Bryan Singer. It was largely filmed in Century City.House often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patients illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights. His flouting of hospital rules and procedures frequently leads him into conflict with his boss, hospital administrator and Dean of Medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). Houses only true friend is Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), head of the Department of Oncology. During the first three seasons, Houses diagnostic team consists of Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). At the end of the third season, this team disbands. Rejoined by Foreman, House gradually selects three new team members: Dr. Remy Thirteen Hadley (Olivia Wilde), Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), and Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn). Kutner makes his final appearance late in season five. Chase and Cameron continue to appear in different roles at the hospital until early in season six. Cameron then departs the hospital, and Chase returns to the diagnostic team. Thirteen takes a leave of absence for most of season seven, and her position is filled by medical student Martha M. Masters (Amber Tamblyn). Cuddy and Masters depart before season eight; Foreman becomes the new dean of medicine, while Dr. Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) and Dr. Chi Park (Charlyne Yi) join Houses team.Critically acclaimed for the first half of its run, House was among the top-ten rated shows in the United States from its second through its fourth season. Distributed to 66 countries, House was the most watched television program in the world in 2008.[1] The show received numerous awards, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Peabody Award, and nine People's Choice Awards. On February 8, 2012, Fox announced that the eighth season, then in progress, would be Houses last.[2] The series finale aired on May 21, 2012, following an hour-long retrospective.In 2004, David Shore and Paul Attanasio, along with Attanasio's business partner Katie Jacobs, pitched the show (untitled at the time) to Fox as a CSI-style medical detective program,[3] a hospital whodunit in which the doctors investigated symptoms and their causes.[4] Attanasio was inspired to develop a medical procedural drama by The New York Times Magazine column "Diagnosis", written by physician Lisa Sanders, who is an attending physician at Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH), and Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) is modeled after this teaching institution.[5] Fox bought the series, though the network's then-president, Gail Berman, told the creative team, "I want a medical show, but I don't want to see white coats going down the hallway".[6] Jacobs has said that this stipulation was one of the many influences that led to the show's ultimate form.[6]We knew the network was looking for procedurals, and Paul [Attanasio] came up with this medical idea that was like a cop procedural. The suspects were the germs. I mean, germs don't have motives.After Fox picked up the show, it acquired the working title Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain[8] ("zebra" is medical slang for an unusual or obscure diagnosis, while "circling the drain" refers to terminal cases, patients in an irreversible decline).[9] The original premise of the show was of a team of doctors working together trying to "diagnose the undiagnosable".[10] Shore felt it was important to have an interesting central character, one who could examine patients' personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies.[10] As Shore and the rest of the creative team explored the character's possibilities, the program concept became less of a procedural and more focused upon the lead role.[11] The character was named "House", which was adopted as the show's title as well.[8] Shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the pilot episode.[3] Bryan Singer, who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles, has said that the "title of the pilot was 'Everybody Lies', and that's the premise of the show".[11] Shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of Berton Rouech, a staff writer for The New Yorker between 1944 and 1994, who specialized in features about unusual medical cases.[4]Shore traced the concept for the title character to his experience as a patient at a teaching hospital.[12] Shore recalled: "I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [for my cluelessness] and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room."[13] A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way.[14] The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox rejected this. Jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network's insistence that the character be reimaginedputting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension.[11] The writers ultimately chose to give House a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis, which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency.[14]Similarities between Gregory House and the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle appear throughout the series.[15][16] Shore explained that he was always a Holmes fan and found the character's indifference to his clients unique.[13] The resemblance is evident in House's reliance on deductive reasoning[15] and psychology, even where it might not seem obviously applicable,[9] and his reluctance to accept cases he finds uninteresting.[17] His investigatory method is to eliminate diagnoses logically as they are proved impossible; Holmes used a similar method.[8] Both characters play instruments (House plays the piano, the guitar, and the harmonica; Holmes, the violin) and take drugs (House is addicted to Vicodin; Holmes uses cocaine recreationally).[15] House's relationship with Dr. James Wilson echoes that between Holmes and his confidant, Dr. John Watson.[8] Robert Sean Leonard, who portrays Wilson, said that House and his characterwhose name is very similar to Watson'swere originally intended to work together much as Holmes and Watson do; in his view, House's diagnostic team has assumed that aspect of the Watson role.[18] Shore said that House's name itself is meant as "a subtle homage" to Holmes.[8][19] House's building number is 221B, a direct reference to Holmes's street address.[9]Individual episodes of the series contain additional references to the Sherlock Holmes tales. The main patient in the pilot episode is named Rebecca Adler after Irene Adler, a character in the first Holmes short story, "A Scandal in Bohemia".[20] In the season two finale, House is shot by a crazed gunman credited as "Moriarty," the name of Holmes's nemesis.[21] In the season four episode "It's a Wonderful Lie," House receives a "second edition Conan Doyle" as a Christmas gift.[22] In the season five episode "The Itch," House is seen picking up his keys and Vicodin from the top of a copy of Conan Doyle's The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes.[23] In another season five episode, "Joy to the World," House, in an attempt to fool his team, uses a book by Joseph Bell, Conan Doyle's inspiration for Sherlock Holmes.[8] The volume had been given to him the previous Christmas by Wilson, who included the message "Greg, made me think of you." Before acknowledging that he gave the book to House, Wilson tells two of the team members that its source was a patient, Irene Adler.[24] The series finale pays homage to Holmes's apparent death in "The Final Problem", the 1893 story with which Conan Doyle originally intended to conclude the Holmes chronicles.[25]House is a co-production of Heel and Toe Films, Shore Z Productions, and Bad Hat Harry Productions in association with Universal Media Studios for Fox.[27] Paul Attanasio and Katie Jacobs, the heads of Heel and Toe Films; David Shore, the head of Shore Z Productions; and Bryan Singer, the head of Bad Hat Harry Productions, have been executive producers of the program since its inception.[12] Lawrence Kaplow, Peter Blake, and Thomas L. Moran joined the staff as writers at the beginning of the first season after the making of the pilot episode. Writers Doris Egan, Sara Hess, Russel Friend, and Garrett Lerner joined the team at the start of season two. Friend and Lerner, who are business partners, had been offered positions when the series launched, but turned the opportunity down. After observing the show's success, they accepted when Jacobs offered them jobs again the following year.[28] Writers Eli Attie and Sean Whitesell joined the show at the start of season four. Since the beginning of season four, Moran, Friend, and Lerner have been credited as executive producers on the series, joining Attanasio, Jacobs, Shore, and Singer.[27] Hugh Laurie was credited as an executive producer for the second[29] and third[30] episodes of season five.Shore is House's showrunner.[31] Through the end of the sixth season, more than two dozen writers have contributed to the program. The most prolific have been Kaplow (18 episodes), Blake (17), Shore (16), Friend (16), Lerner (16), Moran (14), and Egan (13). The show's most prolific directors through its first six seasons were Deran Sarafian (22 episodes), who was not involved in season six, and Greg Yaitanes (17). Of the more than three dozen other directors who have worked on the series, only David Straiton directed as many as 10 episodes through the sixth season. Hugh Laurie directed the seventeenth episode of season six, "Lockdown".[32] Elan Soltes has been the visual effects supervisor since the show began.[33] Lisa Sanders, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, is a technical advisor to the series. She writes the "Diagnosis" column that inspired House's premise.[34] According to Shore, "three different doctors... check everything we do".[35] Bobbin Bergstrom, a registered nurse, is the program's on-set medical adviser.[35]It wasn't a massive move when I first considered [doing House]. What usually happens is you do a pilot and of the very few picked up, only about a quarter go to a second year. So I thought I'll have three fun weeks. I never dreamed I'd be here three and a half years later.At first, the producers were looking for a "quintessentially American person" to play the role of House.[37] Bryan Singer in particular felt there was no way he was going to hire a non-American actor for the role.[10] At the time of the casting session, actor Hugh Laurie was in Namibia filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix. He assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light,[37] and apologized for its appearance[38] (which Singer compared to a "bin Laden video").[39] Laurie improvised, using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the "American actor" was able to grasp the character.[10][40] Singer was not aware that Laurie was English, due to his convincing American accent. Laurie credits the accent to "a misspent youth [watching] too much TV and too many movies".[37] Although locally better-known actors such as Denis Leary, David Cross, Rob Morrow, and Patrick Dempsey were considered for the part, Shore, Jacobs, and Attanasio were as impressed as Singer and cast Laurie as House.[41]Laurie later revealed that he initially thought the show's central character was Dr. James Wilson. He assumed that House was a supporting part, due to the nature of the character, until he received the full script of the pilot episode.[42] Laurie, the son of a doctor, Ran Laurie, said he felt guilty for "being paid more to become a fake version of [his] own father".[37] From the start of season three, he was being paid $275,000 to $300,000 per episode, as much as three times what he had previously been making on the series.[43][44] By the show's fifth season, Laurie was earning around $400,000 per episode, making him one of the highest paid actors on network television.[45]Robert Sean Leonard had received the script for the CBS show Numb3rs, as well as that for House.[46] Leonard thought the Numb3rs script was "kind of cool" and planned to audition for the show.[46] However, he decided that the character he was up for, Charlie Eppes, was in too many scenes; he later observed, "The less I work, the happier I am".[46] He believed that his House audition was not particularly good, but that his lengthy friendship with Singer helped win him the part of Dr. Wilson.[46] Singer had enjoyed Lisa Edelstein's portrayal of a prostitute on The West Wing, and sent her a copy of the pilot script.[47] Edelstein was attracted to the quality of the writing and her character's "snappy dialogue" with House, and was cast as Dr. Lisa Cuddy.[47]Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent suggested that he audition for the role of Dr. Robert Chase. Spencer believed the program would be similar in style to General Hospital, but changed his mind after reading the scripts.[48] After he was cast, he persuaded the producers to turn the character into an Australian.[49] Patrick Dempsey also auditioned for the part of Chase; he later became known for his portrayal of Dr. Derek Shepherd on Grey's Anatomy.[50] Omar Epps, who plays Dr. Eric Foreman, was inspired by his earlier portrayal of a troubled intern on the NBC medical drama ER.[51] Jennifer Morrison felt that her audition for the part of Dr. Allison Cameron was a complete disaster.[52] However, before her audition, Singer had watched some of her performances, including on Dawson's Creek, and already wanted to cast her in the role.[52] Morrison left the show when her character was written out in the middle of season six.[53]At the end of season three, House dismisses Chase, while Foreman and Cameron resign.[54] House must then recruit a new diagnostic team, for which he identifies seven finalists. The producers originally planned to recruit two new full-time actors, with Foreman, who returns in season four's fifth episode, bringing the team back up to three members; ultimately, the decision was made to add three new regular cast members.[55] (Along with Epps, actors Morrison and Spencer remained in the cast, as their characters moved on to new assignments.) During production, the show's writers dismissed a single candidate per episode; as a result, said Jacobs, neither the producers nor the cast knew who was going to be hired until the last minute.[56] In the season's ninth episode, House's new team is revealed: Foreman is joined by doctors Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn),[57] Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson),[58] and Remy "Thirteen" Hadley (Olivia Wilde).[59] The candidates rejected by House have not returned to the show, with the exception of the last one cut: Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek), who appeared for the rest of season four as Wilson's girlfriend,[60] and in season five as a hallucination of House's.[61] While Penn and Wilde had higher profiles than the actors who played the other finalists, Jacobs said they went through an identical audition process and stayed with the show based on the writers' interest in their characters.[56] Kutner was written out of the series near the end of season five after Penn took a position in the White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs.[62]The contracts of Edelstein, Epps, and Leonard expired at the end of season seven. As a cost-cutting measure, the three actors were asked to accept reduced salaries. Epps and Leonard came to terms with the producers, but Edelstein did not, and in May 2011 it was announced that she would not be returning for the show's eighth season.[63]House is often filmed using the "walk and talk" filming technique,[6][17] popularized on television by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, Sports Night, and The West Wing.[64] The technique involves the use of tracking shots, showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking.[64] Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because "when you put a scene on the move, it's a... way of creating an urgency and an intensity".[6] She noted the significance of "the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6'2" and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop".[6] Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker described the show's "cool, 'Fantastic Voyage'like special effects of patients' innards. I'll bet you didn't know that when your kidneys shut down they sound like bubble wrap popping."[65] "Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat" of one patient, another critic observed, "but up her nose and inside her brain and leg".[66] Instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery, the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography.[33] Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise, revealing aspects of his character and the story.[6]The pilot episode was filmed in Canada; primary photography for all subsequent episodes has been shot on the Fox lot in Century City.[35] Bryan Singer chose the hospital near his hometown, West Windsor, New Jersey, as the show's fictional setting.[12] Princeton University's Frist Campus Center[a] is the source of the aerial views of PrincetonPlainsboro Teaching Hospital seen in the series.[67] Some filming took place at the University of Southern California for the season three episode "Half-Wit", which guest-starred Dave Matthews and Kurtwood Smith.[68] Part of House's sixth season was filmed at the abandoned Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital, in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, as the fictional Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital.[69]The opening sequence begins with an MRI of a head with an image of the boxed "H" from the logo (the international symbol for hospital) in the foreground. This is then overlaid with an image of Dr. House's face taken from the pilot episode with the show's full title appearing across his face. House's head then fades and the show's title is underlined and has the "M.D." appear next to it, producing the entire logo of the show. This was the full extent of the title sequence in the pilot episode.[70] All subsequent episodes contain a longer sequence including the names of the six featured cast members and creator David Shore. Laurie's name appears first, followed by the names of the five other featured cast members in alphabetical order (Edelstein, Epps, Leonard, Morrison, Spencer, then Shore).[71]After the show's title fades, there is an aerial view of PPTH (actually various Princeton University buildings, primarily Frist Campus Center).[67] This is followed by a series of images accompanying each cast member's name; most are shown next to, or superimposed upon, illustrations of the human anatomy. Laurie's name appears next to a model of a human head with the brain exposed; Edelstein's name appears next to a visual effectsproduced graphic of nerve axons; Epps's name is superimposed upon a rib cage X-ray; Leonard's name appears on a drawing of the two hemispheres of the brain.[71] The producers originally wanted to include an image of a cane and an image of a Vicodin bottle, but Fox objected. Morrison's title card was thus lacking an image; an aerial shot of rowers on Princeton University's Lake Carnegie was finally agreed upon to accompany her name.[72] Spencer's name appears next to an old-fashioned anatomical drawing of a spine. Between the presentations of Spencer's and Shore's names is a scene of House and his three original team members walking down one of the hospital's hallways.[71] Jacobs said that most of the backgrounds have no specific meaning; however, the final imagethe text "created by David Shore" superimposed upon a human neckconnotes that Shore is "the brain of the show".[72] The sequence was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design in 2005.[73] The title sequence continued to credit Spencer and Morrison, even when their characters were reduced to background roles during seasons four and five, and Morrison even after hers was written out. A new opening sequence was introduced in season seven to accommodate the changes in the cast, removing Morrison's name and including Jacobson and Wilde's.[74][75]The series' original opening theme, as heard in the United States, comprises instrumental portions of "Teardrop" by Massive Attack.[76][77] An acoustic version of "Teardrop", with guitar and vocals by Jos Gonzlez, is heard as background music during the season four finale.[78]Anytime you try to summarize a show in one word, you sound like an ass. It's about truth.Gregory House, M.D., often construed as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey.[70] Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a pre-credits scene set outside the hospital, showing events ending with the onset of the patient's symptoms.[17] The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness,[76][80] which often fail until the patient's condition is critical.[76] They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed,[67] and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting.[17] The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices,[dubious  discuss] and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.[3]The team employs the differential diagnosis method,[80] listing possible etiologies on a whiteboard, then eliminating most of them, usually because one of the team (most often House) provides logical reasons for ruling them out.[81] Typically the patient is misdiagnosed at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless;[80] this usually causes further complications, butas the nature of the complications often provides valuable new evidenceeventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly.[17] House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character.[80] Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases.[82]The team face many diagnostic difficulties from patients' concealment of symptoms, circumstances, or personal histories, so House frequently proclaims during the team's deliberations, "The patient is lying", or mutters "Everybody lies"; such an assumption guides House's decisions and diagnoses,[9] and makes the countermeasure of housebreaking a routine procedure. Because many of his hypotheses are based on epiphanies or controversial insights, he often has trouble obtaining permission for medical procedures he considers necessary from his superior, who in all but the final season is hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy.[83] This is especially the case when the proposed procedures involve a high degree of risk or are ethically questionable. There are frequent disagreements between House and his team,[84] especially Dr. Allison Cameron, whose standards of medical ethics are more conservative than those of the other characters.[76]Like all of the hospital's doctors, House is required to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic.[70][85] His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief.[76][86] During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments.[70] However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses.[15] Analogies with some of the simple cases in the clinic often[dubious  discuss] inspire insights that help solve the team's case.[17][87]It's not a show about addiction, but you can't throw something like this into the mix and not expect it to be noticed and commented on. There have been references to the amount of his consumption increasing over time. It's becoming less and less useful a tool for dealing with his pain, and it's something we're going to continue to deal with, continue to explore.A significant plot element is House's use of Vicodin to manage pain, caused by an infarction in his quadriceps muscle five years before the show's first season, which also forces him to use a cane.[89] In the first season; eleventh episode "Detox", House admits he is addicted to Vicodin, but says he does not have a problem because the pills "let me do my job, and they take away my pain".[b] His addiction has led his colleagues, Cuddy and Dr. James Wilson, to encourage him to go to drug rehabilitation several times.[90] When he has no access to Vicodin or experiences unusually intense pain, he occasionally self-medicates with other narcotic analgesics such as morphine,[91] oxycodone,[92] and methadone.[93] House also frequently drinks liquor when he is not on medical duty, and classifies himself as a "big drinker".[94] Toward the end of season five, House begins to hallucinate; after eliminating other possible diagnoses, he and Wilson determine that his Vicodin addiction is the most likely cause.[95] House goes into denial about this for a brief time, but at the close of the season finale, he commits himself to Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital.[96] In the following season's debut episode, House leaves Mayfield with his addiction under control.[97] However, about a year and a half later, in season seven's 15th episode, "Bombshells", House reacts to the news that Cuddy possibly has kidney cancer by taking Vicodin,[98] and his addiction recurs.[99]Throughout House's run, six of the main actors have received star billing. All of them play doctors who work at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey.[70] Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), the title character, heads the Department of Diagnostic Medicine.[106] House describes himself as "a board-certified diagnostician with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology".[107] Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), House's one true friend, is the head of the Department of Oncology.[108] Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), an endocrinologist,[109] is House's boss, as she is the hospital's dean of medicine and chief administrator.[110] House has a complex relationship with Cuddy, and their interactions often involve a high degree of innuendo and sexual tension.[111] In the sixth episode of season five, "Joy", they kiss for the first time.[112] Their physical relationship does not progress any further during the fifth season; in the finale, House believes he and Cuddy had sex, but this is a hallucination brought on by House's Vicodin addiction.[96] In the finale of season six, Cuddy tells House she loves him. They kiss and agree to try being a couple.[113] Throughout season seven, House and Cuddy try to make their relationship work.House's original team of diagnosticians consists of Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), a neurologist; Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), an intensivist; and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), an immunologist.[110] In the season three episode "Family", Foreman announces his resignation, telling House, "I don't want to turn into you".[c] During the season finale, House tells Chase that he has either learned everything he can, or nothing at all, and dismisses him from the team. Cameron, who has developed an affection for Chase, soon resigns.[54] This leaves House without a team for the season four premiere.[114]Under orders from Cuddy to recruit a new team, House considers forty doctors.[94] Season four's early episodes focus on his selection process, structured as a reality TVstyle elimination contest[94] (Jacobs referred to it as a "version of Survivor").[115] House assigns each applicant a number between 1 and 40, and pares them down to seven finalists.[116] He assesses their performance in diagnostic cases, assisted by Foreman, who returns to the department after his dismissal from another hospital for House-like behavior.[116][117][118] While Foreman's return means there are only two open slots, House tricks Cuddy into allowing him to hire three new assistants.[119] He ultimately selects Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), a former plastic surgeon; Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn), a sports medicine specialist; and Dr. Remy "Thirteen" Hadley (Olivia Wilde), an internist (nicknamed for her number in the elimination contest).[119][120] In the season finale, Thirteen discovers she has, as she had long dreaded, Huntington's disease, which is incurable.[78]In the eleventh episode of season five, "Joy to the World", Foreman and Thirteen engage in a passionate kiss.[24] Thirteen is at first reluctant to start a relationship with Foreman, but the two eventually begin dating and are still together at the end of the season.[96] They break up early in season six. In the twentieth episode of season 5, "Simple Explanation", Kutner is found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. Because Kutner left no note, House suspects foul play, though the death is accepted by the other characters as a suicide.[121]In the seventh episode of season two, "Hunting", Cameron and Chase have a one-night stand.[122] In the middle of season three, they initiate a sexual relationship that Cameron insists be casual;[109] when Chase declares that he "wants more", Cameron ends the affair.[123] By the end of the season, however, Cameron recognizes that she has romantic feelings for Chase and they begin a serious relationship.[54] After leaving the diagnostic team, they assume different roles at the PPTH, Cameron as a senior attending physician in the emergency room[d] and Chase as a surgeon.[94] They become engaged in the season five episode "Saviors" (the episode immediately following Kutner's suicide)[61] and are married in the season finale.[124] When Chase rejoins House's team in season six, Cameron leaves her husband and the hospital in "Teamwork", the season's eighth episode.[125] She returns as a guest character in "Lockdown", nine episodes later.[126]Early in season seven, Thirteen takes an unexplained leave of absence. Cuddy orders House to fill her position with another woman,[127] but eventually makes the choice for him: medical student Martha M. Masters (Amber Tamblyn), who makes her first appearance in the season's sixth episode.[128] Thirteen returns in the "The Dig"the season's 18th episode and the show's 150thin which the reason for her absence is revealed: she was in prison for six months for having helped euthanize her brother, who was suffering from advanced Huntington's.[129] While Jacobson and Wilde play central characters (as did Penn), they did not receive star billing until season seven. They were credited as "Also Starring", with their names appearing after the opening sequence.[130] In season seven, Jacobson and Wilde received star billing; new regular cast member Tamblyn did not.[131]The first six seasons of House each included one or more recurring featured characters, who appear in multi-episode story arcs.[132] In season one, Edward Vogler (Chi McBride), the billionaire owner of a pharmaceutical company, appears in five episodes.[133] He donates US$100 million to the PPTH in return for chairing its board.[134] Vogler represented an attempt to introduce a villain, a move urged by Fox. By the time the Vogler episodes began to air, the show had become a hit and the character was soon dropped.[133] Shore said the concept of a villainous boss was not really viable for the series: "It's called House. The audience knows he'll never get fired."[9]Stacy Warner (Sela Ward), House's ex-girlfriend,[135] appears in the final two episodes of the first season, and seven episodes of season two.[9] She wants House to treat her husband, Mark Warner (Currie Graham), whom House diagnoses with acute intermittent porphyria in the season one finale.[135] Stacy and House grow close again, but House eventually tells Stacy to go back to Mark, which devastates her.[136]Michael Tritter (David Morse), a police detective, appears in several season three episodes. He tries to extract an apology from House, who left Tritter in an examination room with a thermometer in his rectum.[137] After House refuses to apologize, Tritter brings him up on charges of unprescribed narcotics possession and forces him to attend rehab. When the case reaches court, Cuddy lies for House and the case is dismissed. The judge reprimands Tritter for pursuing House to excess, and tells House that she thinks he "has better friends than he deserves", referring to Cuddy's 11th-hour testimony on his behalf. House is sentenced to one night in jail for contempt of court and finishes his rehabilitation under the influence of Vicodin.[90]The candidates for House's new diagnostics team are season four's primary recurring characters.[138] In addition to the three who are chosen, the other four finalists are Jeffrey Cole (Edi Gathegi); Travis Brennan (Andy Comeau), an epidemiologist;[138] Henry Dobson (Carmen Argenziano), a former medical school admissions officer;[94] and Amber "Cut-throat Bitch" Volakis (Anne Dudek), an interventional radiologist.[120] Each of the four departs the show after elimination, except for Volakis, who appears throughout the season, having started a relationship with Wilson.[139][140] In the two-part season finale, Volakis attempts to shepherd a drunken House home when Wilson is unavailable. They are involved in a bus crash, which leads to her death.[78][141] She reappears late in season five among the hallucinations House suffers.[61]Private investigator Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston), a character inspired in part by Shore's love of The Rockford Files, appears in three episodes of season five.[142][143] House initially hires Douglas to spy on Wilson, who has ended their friendship after Volakis's death (the friendship is subsequently rekindled). House later pays Douglas to look into the private lives of his team members and Cuddy.[144] If the character was accepted by the audience, there were plans to feature him as the lead in a spin-off show.[145] In September 2008, Shore spoke to Entertainment Weekly about his vision for the character: "I don't want to do just another medical show. What does excite me in terms of writing is the choices people make and the nature of right and wrong... and a private investigator can approach that question much more readily than a doctor can."[146] There was no show featuring Douglas on the fall 2009 network television schedule.[147] He returns to House in season six as Cuddy's boyfriend.[148] They are briefly engaged until Cuddy breaks it off, realizing that she is in love with House.[149]House received largely positive reviews on its debut;[150] the series was considered a bright spot amid Fox's schedule, largely filled with reality shows.[151] Matt Roush of TV Guide said that the program was an "uncommon cure for the common medical drama".[152] New York Daily News critic David Bianculli applauded the "high caliber of acting and script".[66] The Onion's "A.V. Club" approvingly described it as the "nastiest" black comedy from FOX since 1996's short-lived Profit.[153] New York's John Leonard called the series "medical TV at its most satisfying and basic",[154] while The Boston Globe's Matthew Gilbert appreciated that the show did not sugarcoat the flaws of the characters to assuage viewers' fears about "HMO factories".[155] Variety's Brian Lowry, less impressed, wrote that the show relied on "by-the-numbers storytelling, albeit in a glossy package".[156] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle described it as "mediocre" and unoriginal.[157]General critical reaction to the character of Gregory House was particularly positive.[150][158] Tom Shales of The Washington Post called him "the most electrifying new main character to hit television in years".[159] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Rob Owen found him "fascinatingly unsympathetic".[160] Critics have compared House to fictional detectives Nero Wolfe,[161] Hercule Poirot, and Adrian Monk,[162] and to Perry Cox, a cantankerous doctor on the television show Scrubs.[151][160] One book-length study of the series finds a powerful kinship between House and another famous TV doctor, Hawkeye Pierce of M*A*S*H.[163] Laurie's performance in the role has been widely praised.[76][161][164] The San Francisco Chronicle's Goodman called him "a wonder to behold" and "about the only reason to watch House".[157] Gabrielle Donnelly of the Daily Mail said that because of Laurie's complex personality, he was "perfectly cast" in the title role.[44]Critics have also reacted positively to the show's original supporting cast, which the Post's Shales called a "first-rate ensemble".[159] Leonard's portrayal of Dr. Wilson has been considered Emmy Award worthy by critics with TV Guide, Entertainment Weekly, and USA Today.[165][166] Bianculli of the Daily News was happy to see Edelstein "finally given a deservedly meaty co-starring role".[66] Freelance critic Daniel Fienberg was disappointed that Leonard and Edelstein have not received more recognition for their performances.[167]Reaction to the major shifts of season four was mixed. "With the new crew in place House takes on a slightly more energized feel", wrote Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk. "And the set up for the fifth season is quite brilliant."[168] The Star-Ledger's Alan Sepinwall wrote, "The extended, enormous job audition gave the writers a chance to reinvigorate the show and fully embrace Laurie's comic genius".[132] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times, on the other hand, took issue with the developments: "the cast just kept getting bigger, the stories more scattered and uneven until you had a bunch of great actors forced to stand around watching Hugh Laurie hold the show together by the sheer force of his will".[169] USA Today's Robert Bianco cheered the season finale: "Talk about saving the best for last. With two fabulous, heartbreaking hours... the writers rescued a season that had seemed diffuse, overcrowded and perhaps too ambitious for its own good."[166]In contrast to the acclaim the series had earlier received, season five of House met with relatively poor notices. A. A. Gill of The Sunday Times felt that the show had "lost its sense of humour".[170] The Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan wrote, "House used to be one of the best shows on TV, but it's gone seriously off the rails".[171] Though McNamara of the Los Angeles Times found detective Lucas Douglas a "delightful addition" to the season's early episodes,[169] Ryan saw him as an "unwelcome distraction... an irritating pipsqueak".[143] The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman came in for particular criticism.[132][172]At the end of the show's run, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote that "House had, in its final seasons, become a rather sentimental show".[173] In New York Magazine's blog Vulture, Margaret Lyons wrote, "More than a hospital drama or a character piece or anything else, House is a complex meditation on misery." But, continued Lyons, there is a line between "enlightened cynicism" and "misery-entropy", and "as the show wore on, its dramatic flare dimmed while its agony flare burned ever brighter."[174] Alan Sepinwall wrote, "The repetition and muck of [the] middle seasons ultimately severed whatever emotional connection I had to House's personal struggles."[25]The show placed #62 on Entertainment Weekly's "New TV Classics" list.[175] The show was declared the second highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002-2012).[176]After its first five seasons, House was included in various critics' top ten lists; these are listed below in order of rank.Since its premiere, House has been consistently popular. In its first season, when it ranked twenty-fourth among all television series, House was the ninth most popular primetime program among women.[182] Aided by a lead-in from the widely popular American Idol,[183] the following three seasons of the program each ranked in the top ten among all viewers. House reached its peak Nielsen ratings in its third season, attracting an average of 19.4 million viewers per episode.[184] According to Jacobs, the production team was surprised that the show garnered such a large audience.[185] In its fifth season, the show attracted 12.0 million viewers per episode and slipped to nineteenth place overall. It remained Fox's most popular show other than American Idol.[186]The most-watched episode of House is the season four episode "Frozen",[187] which aired after Super Bowl XLII.[188][189] It attracted slightly more than 29 million viewers.[190] House ranked third for the week, equalling the rating of American Idol and surpassed only by the Super Bowl itself and the post-game show.[191] Below is a table of House's seasonal rankings in the U.S. television market, based on average total viewers per episode. Each U.S. network television season starts in September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.House has redefined the medical television show. No longer a world where an idealized doctor has all the answers or a hospital where gurneys race down the hallways, House's focus is on the pharmacologicaland the intellectual demands of being a doctor. The trial-and-error of new medicine skillfully expands the show beyond the format of a classic procedural, and at the show's heart, a brilliant but flawed physician is doling out the prescriptionsa fitting symbol for modern medicine.House has received many awards and award nominations. In 2005, 2007, and 2008, Laurie was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.[202] The Emmy board also nominated House for Outstanding Drama Series in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, but the show has yet to win the award.[203] For the season one episode "Three Stories", David Shore won a writing Emmy in 2005[73][204] and the Humanitas Prize in 2006.[205] Director Greg Yaitanes received the 2008 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing - Drama Series, for directing "House's Head", the first part of season four's two-episode finale.[206]The show has been nominated for six Golden Globe Awards and received two. Hugh Laurie has been nominated four times for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Drama; he won in 2006[207][208] and again in 2007.[209][210] In 2008 the series received its first nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series - Drama.[211] House was nominated for best dramatic series again the following year, but has yet to win in the category.[212]The show received a 2005 Peabody Award for what the Peabody board called an "unorthodox lead charactera misanthropic diagnostician" and for "cases fit for a medical Sherlock Holmes", which helped make House "the most distinctive new doctor drama in a decade".[213] The American Film Institute (AFI), included House in its 2005 list of 10 Television Programs of the Year.[201]In 2011, House won four People's Choice Awards: favorite TV drama; favorite dramatic actor and actress for Laurie and Edelstein; and favorite TV doctor.[214]Laurie won the Screen Actors Guild's award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series in both 2007 and 2009.[215] Writer Lawrence Kaplow won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2006 for the season two episode "Autopsy".[216] In 2007, the show won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for prosthetic makeup.[217]In 2005, Laurie appeared on the cover of TV Guide as "TV's Sexiest Man".[182] In 2008, Gregory House was voted second sexiest television doctor ever, behind ER's Doug Ross (George Clooney).[44][218]In 2008, House was distributed in a total of 66 countries. With an audience of over 81.8 million worldwide, it was the most watched television show on the globe and far surpassed the viewership figures of the leading TV dramas the previous two years (CSI and CSI: Miami).[219][220] The following year, it placed second in the world after CSI.[221]House episodes premiere on Fox in the United States and Global in Canada, which have identical schedules.[222] The show was the third most popular on Canadian television in 2008.[223] That same year, House was the top-rated television program in Germany,[224] the number 2 show in Italy,[225] and number 3 in the Czech Republic.[226] The series is also very popular in France,[227] Spain,[228] Sweden, and the Netherlands.[229] In the United Kingdom, the first four seasons were broadcast on Five. Sky1 acquired first-run rights beginning with season five.[230] The original, English-language version of the show also airs in Australia on Network Ten,[231] in New Zealand on TV3,[232] and in Ireland on 3e, TV3's cable channel.[233]Episodes of the show are also available online for download: Amazon Video on Demand, iTunes Store and the Zune Marketplace offer episodes from all of seasons 1 through 6, with episodes from the current season (season 7)[citation needed] appearing one week after they air live on television.[234] In 2007, NBC Universal (the show's distributor) and Apple Inc. (iTunes' owner) had a disagreement that temporarily kept the fourth season off iTunes.[235] In a statement to the press, Apple claimed that NBC Universal wanted to drive up the per-episode price to $4.99.[236] In September 2008, it was reported that the issue between Apple and NBC had been resolved.[237] Episodes can now also be purchased in HD on iTunes for $2.99.[238] Recent episodes are available in streaming video on Fox's official House webpage[239] and on Hulu.com.[240]The first seven seasons of the show were released on DVD encoded for regions 1, 2 and 4. A boxed set comprising seasons one through seven has been issued, as well.[241] Universal Studios Home Entertainment announced plans to rerelease the first season in region 1 in anamorphic widescreen (the original release is letterboxed).[242] It is unclear if the DVDs will be re-released with anamorphic widescreen in regions 2 and 4, where they have been presented in 4:3 fullscreen.[243][244]For a charity auction, T-shirts bearing the phrase "Everybody Lies" were sold for a limited time starting on April 23, 2007, on Housecharitytees.com. Proceeds from sales of those shirts and others with the phrase "Normal's Overrated" went to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).[245][246] House cast and crew members also regularly attend fundraisers for NAMI and have featured in ads for the organization that have appeared in Seventeen and Rolling Stone. The show's efforts have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the charity. Jacobs said that through their association with NAMI, they hope to take "some of the stigma off that illness".[247]Nettwerk released the House M.D. Original Television Soundtrack album on September 18, 2007.[248] The soundtrack includes full length versions of songs featured in House and previously unreleased songs especially recorded for the series.[249] In 2008, the Spanish game company Exelweiss designed a cellphone game for the show, which was released in both Spanish and English versions.[250]In June 2009, Legacy Interactive announced a licensing agreement with Universal Pictures Digital Platforms Group (UPDPG) to develop a video game based on the series, in which players step into the roles of House's diagnostic team to deal with five unusual medical cases.[251] The game, released in May 2010, included a minigame calling upon the player to "navigat[e] a restaurant-placemat-style maze, in which a giant sandwich must avoid hungry physicians on its way to Dr. House's office." It received an F from The A.V. Club,[252] however Legacy had updated the game by August 2010.[252]House at TV.com  1 Production

Television.Giant spaceships appear over 29 major cities throughout the world, and Anna (Morena Baccarin), the beautiful and charismatic leader of the extraterrestrial "Visitors", declares that they come in peace. The Visitors claim to only need a small amount of Earth's resources, in exchange for which they will share their advanced technological and medical knowledge. As a small number of humans begin to doubt the sincerity of the seemingly benevolent Visitors, FBI counter-terrorism agent Erica Evans (Elizabeth Mitchell) discovers that the aliens are actually reptilian humanoids wearing pseudo-human skin, have spent decades infiltrating human governments, businesses, and religious institutions, and are now in the final stages of their plan to take over the Earth. Erica joins the resistance movement, which includes Ryan (Morris Chestnut), a Visitor sleeper agent who over time developed human emotions and now wants to save humanity. Their rebellion is further challenged as the Visitors have won favor among the people of Earth by curing a variety of diseases, and have recruited Earth's youthincluding Erica's son Tyler (Logan Huffman)to serve them unknowingly as spies.[2]The series was announced in May 2009, to be executive produced by Scott Peters, Jace Hall, Steve Pearlman, and Jeffrey Bell.[10] Filming of the post-pilot episodes began on August 10, 2009.[11] Cast member Elizabeth Mitchell noted that the show would do service to the most iconic moments from the original franchise.[12]Peters later confirmed that in addition to potentially using cast members from the 1983 miniseries, the new series would nod to the original in other ways.[11] He said that when asking people what they thought were the most memorable elements of V, the top responses included "the huge ships, the red uniforms, eating the hamster, and [the] alien baby," adding that "we are well aware of those moments and are looking to put our own little spin on them to tip our hat to the old audience."[11][13]Entertainment Weekly put the original V on its 2008 list "The Sci-Fi 25: The Genre's Best Since 1982" and called Visitor leader Diana's devouring of a guinea pig "one of the best TV reveals ever."[14] Asked about the 1983 reveal of the Visitors' reptilian appearance beneath their human disguise, Peters noted "That was the other one, of course... We tried to put our own [spin on it]. We're... a little bit different than their execution of it. It wasn't so much latex mask as it is real flesh and blood."[11]The Hollywood Reporter called the idea behind V "a powerhouse concept that combines conflict, suspense and imagination with some heavy-duty philosophical issues," noting that the update "preserves the original framework but shifts the atmosphere to accommodate contemporary concerns... the militaristic notes will be more subdued. Instead, there will be more of a post-9/11 emphasis on questions of trust and terror."[3]Production on the show was temporarily suspended in August 2009, pending the resolution of a dispute filed with the Writers Guild of America by original creator Kenneth Johnson. Warner Bros. sought to remove Johnson's "created by" status by claiming that the new show was so fundamentally changed from Johnson's original premise that it constituted a standalone work and not a remake. The Writers Guild, however, disagreed, and when production resumed in September 2009, Johnson retained the credit.[15][16]In September 2009, it was announced that four episodes of V would air in November 2009, and that the series would resume its 12-episode season in March 2010 after the 2010 Winter Olympics.[17] ABC entertainment president Steve McPherson said, "We always intended to break the show up into 'pods' to make it more of an event."[17] As production of the fourth episode of V wrapped, it was announced on November 3, 2009, that Scott Rosenbaum had been named executive producer and showrunner of the series, with Peters and Hall remaining as executive producers.[4] Production of the remaining eight episodes resumed in January 2010 with new episodes returning March 30, 2010.[18] On May 13, 2010, ABC renewed V for a second season.[19] The second season premiered January 4, 2011, but the original order of 13 episodes was reduced to 10.[20]On May 13, 2011, ABC announced that V was canceled.[21]The series premiere of V garnered generally favorable reviews, scoring 67 out of 100 on Metacritic.[22] E! Online stated "on a scale of 1 to 10, we give it an 11. V is the best pilot we've seen in, well, forever."[23] USA Today's Robert Bianco put V on his list of the top ten new shows, stating that the remake is well-made and "quickly establishes its own identity,"[24] and The Hollywood Reporter called the new series "clever enough for a cult following and accessible enough to reach a broad demo."[3] King Features' entertainment reporter Cindy Elavsky calls V "the best new show on television, by far. The special effects are feature-film quality; the writing is intelligent and time-relevant; and the acting is first-rate. The first five minutes alone will hook you for the entire season."[25] The New York Times wrote that "The ideas in V, about alien encounters and mass delusion and media manipulation, are enticing. It's too bad that they're floating around in a show that at this early stage, is so slapdash and formulaic in its storytelling."[26] The Onion's The A.V. Club gave V's premiere a 'C' rating, calling it "rote and by-the-numbers."[27]The second season premiere received a score of 49/100 on Metacritic, indicating mixed reviews.[28]The re-imagined series has been interpreted by some reviewers as an allegory of the presidency of Barack Obama.[29][30][31] In his review of the show, Troy Patterson of Slate points out that bloggers and journalists had noticed parallels between the show's premise and the Obama administration, and writes that "if the show is to have the symbolic import that we expect from a science-fiction story, this is the only possible way to read V as a coherent text. The only problem with this analysis lies in its generous presupposition that the text is, in fact, coherent."[29] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted in her review that the fact the series was debuting on the first anniversary of Obama's election "was not lost on some ... TV critics" and also remarked that the use of phrases present in the series (such as "hope", "change", and "Universal Health Care" being offered by the Visitors) made it seem as though "Lou Dobbs had taken over the network, as those things only became popular with the current administration."[30] Chicago Tribune reviewer Glenn Garvin called the show "controversial", saying the series was "a barbed commentary on Obamamania that will infuriate the president's supporters and delight his detractors.".[31]The show's cast and crew deny the charges of bias. Actress Morena Baccarin acknowledges that she had modeled her character, Visitor leader Anna, after politicians but she and series executive producer Peters were surprised by the controversy. At a press conference at Summer TV Press Tour 2009, Peters said that the show was open to interpretation and that "people bring subjective thoughts to it... but there is no particular agenda."[30] Bell agreed, stating that it was simply "a show about spaceships."[29]The pilot episode which aired on November 3, 2009, garnered 14.3 million viewers and scored a 5.2 rating among 1849 year olds, making it the highest debut of the 200910 season.[32] The first four episodes of the first season averaged 9.75 million viewers and a 3.4 rating among 1849 year olds, ranking 34th in the television season. The remainder of season 1 began airing in March 2010, and by the end of the second half of the season the average viewer count had dropped to 5.72 million viewers and a 2.3 1849 rating, ranking 89th.[33]The second season averaged 6.93 million viewers per episode and had an average 1849 rating of 2.5,[34] ranking 75th for the 201011 season.[35]In the UK, the show premiered on the premium channel Syfy. The original broadcast of the pilot was seen by 481,000 viewers and was the most watched show for the network for its entire first season.[36] The second season premiered to 401,000 viewers, again becoming #1 for the network.[36] In October 2010, when the show debuted on the free-to-air channel Virgin 1, it gained even higher ratings. The pilot episode garnered 541,000 viewers (and 338,000 for the repeat viewing two days later). The show remained the channel's number one show for several weeks, and was in the channel's top 3 for the entirety of its first season.[37]V was nominated for Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series at the 2010 Creative Arts Emmy Awards for the pilot episode.[38] The show was also nominated for Favorite New TV Drama at the 36th People's Choice Awards[39] and for Best Television Presentation. Morena Baccarin was nominated for Best Supporting Actress on Television at the 36th Saturn Awards.[40] At the 37th Saturn Awards, the show received three nominations, for Best Network Series, Elizabeth Mitchell for Best Actress in Television, and Morena Baccarin for Best Supporting Actress in Television.[41]Following ABC's cancellation of V in May 2011, the fan letter-writing campaign "Project Alice" began writing to Warner Bros. to renew the series on a different network.[42] The campaign initially sought to get the show renewed on TNT, but more recent efforts have also concentrated on the CW Network as well. Both networks are owned by Warner Bros. Television's parent company, Time Warner.Project Alice has been officially endorsed by executive producers Scott Rosenbaum and Steve Pearlman, writer Gregg Hurwitz; and actors Mark Hildreth, Morena Baccarin, Jane Badler, Laura Vandervoort and Scott Wolf, each of whom have made videos expressing their support and admiration of their fans' campaign.Special features on the first season DVD and Blu-ray include a commentary track on "Fruition" by executive producers Scott Rosenbaum and Steve Pearlman, deleted scenes, and four behind-the-scenes featurettes "The Actor's Journey from Human to V", "An Alien in Human Skin: The Makeup FX of V", Breaking Story: The World of V", and "The Visual FX of V".V at TV.comElizabeth MitchellMorris ChestnutJoel GretschLogan HuffmanLourdes BenedictoLaura VandervoortCharles MesureMorena BaccarinScott WolfScott RosenbaumScott PetersJace HallYves SimoneauSteve PearlmanVV: The Final BattleV: The Series1 Premise2 Cast and characters

He is brought in by the NYPD for questioning regarding a copy-cat murder based on one of his novels. He is intrigued by this new window into crime and murder, and uses his connection with the Mayor to charm his way into shadowing the captivating Detective Kate Beckett, played by Stana Katic. Castle decides to use Beckett as the model for the main character of his next book series starring "Nikki Heat". Beckett, an avid reader of Castle's books, initially disapproves of having Castle shadow her on her cases, but later warms up and recognizes Castle as a useful resource in her team's investigations. At the end of season 4, they begin an intimate relationship.Real-life writers Stephen J. Cannell, James Patterson, Dennis Lehane, and Michael Connelly appear as themselves during periodic games of poker at Castle's apartment.

(the finale of a two-part episode featuring Dana Delany) not only attracted the highest audience of the show's run (14.5 million viewers), but was the highest rated show on ABC in its time slot in 14 years.[16]In June 2011, TNT acquired exclusive cable rights from Disney-ABC Domestic Television to air the first two seasons of Castle beginning in the summer of 2012.[47] In advance of the series' fourth season, TNT broadcast an eight-hour marathon of episodes on September 15, 2011, including five from season 3.[48] Castle began airing on TNT every Wednesday beginning September 26, 2012.[49] Castle also began airing in broadcast syndication on weekends beginning September 29, 2012.[50]In the series, Castle writes a novel titled Heat Wave. As a tie-in, ABC and sister publisher Hyperion Books released that novel as a real book (ISBN 978-1-4013-2382-0) with "Richard Castle" as the author. It is entirely in character from the dedication to the acknowledgments, although the latter references the principal cast and the show's creators by name.[51] ABC released the first half of the novel in weekly increments on their website.[52] The complete novel was published in September 2009 as a hardcover, debuting at #26 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[53] In its fourth week on the list, Heat Wave broke into the top 10 at #6.[54] Heat Wave was released in paperback (ISBN 978-1-4013-1040-0) on July 27, 2010 and debuted at #34 on The New York Times bestseller Paperback Mass-Market list.[55] It once again appeared on The New York Times bestseller list on May 27, 2012 at #19.[56]Naked Heat (ISBN 978-1-4013-2402-5), the sequel to Heat Wave, was released on September 28, 2010.[57] Naked Heat debuted at #7 on the New York Times Best Seller list.[58] As they did with Heat Wave, ABC released a series of the early chapters online as a promotional tool.[59]A third novel, titled Heat Rises (ISBN 978-1-4013-2443-8), was released on September 20, 2011.[60] It debuted at #1 on The New York Times bestseller list on October 9, 2011[61][62] and at #5 on the USA TODAY Best-Selling Books list.[63]The season three finale introduced a graphic novel based on Castle's previous novel character, Derrick Storm.

Born Richard Alexander Rodgers, he adopted the middle name Edgar in honor of Edgar Allan Poe. Castle was plagued with writer's block after killing off his popular lead character, Derrick Storm, whom he no longer found inspiring. He then found himself involved in the case of a copy-cat killer recreating murder scenes from his novels, investigated by NYPD Detective Kate Beckett. Castle discovers a new source of inspiration in her and soon begins shadowing her investigations, affording him the opportunity to use his knowledge and skills to help solve murders. He was divorced twice and shares an apartment with his daughter and his mother. Earlier seasons of the show depict him as an immature womanizer; however, later seasons show a more mature and sensible side of him.Stana Katic as Detective Kate Beckett: Beckett, a homicide detective with the NYPD, is a first-class investigator who has gained a reputation for being intrigued by unusual cases. She joined the force after her mother was murdered in an unsolved case.[4] After meeting Beckett, Castle is inspired to begin a new series of novels about a female NYPD detective named Nikki Heat, clearly based on Beckett. Initially cold and hard towards Castle, she soon warms up to him. In the season 4 finale, Beckett resigns from the NYPD after she and Det. Esposito hide from Captain Gates vital information regarding a case, but later reneges on this and is allowed to return after she serves her suspension. In the first two episodes of season 5, it is clear that Kate and Castle are now in an intimate relationship, which started at the end of the season 4 finale.Jon Huertas as Detective Javier Esposito: A former Army Special Forces sniper, Esposito works in the homicide division as part of Beckett's team. He is always ready with a sardonic comment to keep Beckett on her toes and enjoys the way Castle riles her. He and Kevin Ryan are close friends, even though they constantly argue about obscure facts.[5] He had a brief relationship with Dr. Lanie Parish in the third season, which ended with things being awkward between them making them unable to work around each other for sometime. He is suspended from the NYPD for hiding vital information from Captain Gates.Seamus Dever as Detective Kevin Ryan: Ryan also works as part of Beckett's team. He and Esposito regularly tease Beckett, but they are also protective of her.[6] The character was a late addition to the show as the original presentation pilot was only 37 minutes long.[7] Ryan married his girlfriend, Jenny O'Malley, in season four.Tamala Jones as Dr. Lanie Parish: Parish, a medical examiner with an upbeat outlook, is also a friend of Beckett's, one of the few people Beckett can talk to easily and without reservation. Parish notices the personal connection between Beckett and Castle and urges her to act on it.[8] In the third season, Lanie and Esposito began a relationship they believed was secret, though the other main characters were aware of it. They later broke up, making it awkward for them to be in each other's presence.Ruben Santiago-Hudson as Captain Roy Montgomery (Season 13): Montgomery, Beckett's boss, appreciates her determination and diligence but maintains a close watch to make sure the investigations go smoothly. He is amused by how much Castle annoys Beckett but also appreciates how effectively the two work together. At the end of season 3 he is killed after staging a trap to capture a hired killer involved in the conspiracy that killed Beckett's mother.[9]Molly Quinn as Alexis Castle: Alexis, Castle's teenage daughter by his first wife Meredith, is unusually intelligent for her age, and is often more mature and responsible than her father. She is very bright and enjoys school. A running gag in the series has her begging Castle to force her to study and do her homework instead of "fun" activities like parties and overnight trips. Her social and interpersonal issues often parallel some aspect of the case Castle and Beckett are investigating, and Castle sometimes asks her opinion on a killer's motivation.[10]Susan Sullivan as Martha Rodgers: Rodgers, an actress on and off Broadway, is Castle's mother and lives with him and Alexis. She helps her son through the difficulties of raising a teenage girl (even one as mature as Alexis) but also has an active social life of her own. She lives with Castle partly because a previous husband absconded with all her savings.[11] She is free-spirited and often gives Castle valuable advice regarding Beckett.Penny Johnson Jerald as Captain Victoria Gates (Season 4): Captain Montgomery's replacement. Formerly with Internal Affairs, Captain Gates (referred to by some as "Iron Gates") is more interested in career advancement, and takes a dimmer view than her predecessor of the Beckett-Castle dynamic.[12] Strict and unforgiving, she loathes Castle's presence at the precinct and looks at him as an inferior.Arye Gross as Dr. Sidney Perlmutter: a medical examiner who assists on some of Beckett's cases.Juliana Dever as Jenny O'Malley: Ryan's fiance and later his wife.Michael Trucco as Detective Tom Demming: a handsome robbery detective with whom Beckett briefly becomes involved.Monet Mazur as Gina Cowell: Castle's publisher and second ex-wife.Victor Webster as Dr. Josh Davidson: Beckett's mysterious motorcycle-riding, cardiac surgeon boyfriend.Ken Baumann as Ashley: Alexis' steady boyfriend. Alexis broke up with Ashley after her father and grandmother were involved in a hostage situation and Ashley was nowhere to be found to help her through it.Scott Paulin as Jim Beckett: Beckett's father.Bailey Chase as Will Sorenson: FBI agent and Beckett's ex-boyfriend.Jason Beghe as Mike Royce: Beckett's former training officer.Michael Dorn as Dr. Carver Burke: Beckett's psychiatrist who helps her overcome her shooting and also deal with her various hidden emotions.Geoff Pierson as Mr. Smith: a friend of Captain Montgomery holding evidence that keeps the murderer of Beckett's mother away from Beckett; Smith occasionally acts through Castle to protect Beckett. He is killed in "After the Storm".Michael Mosley as Jerry Tyson: a serial killer who returns to New York every few years to terrorize the city. After being identified by Castle, Tyson turns his attentions on the 12th Precinct, variously targeting members of Beckett's team. He is shot and presumed to be dead in "Probable Cause", though Castle expresses doubts about it.Official websiteCastle at the Internet Movie DatabaseThe template Tv.com is being considered for deletion.Castle Wiki,  an external wikiCastle at TVGuide.comHow I Met Your Mother is an American sitcom that premiered on CBS on September 19, 2005, created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays, and directed by Pamela Fryman.Set in Manhattan, How I Met Your Mother follows the social and romantic lives of Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) and his friends Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), and Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris).[1] As a framing device, the main character, Ted,[1] using voiceover narration by Bob Saget, in the year 2030 recounts to his son and his daughter the events that led to his meeting their mother.Known for its unique structure and eccentric humor, How I Met Your Mother has been a critical success, having received positive reviews throughout most of its run. The show has been nominated for seven Emmy Awards, winning six. In 2012, the series won the People's Choice Award for Best TV Network Comedy and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Best Male Comedy Actor.[2]How I Met Your Mother was inspired by Carter Bays' and Craig Thomas' idea to "write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York."[3] The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[4][5] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her, but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work, and was available.[4]MacLaren's, a bar in the middle of New York, in which some of the show is set, is based on a bar named McGee's.[6] It has a mural that Bays and Thomas both liked and wanted to incorporate into the show.[7] The name for the bar is from Carter Bays' assistant, Carl MacLaren; the bartender in the show is also named Carl.[8]Each episode is usually shot over three days in the Los Angeles-based Soundstage Studio 22[9] and features upwards of 50 scenes with quick transitions and flashbacks. However, the "Pilot" episode was filmed at CBS Radford.[10] The laugh track is later created by recording an audience being shown the final edited episode. Thomas claims that shooting before a live audience would be impossible because of the structure of the show and the numerous flashforwards in each episode and because doing so "would blur the line between 'audience' and 'hostage situation'."[11] Later seasons started filming in front of an audience on occasion when smaller sets are used.The theme song is a portion of "Hey Beautiful" by The Solids, of which Bays and Thomas are members. Episodes from Season 1 generally started with the opening credits. A cold opening has been used since Season 2. Viewers then occasionally see Ted's children on a couch and hear him talking to them, telling the story of how he met their mother. Alternatively, scenes from previous episodes or shots of New York City with Ted narrating over the top are shown. Thomas has explicitly said Future Ted is an unreliable narrator since he is trying to tell a story that happened over 20 years earlier;[12] this has been a plot point in several episodes such as "The Goat", "Oh Honey", "How I Met Everyone Else" and "The Mermaid Theory". Nevertheless, Thomas has also emphasized maintaining a coherent and consistent universe, and trying to avoid continuity errors, based on his experiences of being a fan of other shows.[13]A scene directly relating to the identity of the mother, involving Ted's future children, was filmed near the beginning of Season 2 for the show's eventual series finale.[14] This was primarily done because the teenage actors portraying them will be adults by the time the final season is shot.[15]During the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike, How I Met Your Mother shut down production; but, when the strike ended, the show returned on March 17, 2008, with nine new episodes.[16] A change in timeslot was also announced, to 8:30 pm ET/7:30 pm CT, flip-flopping from the summer schedule with The Big Bang Theory.[17] CBS renewed the show for a fourth season on May 14, 2008,[18] which premiered on September 22, 2008.[19]In September 2008, it was announced that Lifetime Television had purchased the right to rerun How I Met Your Mother at a rate of about $725,000 per episode.[20] The four-year syndication contract stipulated that the studio deliver at least 110 half-hour episodes by the year 2010, and allowed for up to eight seasons of the show. At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[21] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was announced.[22] On May 20, 2009, CBS announced that How I Met Your Mother would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new comedy Accidentally on Purpose. On January 12, 2010, the show hit the milestone of its 100th episode. It was also announced that the series would return for a sixth season on CBS.[23] In response to being syndicated, Thomas said, "We're thrilled that it will live on in other forms," and they were proud of the show and it was great to see the strong demand.[24] However, cast members have suggested the show will run for no more than eight seasons.[25]On September 13, 2010, reruns of the series began airing on local U.S. broadcast television stations and on Chicago-based cable superstation WGN America. Featured in these airings are vanity cards previously unseen in the CBS and Lifetime airings due to marginalized credit sequences used by the two networks. Shown in between the closing credits and the production company credits, these vanity cards show portions of "The Bro Code", a list of rules frequently referenced by Harris' character, Barney Stinson, on how men should interact with each other, with an emphasis on activities involving pursuing members of the opposite sex. The opening theme song for the syndicated reruns is also slightly edited, running shorter and not using all the pictures seen in the opening montage that runs on DVD and the original CBS broadcasts. The episodes are also slightly edited, leaving out a few details.One of the series' ongoing traditions involves giving guest roles to actors from various Joss Whedon productions, many of whom co-starred with Hannigan on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Bays attributes this to their being "huge fans" and to those casts representing "a big talent pool".[26]Another tradition involves the use of euphemisms for culturally sensitive issues. These include eating a sandwich for smoking marijuana and reading a magazine for going to the bathroom (during which one would look at a magazine) and "playing the bagpipes" for loud, raucous sex acts. These euphemisms, among others, have been used extensively throughout the series and have even been used as central plot themes, such as the episode "Benefits" in Season 4.On March 4, 2011, CBS announced that the show had been renewed for two more seasons,[27] with the seventh season premiering with back-to-back episodes on September 19, 2011.[2]On July 27, 2011, it was announced that the FX channel had picked up the show for syndication. FX began airing the show on September 5, 2011.[28]In the year 2030, Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) sits his daughter and son down to tell them the story of how he met their mother.The series begins in 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from his college years; Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher and aspiring artist. Lily and Marshall have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall finally proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), whom he met in the restroom at a bar four years earlier. Barney is a serial womanizer who concocts elaborate con games, usually involving costumes and fake identities, designed to bed women, whom he discards immediately afterward.Ted begins his search for his perfect soul mate and meets an ambitious young reporter from Canada, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), with whom he quickly falls in love. Robin, however, doesn't want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Future Ted reveals that Robin is not the mother after referring to her as "Aunt Robin".Ted begins dating a baker, Victoria (Ashley Williams), whom he meets at a friend's wedding, causing Robin to become jealous and realize she does have feelings for Ted. Victoria, having been offered a fellowship in pastry-making, moves to Germany; and she and Ted try a long-distance relationship. Once Ted learns Robin has feelings for him, he tells her he broke up with Victoria, even though he hasn't. They almost have sex when Victoria calls and Robin answers, mistaking Ted's phone for her own. Ted and Victoria then break up and an angry Robin distances herself from Ted, but they eventually make up and decide to date.Meanwhile, Lily begins to wonder if she's missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall, and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking up with Marshall in the process. The season ends with Ted coming back to the apartment, the morning after spending the night with Robin for the first time, to find Marshall sitting in the rain with Lily's engagement ring, devastated by their sudden break up.Ted and Robin are now a couple; meanwhile, a heartbroken Marshall tries to continue his life without Lily. After enduring numerous emotional breakdowns, Marshall's friends step in, and Barney, using sly catch phrases and pick up lines, tries to get Marshall back in the dating game. Later, Lily, after finally realizing she is not meant to be an artist, returns to New York. She is reunited with Marshall, their engagement is reinstated. When Robin refuses to go to the mall or explain why, Marshall suspects she is married, and Barney suspects she has performed in adult films. They both bet on it, issuing Lily as "Slap Bet Commissioner." Lily oversees the search for the truth, as they discover that Robin was a teenage pop star named "Robin Sparkles", and Marshall eventually earns the right to slap Barney 5 times whenever he wants to. It is revealed Barney has a gay half-brother named James (Wayne Brady) and that he believes that Bob Barker is his father, unaware that his mother lied to him, and takes a trip to California to be a contestant on The Price is Right to meet his "father." While on the show, Barney wins all of the prizes and gives them to Lily and Marshall as a 'happy early wedding' present.In the season finale, Ted reveals to Barney that he and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on marriage and kids. They didn't tell anyone in order to avoid taking attention away from Lily and Marshall's wedding. The season ends with Barney excited at the prospect of Ted and himself being single guys on the town again, and ends the season with Barney saying, "This is going to be legen- wait for it..."Barney begins the season with the word, "-dary!" Robin returns from a trip to Argentina with her new boyfriend, Gael (Enrique Iglesias), and Ted must adjust to life as just her friend, while watching Robin and Gael fawning over each other.

The series, which is loosely based on Fey's experiences as head writer for Saturday Night Live, takes place behind the scenes of a fictional live sketch comedy series depicted as airing on NBC. The series' name refers to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, the address of the GE Building, in which the NBC Studios are located.[1] This series is produced by Broadway Video and Little Stranger, Inc., in association with NBCUniversal.[2]All 30 Rock episodes are produced in a single camera setup (with the exception of the live episodes that were taped in the multi-camera format), [3] and are filmed in New York.[4][5] The pilot episode premiered on October 11, 2006[6] and six full seasons have aired since. The series' supporting cast includes Tracy Morgan, Jane Krakowski, Jack McBrayer, Scott Adsit, Judah Friedlander, Katrina Bowden, Keith Powell, Lonny Ross, John Lutz, Kevin Brown, Grizz Chapman and Maulik Pancholy.[2]30 Rock has been a critical success, winning several major awards (including Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2007, 2008, and 2009), and achieving the top ranking on myriad critics' year-end best of 2006 and 2007 lists.[2] On July 14, 2009, the series was nominated for 22 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most in a single year for a comedy series.[7]In 2009, Comedy Central and WGN America bought the syndication rights to the show, which began airing on both networks on September 19, 2011;[8] the series also entered into local broadcast syndication on September 19, 2011.[9]On May 11, 2012, it was announced that NBC has renewed 30 Rock for an abbreviated 13-episode seventh and final season.[10] The series is scheduled to air its hour-long final episode on January 31, 2013.[11][12]In 2002, Fey was the head writer and a performer on Saturday Night Live (SNL). She pitched the show that became 30 Rock to NBC, originally as a sitcom about cable news. NBC Entertainment president Kevin Reilly felt that "Fey was using the news setting as a fig leaf for her own experience and [he] encouraged her to write what she knew."[13] The show was subsequently reworked to revolve around an SNL-style sketch show. After being presented to Reilly once more, the show was set to air during the 20052006 television season. Just before the deal went through, however, the show was nearly brushed aside by Anthony Lewis and Jack Melcher, two NBC executives who fought the idea, fearing that Fey's removal from SNL would result in a severe cut to the show's ratings.[citation needed] Eventually, Lewis gave in just a month before his retirement, and Melcher backed down. In May 2003, Fey signed a contract with NBC to remain in her SNL head writer position until at least the 20042005 television season and to develop a prime-time project to be produced by Broadway Video and NBC Universal.[14] Filming was postponed due to Tina Fey's pregnancy.[15]During the 20042005 pilot season, a pilot was announced named Untitled Tina Fey Project. The 30 Rock pilot focused on the boss of a variety show who has to manage her relationships with the show's volatile star and its charismatic executive producer. The storyline evolved into one that dealt with a head writer of a variety show who dealt with both the stars as well as the show's new network executive.[16] 30 Rock was officially given the green light to air May 15, 2006, along with a 13-episode order.[17]The series underwent further changes during the months leading up to and following its debut. A May 2006 press release mentioned that sketches from The Girlie Show would be made available in their entirety on NBC's broadband website, DotComedy.com. The idea was to air the fictitious TGS with Tracy Jordan online.[18] This aspect of the series was abandoned prior to its debut.Inside scenes for 30 Rock are mostly filmed at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, Queens, NYC (Studio 8H in 30 Rock in Manhattan for two live episodes).[4] In the episodes "Cleveland" and "Hiatus," Battery Park City, Manhattan and Douglaston, Queens doubled for Cleveland, Ohio and Needmore, Pennsylvania, respectively.[19] In the episode "Gavin Volure," stock footage of the Arkansas Governor's Mansion was used for exterior shots of the home of Steve Martin's character.[20]The title sequence is made up of photos and video of 30 Rockefeller Plaza and features the series regulars. The sequence ends with a time lapse of the building and then a title card reading '30 Rock'. The sequence has remained mostly the same throughout the series, although there have been changes to the photos of most of the actors.The series features a "jaunty" jazz score.[21] Most of the incidental music melody is played by either clarinet, bass clarinet, saxophone, or strings, often as wildly varying renditions of the usual central theme. The music is composed by Fey's husband Jeff Richmond, who is also a producer for 30 Rock. Richmond wrote the theme music, which was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Theme Music.[22] Seven short, original songs have been featured in episodes, five of which were performed by Jane Krakowski,[23][24][25][26][27] another performed by Tina Fey and Jason Sudeikis,[28] and another performed by Tracy Morgan.[29] The show has also covered three existing songs,[30][31][32] including the song "Midnight Train to Georgia" by Gladys Knight and the Pips. The song had its lyrics altered to accommodate the character Kenneth being "misinformed about the time [of the 11:45 train]."[32] The song "Oh My" performed by The Gray Kid is heard throughout the episode "The Source Awards", which was mixed with a piano arrangement composed by Richmond.[33] "Kidney Now!", a rendition of the popular song, "We Are the World", is performed by various artists in the Season 3 finale. Other popular songs have been featured (with blessings by the singers), like "I Will Remember You" or "Bitch".The 30 Rock Original Television Soundtrack was released by the Relativity Music Group on November 16, 2010.[34]On April 2, 2008, NBC announced 30 Rock 360, an online extension of the 30 Rock series. The extension featured Jack Donaghy's Online Business Courses (or Jack U). Users were also able to read Jack's blogs and upload their own business advice in video form. Users were able to submit skits for TGS with Tracy Jordan and act out skits from TGS. The feature reopened Ask Tina, an interactive question and answer platform in which users could ask Fey questions. Fey answered the questions in video form.[35] Ask Tina was a fixture on NBC.com's 30 Rock section throughout the first season.[36]The plot of 30 Rock revolves around the cast and crew of the fictional sketch comedy series TGS with Tracy Jordan (originally called The Girlie Show), which is filmed in Studio 6H inside 30 Rockefeller Plaza.[23] The series features an ensemble cast.[2] The series features seven roles that receive star billing during the opening credits:Beginning with season two, three characters, who were credited as guest stars during season one, received star billing after the opening credits in addition to the principal cast:[2]Beginning with season three, three characters who were credited as guest stars in the first two seasons received star billing after the opening credits in addition to Bowden, Powell, Ross, and the principal cast. They are credited only in the episodes in which they appear:Beginning with season four, episode seven, one character who was credited as a guest star in the first three seasons was listed after the opening credits in addition to Bowden, Powell, Brown, Chapman, and Pancholy:Tina Fey worked with Jen McNamara and Adam Bernstein for the casting of the series.[37] Fey's first act as casting director was to cast herself as the lead character, Liz Lemon, who is said to be much like Fey herself when she first became head writer on SNL.[38] The next actor to be cast was Tracy Morgan as Tracy Jordan,[39] who was then a former castmate of Fey's in SNL. Morgan was asked by Fey to play the role, and he believed it was "right up [his] alley and it was tailor made for [him]".[40] Fey said that the character of Kenneth Parcell was written with Jack McBrayer in mind. McBrayer is an old friend of Fey (they worked together at Second City in Chicago), and she "really wanted him for that part and was very happy when no one objected".[37]Rachel Dratch, Fey's longtime comedy partner and fellow SNL alumna, was originally cast to portray Jenna. Dratch played the role in the show's original pilot, but in August 2006, Jane Krakowski was announced as Dratch's replacement, with Dratch remaining involved in the show playing various characters.[41] Fey explained the change by noting that Dratch was "better-suited to playing a variety of eccentric side characters",[42] and that the role of Jenna was more of a straight-ahead acting part.Although Fey went on to say that "Rachel and I were both very excited about this new direction",[42] Dratch said that she was not happy with the media's depiction of the change as a demotion;[43] however, she was also skeptical about the reasons she was given for the change, and was not happy with the reduction in the number of episodes in which she would appear.[43] Following the first season, Dratch has only appeared in a handful of episodes.Shortly following the casting of McBrayer and Dratch, Alec Baldwin was cast as Jack Donaghy, the "totally uncensored" Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming.[44] Fey said that the character of Jack Donaghy was written with Baldwin in mind, and she was "very pleasantly surprised when he agreed to do it".[37] Judah Friedlander was cast as Frank Rossitano, a staff writer of The Girlie Show. Friedlander had never met Fey before auditioning for a role in 30 Rock. His character was based on at least two writers that Fey used to work with at SNL, but he has said that he "certainly brought some of [his] own things to it as well".[45] Finally, Scott Adsit was cast as Pete Hornberger, a longtime friend of Liz's and producer of The Girlie Show. Adsit, an old friend of Fey, also had his character written based on him.[37]Following SNL's ongoing tradition,[46] 30 Rock had several real-life politician cameos, examples being Al Gore (twice) and Condoleezza Rice (as Jack Donaghy's former lover).[47]Season one began airing in the United States on October 11, 2006,[6] and featured 21 episodes.[48] The season finale aired on April 26, 2007.[49] Jack Donaghy, the "Head of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming" at General Electric (GE), is transferred to work at the NBC headquarters, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and retool the late night sketch comedy series The Girlie Show. The show's cast and crew are outraged by this; especially head writer Liz Lemon and main actress Jenna Maroney. Jack proceeds to wreak havoc on The Girlie Show, forcing Liz to hire the off-the-wall movie star Tracy Jordan. He again angers the cast and crew of The Girlie Show when he changes the name to TGS with Tracy Jordan (or just TGS).As the season progresses, the episodes become less about TGS and more about how the characters deal with juggling their lives and their jobsspecifically the protagonist, Liz Lemon, but other characters are also explored. Episodes also become less self-contained and various story arcs develop in the second half of the season. For example, the first major story arc centers on Liz's relationship with Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), "The Beeper King." Other story arcs include: Jenna promoting her movie The Rural Juror; Tracy going on the run from the Black Crusaders; Jack's engagement, which was eventually called off, to a Christie's auctioneer named Phoebe (Emily Mortimer); and another relationship of Liz's with Floyd (Jason Sudeikis).Guest stars include Nathan Lane, Isabella Rossellini, Will Arnett, Wayne Brady, Elaine Stritch, Whoopi Goldberg, Conan O'Brien, LL Cool J and Ghostface Killah.Season two began airing in the United States on October 4, 2007,[50] and featured 15 episodes.[51] The second season was originally intended to consist of 22 episodes but the order was cut to 15 due to the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike.[52][53] The season finale aired on May 8, 2008.[54] After Liz broke up with Floyd in the summer, she is looking for ways to rebound. When Jerry Seinfeld confronts Jack about a new marketing campaign which featured clips of Seinfeld's sitcom, Seinfeld, in all NBC shows, he has a chance encounter with Liz that gives her some much needed advice. During the TGS summer hiatus, Jenna becomes overweight due to performing in the Broadway show Mystic Pizza: The Musical (based on the real 1988 film Mystic Pizza). Tracy has encountered some marital problems with his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) and they become separated, but later reunite.During the season, Jack develops a relationship with a Democratic congresswoman named Celeste "C.C." Cunningham (Edie Falco). They later break up. An arc that was established in the first season but becomes more apparent in the second regards Jack running for the GE chairmanship against his archnemesis Devon Banks (Will Arnett). The season ends with Liz planning to adopt a child after believing she was pregnant with Dennis' baby. Kenneth also travels to Beijing to be a page at the 2008 Summer Olympics and Tracy invents a pornographic video game. Jack ends the season working at a new government job in Washington, D.C., but plans to get fired by proposing a "gay bomb."30 Rock returned with a third season as part of NBC's 2008 fall schedule, airing immediately after The Office. The show experienced a large ratings and popularity spike this season after Tina Fey's highly praised performance as Sarah Palin on SNL. This is also the season where the show made Emmy history, being nominated for 22 Emmy awards. The season consisted of 22 episodes.[55][56][57] Oprah Winfrey guest starred in the second episode, playing herself (actually a drug-induced hallucination of Liz's), as well as Jennifer Aniston playing Liz's ex roommate. Salma Hayek[58] also appeared for a multi-episode arc, portraying Jack's new girlfriend, Elisa. Other guest stars this season included John Lithgow, Kerry Butler, Megan Mullally and Steve Martin.[59] Jon Hamm played Liz's love interest and neighbor for several episodes.[60] Alan Alda appeared in the season's final two episodes as Milton Greene, Jack's biological father. The season finale featured multiple musical guests, including Talib Kweli, Michael McDonald, Norah Jones, Steve Earle, Moby, Clay Aiken, the Beastie Boys, Adam Levine, Mary J. Blige, Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Rhett Miller, Cyndi Lauper, Sara Bareilles, Wyclef Jean, and Rachael Yamagata, performing "Kidney Now!", an organ donation drive spoof of We Are The World and "Just Stand Up!".[61]The fourth season of 30 Rock premiered on October 15, 2009. Like the previous season 3, it also consisted of 22 episodes. A recurring story arc early in the season revolved around Jack's request that Liz cast a new actor for TGS, and Liz's subsequent search for the perfect comedian, much to the dismay of Jenna and Tracy, who fear losing their spotlight. The later half of the season focused on two complementary story arcs: Jack's inability to choose between two mistresses, and Liz's inability to find a boyfriend to live up to her expectations and Jenna's relationship with a Jenna Maroney impersonator. The season has also featured such guest stars as Julianne Moore, Jon Bon Jovi, Cheyenne Jackson, Sherri Shepherd, Will Forte, Elizabeth Banks, Michael Sheen, Matt Damon, and James Franco.30 Rock premiered its fifth season on September 23, 2010 in the Thursday 8:30p.m. time slot.[62]An episode of 30 Rock's fifth season was filmed and broadcast live, twice, on the evening of October 14, 2010. The two separate recordings resulted in a live telecast of the episode to American viewers in both the West and East Coast, to ensure both would view a live performance. Filmed in front of a live audience, the episode aired at 8:30pm EDT and PDT on NBC. A ratings success, the episode was also met with positive reviews.[63][63][64][65]30 Rock moved to the 10/9c from January 20, 2011.[66]Season 5 focuses on Liz Lemon's continuing relationship with Carol Burnett (Matt Damon), Jack's start into fatherhood with fiance Avery (Elizabeth Banks), struggling with the merger of NBCUniversal with Kabletown, Tracy's foray into getting an EGOT, and Kenneth's attempt to get back to NBC. Aside from featuring the return of Rachel Dratch in the Live Show, other guest stars include Matt Damon, Elizabeth Banks, Susan Sarandon (as Frank's former teacher- who was in prison due to their relationship while he was a student- and present girlfriend), Paul Giamatti, Sherri Shepherd, Queen Latifah, Rob Reiner, John Amos, Jon Hamm, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Bill Hader, Chris Parnell, Kelsey Grammer, Buck Henry, David Gregory, John Slattery, Daniel Sunjata, Will Forte, Kelly Coffield Park, Elaine Stritch, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, Alan Alda, Cheyenne Jackson, Robert De Niro, Dean Winters, Ken Howard, Vanessa Minnillo, Brian Williams, Richard Belzer, Ice-T, John Cho, Chlo Grace Moretz, Terrance Mann (as oceanographer Robert Ballard), Cristin Milioti (as Abby Flynn in "TGS Hates Women"), Eion Bailey, Adriane Lenox. Michael Keaton and Margaret Cho (as Avery's kidnapper, Korean dictator Kim Jong-il). Tom Hanks and Aubrey Graham.On November 15, 2010, NBC announced 30 Rock had been renewed for a sixth season, set to air at the beginning of 2012, due to Tina Fey's pregnancy.[67] The season began airing January 12, 2012 in its new 8pm timeslot leading into Parks and Recreation, The Office and Up All Night.[68]Many LGBT groups called for Tracy Morgan's resignation or dismissal from the show due to anti-gay comments he made between the end of season 5 and the filming for season 6.[69] Morgan issued an apology and continued with his starring role.[70] 30 Rock had previously received an award from GLAAD, commending the show on its portrayal of LGBT themes and characters.[71] The scandal inspired the second episode of the season, in which Tracy Jordan goes on an offensive rant during a standup set, forcing the show to apologize on his behalf after he mistakenly calls Glad, the trash bag company, instead of GLAAD.The producers have also pledged that Jack and Avery's storyline would acknowledge the death of Kim Jong-Il, which occurred shortly before the delayed season premiere. Though the first few episodes only made passing references to Avery and her new husband, North Korea's apparent new leader Kim Jong-Un, executive producer Robert Carlock told US Weekly that they would be taking it into account as they figured out how to get Avery back, even suggesting they might bring back Margaret Cho and imply that Kim faked his death.[72]30 Rock is slated to return for a final, abbreviated season consisting of 1314 episodes.[73] The season premiere aired on October 4, 2012.[74] The final episode will be an hour long episode.[75]Alec Baldwin reportedly approached NBC and offered to cut his pay in order for 30 Rock to be renewed for a full 7th and 8th season. [76] He stated the following (via Twitter) on October 4, 2012: "I offered NBC to cut my pay 20% in order to have a full 7th and 8th seasons of 30 Rock. I realize times have changed". [77]30 Rock has received acclaim from critics[78] but has struggled to attract viewers.[79] Robert Abele of LA Weekly declared that the show was "A weirdly appropriate and hilarious symbol of our times."[80] The Wall Street Journal's Dorothy Rabinowitz wrote that "The standard caution is relevant debut episodes tend to be highly polished. All the more reason to enjoy the hilarious scenes and fine ensemble cast here."[81] Some less favorable reviews were received from Brian Lowry of Variety. Lowry said that "Despite her success with 'Mean Girls,' [Tina] Fey mostly hits too-familiar notes in the pilot. Moreover, she's a limited protagonist, which is problematic."[82] Criticism was also received from Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune, who said that "30 Rock is less than the sum of its parts, and, as an entry in the single-camera comedy sweepstakes, it fails to show either the inspired inventiveness of Arrested Development or provide the surprisingly perceptive character studies of The Office."[83] Metacritic gave the pilot episode a Metascorea weighted average based on the impressions of a select thirty-one critical reviewsof 67 out of 100.[84]At the end of 2006, LA Weekly listed 30 Rock as one of the best "Series of the Year."[85] The show also appeared on similar year end "best of" 2006 lists published by The New York Times,[86] The A.V. Club,[87] The Boston Globe,[88] The Chicago Sun-Times,[88] Entertainment Weekly,[88] The Los Angeles Times,[88] The Miami Herald,[88] People Weekly,[88] and TV Guide.[88] The Associated Press wrote that NBC's "Thursday night comedy blockmade up of My Name Is Earl, The Office, Scrubs, and 30 Rockis consistently the best night of prime time viewing for any network."[89] In 2007, it appeared on The Boston Globe's "best of" list[90] as well as the "best of" lists of The Chicago Sun-Times,[90] The Chicago Tribune,[90] Entertainment Weekly,[90] The Los Angeles Times,[90] Newark Star-Ledger,[90] The New York Times,[90] Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,[90] The San Francisco Chronicle,[90] The San Jose Mercury News,[90] TV Guide and USA Today.[90] 30 Rock was named the best series of 2007 by Entertainment Weekly.[90]In December 2009, Newsweek magazine ranked 30 Rock as the best comedy on TV for the past decade,[91] and at the end of 2010, Metacritic reported that the show ranked 12th place in their list of collected Television Critic Top Ten Lists.[92]Capping its critically successful first season, 30 Rock won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series and Elaine Stritch was awarded an Emmy in September 2007 for her work as a guest actress in "Hiatus."[93] Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin were nominated in the Outstanding Lead Actress and Outstanding Lead Actor in a comedy series categories respectively.[94] "Jack-Tor" and "Tracy Does Conan" were both nominated in the category of Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.[94] 30 Rock received four Creative Arts Emmy Awards.[94] Alec Baldwin received the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series Comedy or Musical in 2007.[95] Baldwin also received the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series in 2007.[96] The show also received various other guild award nominations during its first season.[97][98]In 2008, Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin both won Screen Actors Guild Awards.[99] The series took home the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Series in 2008.[100] It also received the Danny Thomas Producer of the Year Award in Episodic Series Comedy from the Producers Guild of America in 2008.[101] 30 Rock received 17 Emmy nominations, for its second season, meaning it was the second most nominated series of the year.[102] These 17 nominations broke the record for the most nominations for a comedy series, meaning that 30 Rock was the most nominated comedy series for any individual Emmy year. The previous holder of this record was The Larry Sanders Show in 1996 with 16 nominations.[103] 30 Rock also won the Television Critics Association Award for "Outstanding Achievement in Comedy."[104]Also in 2008, 30 Rock completed a sweep of the major awards for best comedy series at that year's Primetime Emmy Awards. The show won Outstanding Comedy Series, Alec Baldwin was recognized as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and Tina Fey was given the award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. This marks the eighth time in the history of the Emmy awards that a show won best series plus best lead actor and actress.[105] Tina Fey also won the award for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series for the episode "Cooter".At the 2008 Golden Globe awards, 30 Rock won the award for Best Television Series Musical or Comedy, Alec Baldwin won Best Actor in a Television Musical or Comedy, and Tina Fey won Best Actress in a Television Musical or Comedy.[106]The Peabody Board.[107]For the show's 2007 episodes, 30 Rock received a Peabody Award at the 67th Annual Peabody Awards.[107] Upon announcing the award, the Peabody Board commended the show for being "not only a great workplace comedy in the tradition of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, complete with fresh, indelible secondary characters, but also a sly, gleeful satire of corporate media, especially the network that airs it."[108]In 2009, 30 Rock received a record-breaking 22 Primetime Emmy Award nominations[7] and won five Emmy Awards, including Best Comedy Series and Best Actor in a Comedy Series (Alec Baldwin).Below, "Rank" refers to how well 30 Rock rated compared to other television series which aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season. For example, in its first year, there were 101 television series that were more highly rated. The television season tends to begin in September, of any given year, and end during the May of the following year. "Viewers" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes (broadcast in the series' "Regular Timeslot") of 30 Rock aired during the television season. Although the viewer average may be higher for some seasons than others, the rank will not necessarily be higher. This is due to the number of programs aired during primetime. In some seasons there may be more regular programs aired during primetime than in others. The "Season premiere" is the date that the first episode of the season aired. Similarly, the "Season finale" is the date that the final episode of the season aired.The pilot episode generated 8.13million viewers,[124] the series' highest ratings until that of its third season premiere which garnered 8.5million viewers. In its original timeslot of Wednesday at 8:00pm EST, the show averaged 6.23million viewers.[125] 30 Rock aired on Wednesdays for its first four episodes. The season's lowest ratings were achieved by "Jack the Writer" and "Hard Ball" which both achieved 4.61million viewers.[126][127] The season two premiere, "SeinfeldVision," was viewed by 7.33million viewers, the highest rating since the pilot.[128] 30 Rock entered a hiatus due to the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike on January 10, 2008.[52] The episode that aired on that date was viewed by 5.98million viewers.[129] The second season finale, "Cooter", which aired on May 8, 2008, was viewed by 5.6million viewers.[54]On December 29, 2006, Nielsen Media Research (NMR) reported the results of having, for the first time, monitored viewers who use a digital video recorder to record shows for later viewing. NMR reported that 30 Rock adds nearly 7.5% to its total audience every week as a result of viewers who use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its initial airing.[130] A March 2007 report from MAGNA Global, based on NMR data about viewership ranked by among adults 2554, shows that as of the time of the report 30 Rock's viewers have a median income of $65,000, high enough to place the show tied at 11th in affluence with several other shows. This is during a period where for the season 30 Rock is tied at No. 85 in the 1849 demographic.[131] During its second season, 30 Rock ranked in fourth place, against all primetime programming, for television series' which are watched by viewers with income above $100,000.[132] Following Fey's popular impressions of Alaskan governor Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live, the third season premiere was seen by 8.5million viewers, making it the highest viewed episode in the series.[133] The premiere earned a 4.1 preliminary adults 1849 rating, an increase of 21% from the second season premiere.[134]30 Rock also airs in other countries; ratings and rankings for some of these markets include:Two shows debuting on 200607 NBC lineup, 30 Rock and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, revolved around the off-camera happenings on a sketch comedy series. Similarities between the two led to speculation that only one of them would be picked up. Baldwin said "I'd be stunned if NBC picked up both shows. And ours has the tougher task, as a comedy, because if it's not funny, that's it."[147] Kevin Reilly, then president of NBC Entertainment, was supportive of Fey, describing the situation as a "high-class problem":Evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows, as well as the conflict between them, arose when Aaron Sorkin, the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week, a request Michaels denied.[147] Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with 30 Rock.[149] Fey said that "it's just bad luck for me that in my first attempt at prime time I'm going up against the most powerful writer on television. I was joking that this would be the best pilot ever aired on Trio. And then Trio got canceled."[147] Fey wound up "beating" Sorkin when Studio 60 was canceled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second. Though 30 Rock's first-season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60,[109] Studio 60 was more expensive to produce.[150]One early promo for 30 Rock portrayed Alec Baldwin mistakenly thinking he would meet Sorkin,[151] and when asked on her "Ask Tina" space what she thought of the criticism that 30 Rock received, Fey jokingly replied that people who did not like it were probably confusing it with Studio 60.[152] However, none of 30 Rock's producers have given Studio 60 any serious criticism, positive or negative. In a November 1, 2006 interview, Fey said she had seen the first two episodes of Studio 60. When asked what her impressions were, she jokingly replied, "I can't do impressions of Bradley Whitford and Matthew Perry."[153]At least five 30 Rock episodes have briefly parodied Studio 60:Some critics have compared 30 Rock to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, with parallels drawn between the relationship of Liz and Jack and that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant.[156][157] It has also been compared to That Girl.[158][159] Like That Girl and Mary Tyler Moore, 30 Rock is a sitcom centering on an unmarried, brunette career woman living in a big city where she works in the television industry. That Girl was parodied in the opening segment of 30 Rock's pilot.It was announced in 2009 that off-network syndication rights for 30 Rock had been acquired by Comedy Central and WGN America for a combined value in the range of $800,000 an episode.[160][161] In Canada CityTV airs it at 7:00pm in Sydication and Omni 1 airs it at 10:00pm in syndication.Weekly installments of 30 Rock are available to download for a per-episode fee, to U.S. residents only, via Amazon Instant Video, Apple's iTunes Store, Google Play, and the now-defunct "NBC Direct" service. In addition to paid downloads, all six complete seasons can be streamed on Netflix, but this requires a paid subscription.[162] Both NBC.com and Hulu.com stream episodes for free, but only the five most current installments are available for viewing, and Hulu has ceased streaming previous seasons.[163][164][165]30 Rock at TV.com1 Production

replaced bienniallySkins is a British teen drama that follows the lives of a group of teenagers in Bristol, South West England, through the two years of sixth form. Its controversial storylines have explored issues such as dysfunctional families, mental illness (such as eating disorders), adolescent sexuality, substance abuse and death. The show was created by father-and-son television writers Bryan Elsley and Jamie Brittain for Company Pictures,[1] and premiered on E4 on 25 January 2007.[2] The show went on to be a critical success as well as a ratings winner within its target demographic. As an ongoing drama series, Skins is atypical in that it replaces its primary cast every two years. In 2009, producers announced a Skins film was being discussed, but as of 2012 announcement of the show's cancellation, nothing has come of these plans. A specially-commissioned final seventh series is set to broadcast in 2013 which will feature the three casts from its 200712 run.[3] The show's name comes from the rolling papers of joints known as "skins".[4]Other ventures to expand the brand have included a failed North American adaptation, which aired on MTV in 2011; it was cancelled after one season after advertisers abandoned the series in response to low ratings and the significant controversy which arose over its depiction of teen sexuality.Tony Stonem (Nicholas Hoult) is an attractive, intelligent and popular boy. His manipulative ways often go unnoticed by many, and are a catalyst for the majority of the events in the series. Sid Jenkins (Mike Bailey) is Tony's best friend, but has an entirely opposite personality. He lacks confidence, is socially uneasy and struggles with school work. Tony's girlfriend is Michelle Richardson (April Pearson), a girl who can never stay angry at his mischievous behaviour for long. Outwardly, Michelle appears shallow, vain and conceited, but she works hard, has a strong interest in French and Spanish, and is very emotionally mature. She is friends with Cassie Ainsworth (Hannah Murray), an eccentric girl who suffers from an eating disorder. Cassie attempts to hide her own struggles with mental health while her flamboyant parents ignore her in favour of their new baby.Chris Miles (Joe Dempsie) is the party animal of the group. He has a difficult home life; he lost his brother to a hereditary subarachnoid haemorrhage at a young age, and is living alone due to his ambivalent father and absent mother. He has a crush on his psychology teacher Angie (Siwan Morris). Jal Fazer (Larissa Wilson) is a sensible girl with a talent for playing the clarinet. Her runaway mother has left her to live with her famous musician father and aspiring rapper brothers. She is best friends with Michelle. Maxxie Oliver (Mitch Hewer) loves to dance, and is considered "one of the lads". He is portrayed as attractive, seductive and talented, and is well accepted by his friends and peers. His best friend Anwar Kharral (Dev Patel) takes a pick-and-choose approach to Islam, and has no qualms about indulging in pre-marital sex, alcohol and drugs, despite his religion's polices against them. He has a slightly off-the-wall personality, known for his silly antics and sense of humour. Only appearing in the second series, Lucy, better known as "Sketch" (Aimee-Ffion Edwards), is a quiet Welsh girl who is polite yet unnerving. She is a young carer for her mother Sheila, who suffers from multiple sclerosis.As well as the regular cast, there are several important recurring characters. Effy Stonem (Kaya Scodelario) is Tony's younger sister, and shares many of her brother's qualities. She is mysterious and manipulative, and selectively mute during the first series; she regularly breaks the fourth wall. Abigail Stock (Georgina Moffat) is an upper class school girl with sociopathic tendencies, and one of Tony's many sexual conquests. "Posh" Kenneth (Daniel Kaluuya) goes to the same college as the main cast and often spends time with the boys. Madison "Mad" Twatter (Stephen Walters) features as Sid's emergency drug dealer, Doug (Giles Thomas) is a senior teacher at Roundview College, and British comedian and co-writer Josie Long appears as the college's careers counsellor.The central cast's parents are often played by well-known British actors credited in a guest starring role. Harry Enfield portrays Tony and Effy's father, Jim Stonem, and Morwenna Banks plays his wife Anthea Stonem. Peter Capaldi and Josie Lawrence act as Sid's parents, Mark and Liz Jenkins. Neil Morrissey and Naomi Allisstone play Cassie's parents Marcus and Margeritte. Arabella Weir acts as Michelle's mother, Anna Richardson, and Danny Dyer as her step father Malcolm. Ronnie Fazer (Mark Monero) is Jal's musician father, and Elaine (Josette Simon) her estranged mother. Mark Heap portrays Graham Miles, Chris' father, and Sarah Lancashire his stepmother Mary. Inder Manocha, Istiak Kharral plays Anwar's father, with Nina Wadia as Anwar's mother, Bibi Kharral. Heidi Monsen acts as Dr. Victoria Stock, Abigail's mother. Maxxie's parents, Walter and Jackie Oliver, are played by Bill Bailey and Fiona Allen.Elizabeth "Effy" Stonem (Kaya Scodelario), Tony's younger sister, becomes the lead character for the second generation. Effy is pretty, popular and, like her brother, a natural leader. She is also quiet and distant, attempting to keep her own troubles hidden. Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell) is her friend, having appeared for the first time in a second series episode. She is innocent to the sexual and narcotic world in which Effy indulges, but is ready and willing to explore it. Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) is an immigrant from the Congo, with a morally upright outlook and good-hearted nature, and his storyline sees him becoming romantically involved with Pandora.James Cook (Jack O'Connell), Freddie Mclair (Luke Pasqualino) and JJ Jones (Ollie Barbieri) have been best friends since childhood. Though Cook is charismatic and sociable, he is also boisterous and not afraid of authority. His womanising drives many of the events in the series. By contrast, Freddie is an easy-going skater who likes to smoke weed, and as the more sensible and responsible friend, is often put out by Cook's behaviour. Cook and Freddie are both drawn to Effy, which drives a rift in their friendship. JJ's autism makes it difficult for him to fit in socially, but he has learnt to use magic tricks to make friends. His friends view him kindly but with a degree of amusement and sometimes irritation, but he knows Cook and Freddie will always take care of him. He is the kindest of the three, and by far the least worldly.Katie (Megan Prescott) and Emily Fitch (Kathryn Prescott) are very different identical twin sisters. Katie thinks of herself as something of a WAG and wants to usurp Effy's place as queen bee of the group. Katie's homophobic attitudes cause problems between them, as Emily comes to terms with her homosexuality. The quieter of the two, Emily is used to being in her sister's shadow. She is sulky but perceptive. She is in love with Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless), a fiery, politically charged and passionate young woman with idealistic views and an abundance of ambition. Emily also develops a good friendship with JJ, becoming close confidantes to one another.Other characters include Karen Mclair (Klariza Clayton), Freddie's sister who is desperate to become famous.[5] Mackenzie Crook guest stars as Johnny White, a psychotic Bristol gangster with comedians Jordan Long and Justin Edwards as his inept henchmen.[6] Ardal O'Hanlon is the gang's careless Northern Irish college tutor, Kieran MacFoeinaiugh (pronounced Mac-Phew). As with the first generation, the central cast's parents are played by established British comedic actors. Harry Enfield and Morwenna Banks return as Effy's parents, with Banks' real life partner David Baddiel appearing as her fictional husband's work colleague. Sally Phillips is introduced as Pandora's mother Angela, and Maureen Lipman as her Aunt Elizabeth. Other parents include Cook's father (Matt King) and mother (Tanya Franks), JJ's mother (Juliet Cowan) and father (Douglas Hodge), Freddie's dad (Simon Day) and grandfather Norman (Dudley Sutton), Naomi's mother (Olivia Colman), and Katie and Emily's parents played by impressionist Ronni Ancona and stand-up comedian John Bishop. Guest stars for the series include Georgia Henshaw, who appears as Lara, JJ's new girlfriend,[7] and singer Will Young who plays a school counsellor.[8] Chris Addison appears as Roundview College's new "Cameronian" headmaster, David Blood.[9] Pauline Quirke recurs as the detective who investigates Sophia's suicide.[10]Franky Fitzgerald (Dakota Blue Richards) is seen as an outsider, having arrived to her first year at Roundview three weeks late upon moving to Bristol from Oxford. She is an intelligent and creative girl, but is seen by others as strange, largely due to her androgynous dress sense. Alo Creevey (Will Merrick), something of an optimist, loves his dog and his van foremost. He is best friends with Rich Hardbeck (Alex Arnold), a boy from a very middle-class home who immerses himself in heavy metal subculture. He uses musical elitism as a means to cover up his own shyness around, among other things, girls.Mini McGuinness (Freya Mavor), Liv Malone (Laya Lewis), Grace Blood (Jessica Sula) are best friends. By the time Franky arrives, image-conscious Mini has already established herself as Roundview's new "queen bee". She obscures her own insecurities (such as her body image, and her virginity), and is cruel to Franky and others. Of her two friends, Liv is the more devoted to Mini, and is more worldly and sexually voracious. By contrast, Grace  sweet, kind, and positive in her outlook  begins to disassociate herself from Mini after seeing Franky's example, and in the first episode establishes a friendship with outsiders Franky, Alo and Rich. Mini's boyfriend is Nick Levan (Sean Teale). His popularity makes him something of a status symbol for Mini, but his feelings for her are shallow and uncomplicated. His brother Matty (Sebastian de Souza) has strained relationships with his family, engages in criminal behavior, and lives rough following an altercation with their father. In series six, the group befriend Alex Henley (Sam Jackson), who is gay and in particular forms a close friendship with Liv.Giles Thomas returns as Doug, Roundview's deputy headmaster as does comedian Chris Addison for a second and third year as headmaster David Blood. Josie Long returns in series six, once again as guidance counsellor. Gordon Kennedy plays English teacher Alan Precopp, and Alistair McGowan plays Coach Pooter, Nick's South African rugby coach.Episode one, "Tony", is an ensemble piece that introduces the characters and the format. We meet the effortlessly attractive, popular and intelligent Tony as he arranges for his friends to attend a party held by upper-class girl Abigail Stock (Georgina Moffat). The second episode, "Cassie", focuses on Cassie's final visit to an eating disorder clinic under the supervision of Abigail's mother Dr Stock. In her day-to-day life, she hallucinates messages instructing her to eat which seem to come from Sid, whom she develops feelings for. Jal's episode follows her attempt to win BBC Young Musician of the Year, and her strained relationship with her famous musician father. When a drug dealer 'Mad Twatter' smashes her clarinet as pay back for Sid not giving him money for drugs he bought, Jal's father sees to it he will not bother the gang again. In "Chris", Chris' mother abandons him, leaving 1,000 in cash. He blows the money on a party, and is eventually helped into temporary student accommodation by his psychology teacher, Angie (Siwan Morris). Episode five, "Sid", shows Sid's struggle with his parents' breakup while Tony organises a scheme to set him up with Michelle. A heartbroken and fragile Cassie attempts suicide by drug overdose."Maxxie and Anwar" focuses on the conflict between Anwar's Muslim faith and Maxxie's homosexuality. On a school trip to Russia, which Cassie does not attend as she is still in hospital, Michelle sees Tony trying to seduce Maxxie, because he wants to 'try something new'. In "Michelle", Michelle faces up to Tony's manipulative and cheating ways. She begins to date Josh Stock (Abigail's brother, played by Ben Lloyd-Hughes) until Tony breaks them up by sending naked photos of Abigail from Josh's phone. In "Effy", Josh seeks revenge on Tony and his younger sister Effy, by drugging her and effectively taking her for ransom. In the finale episode, it is Anwar's birthday. Anwar and Maxxie are reconciled when Anwar's father welcomes Maxxie to the birthday party, accepting his homosexuality. Chris's relationship with Angie ends violently when her fianc returns. Tony confesses to Michelle that he loves her and wants to change his manipulative ways (whilst on the phone), only to be hit by a bus, as Effy watches on from Sid's dad's car. The characters begin to sing "Wild World" by Cat Stevens as Tony lies unconscious and Sid searches for Cassie.The second series premiered on E4 on 11 February 2008, however the first episode was available in four parts to MySpace users prior to airing. "Maxxie and Tony" starts the series, showcasing Tony's impairments following his accident and Maxxie's involvement to his recovery. The episode also reveals more about Maxxie's life; we learn of his ambitions to be a dancer, his surname, his difficulties with homophobic bullies, and encounter his parents (played by Bill Bailey and Fiona Allen). The second episode introduces a new character in Maxxie's stalker, young carer Lucy, also known as "Sketch". Sketch disrupts the school play organized by drama lecturer Bruce (Shane Richie) in order to steal a kiss from Maxxie. To spite Maxxie, Sketch begins a sexual relationship with Anwar. Episode three focuses on Sid's life, coping with Cassie's departure to Scotland, and he suspects her of cheating. When his Scottish relatives visit, his father is driven to despair, drinking and smoking himself to death unintentionally. Sid reconnects with brain-damaged Tony when he is able to open up to him about the incident. For "Michelle", the group go on a camping trip to Michelle's father's home in Wales. Maxxie discovers Sketch having sex with Anwar, and Sid sleeps with Michelle, starting a relationship; he comes home to find Cassie waiting for him. In "Chris", Chris agrees to start a job and Jal learns to start being more open to new things, and the two end up in a relationship. Although Chris cheats on her with Angie, they move back in together, and Jal discovers she is pregnant."Tony", directed by recurring actor Harry Enfield, sees Tony Stonem attend a university open day not long after taking an ecstasy tablet that awakens elements of his old personality. In a visual metaphor for Jungian psychology, a mysterious girl who is a projection of Tony's subconscious helps him conquer his mental impairments. His old self again, he confronts Michelle and Sid and tells them their relationship is "wrong". With the Stonem parents unable to run the house, Effy takes over in episode seven. She starts a new private school and befriends weird girl Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell), and resolves to solve her brother's and his friends' relationship problems. Cassie is hurting and turning to promiscuity, but through Effy's machinations, she and Sid get back together, as do Tony and Michelle. Actor Daniel Kaluuya wrote "Jal", which sees her struggle with her pregnancy, while Chris is rushed to hospital with a blood clot in his brain. Meanwhile, Maxxie introduces his new boyfriend, James (Sean Verey). In "Cassie", Jal tells Chris she is having an abortion. Cassie feels without her eating disorder and other problems, she is disempowered; she is traumatised when Chris dies in her arms of a subarachnoid haemorrhage and flees to New York City. In the series finale, the gang get their A Level results, collectively mourn Chris and eventually part ways, with Sid following Cassie to New York, Anwar moving with Maxxie and James to London, and Sketch left behind. The series ends with Effy in Tony's bed, reveling in the art work of emotions she has created as she claims her top place in their social world, and also as series' lead in the upcoming series.We are introduced to the new cast on their first day at Roundview College in the series premiere, "Everyone". JJ Jones, James Cook and Freddie Mclair are best friends to begin with; twins Katie and Emily Fitch know Naomi Campbell from school but are distant with her because Katie is homophobic and suspects her of being a lesbian. The gang meet Effy, and sidekick Pandora; Katie wants to become Effy's best friend, and both Cook and Freddie are instantly smitten. Cook passes the test set by Effy and begins a casual sexual relationship with her. Episode two focuses on Cook who invites the whole group over, but their friendships are not very strong yet; chaos ensues, and Cook angers local gangster Johnny White (Mackenzie Crook). Thomas Tomone is only introduced in the third episode. He is an immigrant from the Congo, and develops a crush on Pandora. He endears himself to the group when he is able to get Johnny White off their backs by besting him in a pepper-eating competition. However, despairing at his decadent life in Bristol, Mrs. Tomone brings Thomas back to the Congo. In "Pandora", Pandora's innocent slumber party becomes an MDMA-fuelled rave after Katie spikes the brownies. Emily and Naomi kiss; Naomi denies being gay, but urges Emily to admit that she is, who also denies it. Pandora allows Cook to take her virginity, but regrets it when later Thomas returns from the Congo.Freddie's episode shows his difficult relationship with his widower father (Simon Day) and his sister Karen (Klariza Clayton), who has ambitions to be a celebrity. His father converts Freddie's shedhis personal sanctuaryinto a dance studio for Karen. He witnesses Effy's parents' breakup, discovers that Cook slept with his sister, gets punched in the face by his father, and when he goes to tell Effy how he feels about her discovers she is with Cook. In "Naomi", Naomi runs against Cook for student president on the basis that if he wins she will have to sleep with him; when he wins however, he does not force her to take it further than kissing. She and Emily begin a sexual relationship, but Naomi is unwilling to accept the reality of its romantic nature. In "JJ", Freddie and Cook's feud over Effy negatively affects JJ. At Emily's encouragement, he manages to confront them both about it, and later loses his virginity when Emily decides to have pity sex with him. Thomas discovers that Pandora has been cheating on him, and while high on JJ's medication, Cook reveals to Freddie that Effy loves Freddie and not him. In Effy's episode, she has nothing: her Queen Bee status has been usurped by Katie, sex with Cook means nothing, and her home life is a wreck. She finally feels something when she has sex with Freddie, but after being tormented by Katie, an intoxicated Effy hits her with a rock. Katie is recovering in "Katie and Emily" but her relationship with her sister is falling apart. However, at the college ball, Emily is able to assert herself and Naomi confesses she loves Emily back. Thomas and Pandora also reunite. The finale, "Cook, Effy and Freddie," sees Cook and Effy hiding out with Cook's father (Matt King). JJ tracks them down however, and forces Effy to confess it is Freddie that she loves, but Cook is adamant he loves her too. Freddie closes the series, asking "What do we do now?".Series four begins with the suicide of a girl named Sophia (Amberley Gridley) while she is high on MDMA at a club Thomas works at. A police inspector (Pauline Quirke) questions the entire gang, and Thomas is expelled by the new headmaster (Chris Addison) for his unseemly connection to the incident. Thomas gives into temptation and sleeps with another girl, resulting in the breakup of him and Pandora. In "Emily", Emily's mother (Ronni Ancona) warns her to take her relationship more slowly and cautiously. Emily discovers Naomi had slept with Sophia and is the one who sold her the MDMA, leaving their relationship fraught. In "Cook", Cook is in trouble for an assault and, to be a better influence on his younger brother, accepts a prison sentence for dealing the drugs that led to Sophia's death, covering for Naomi. When Katie loses her job and discovers she has premature menopause, she cannot confide in her mother at first because of the stress of their bankruptcy and homelessness; the Fitches are forced to move into Naomi's house.Freddie worries over Effy's psychological state in his centric episode, as she is developing a psychotic depression that resembles what his mother had before she committed suicide. He is able to save Effy after an attempt on her life; she is hospitalised and he is left desolate. JJ's episode sees him fall in love with a single mother called Lara (Georgia Henshaw), through whom he finds a new-found confidence and begins to doubt whether he really needed to be so highly medicated his whole life. In the penultimate episode, Effy's psychiatric counsellor Dr. John Foster (Hugo Speer) uses unorthodox hypnotic methods to cure Effy's depression, making her forget and want to abandon her old friends. After an incident at the spot of Tony's accident where she nearly commits suicide again, her psychosis comes back and Freddie insists Dr Foster cease treating Effy. Later, Foster lures Freddie to discuss Effy, and brutally murders Freddie with a baseball bat. In the finale episode, everyone deals with Freddie's absence, thinking that he has left of his own volition. Naomi and Emily finally repair their damaged relationship, scorched by cheating, and Naomi confesses she loved Emily since they first met; Thomas and Pandora are thrown back together by chance when they both get into Harvard College; a mostly-recovered Effy holds Freddie's birthday party in his shed, knowing that he loved her and pining for his return. Cook, who is on the run from the police after breaking out of prison, uncovers Dr Foster's killing and after confronting him, furiously lunges at Foster. The series ends here in freeze-frame leaving both Cook's and John Foster's fates unknown.The series begins by introducing unconventional newcomer Franky, to whom secretly insecure popular girl Mini takes a dislike; Mini ingratiates Franky into her group only to disown her. Franky is on the verge of breakdown, her adoptive father's air revolver in hand, when mysterious stranger Matty convinces her of her self-worth. Mini's sweet friend Grace establishes new friendships with Franky and the school's other outsiders, metalhead Rich and farmhand Alo. In episode two, "Rich", Grace finds herself drawn to Rich. She attempts to help him win over an elusive girl, and eventually he gets past his shyness to realise his attraction to her too. After Mini's fashion show in "Mini", the two agree to begin dating. Mini, however, feels pressured to have sex with boyfriend Nick, who does not know she is a virgin. Mini's cruelty to Grace and her new friends backfires when her fashion show goes completely awry. When she realises that her best friend Liv has slept with Nick, she forces herself to have sex with him, which is disappointing. She is devastated to see the parallel between her and her promiscuous mother (Clare Grogan) as they encounter one another on their walks of shame. The affair between Nick and Liv continues, though they both suspect Mini knows when she unifies the two groups of friends under Liv's roof for a party, in "Liv". Because she cannot handle the stress of her family life or Mini's scheme, Liv leaves the house. In town, she meets drifter Matty, and the pair embark on a drug-fuelled bender. Back at her house, she discovers that Matty is in fact Nick's brother, and Liv's affair with Nick comes out in the open. The brothers reconcile, however, and Matty comes home again.In "Nick", Matty is re-enlisted at Roundview, but his relationship with Liv causes a new love triangle to formbetween him, Liv and Franky. Having lost both Mini and Liv, and now living in Matty's shadow, Nick has a nervous breakdown and smashes up his house with a golf club. Through Matty, however, Nick comes to see his father Leon (Dorian Lough) and his parenting in a more negative light and the two brothers take a stand. In his episode, Alo's parents take him out of sixth form to work on the farm, and after he causes an explosion they sell all of his belongings. In protest, he throws a massive party and when he confronts his parents, his father suffers a heart attack. Rather than burden his friend Rich, who has just proudly had sex for the first time with Grace, he goes home and attempts to repair things with his parents. In "Grace", Grace introduces Rich to her parents; Rich is shocked to discover that her father is headmaster David Blood (Addison). Blood schemes to have Grace's grades slip on her drama assessment, a staging of Twelfth Night, so that he can justify removing her from Roundview. Grace sees her dilemma, as peacemaker, through Hamlet's sea of troubles soliloquy; she uses Twelfth Night to bring the love triangle between Matty, Liv and Franky to a head, and ultimately receives an A. After Blood still forces Grace to change schools, Rich is inspired by Romeo and Juliet and proposes to her. In the series finale, the two attempt to marry in secret with the gang as witnesses, though Alo's van breaks down. Mini begins to recognise her attraction to Franky, and becomes very protective of her. After an attempt at sex with Matty, Franky has a panic attack, charges through a forest, and accidentally falls over a ledge. After being rescued by Mini, Matty and Liv, Franky reveals more to her friends about her insecurities. Though Blood intervenes and Grace and Rich do not marry, they are happily allowed to continue dating and the gang, solidified as friends, party together at a local fte.Series 6 starts with the gang on holiday in Morocco; Franky has lost her virginity to Matty but is already becoming bored, and is tempted by wealthy drug dealer Luke (played by Joe Cole). Mini also decides to take Alo's virginity and swears him to secrecy. Matty pursues Luke and Franky which quickly escalates into a car chase; his truck overturns, putting Grace in a critical condition, and he runs away to avoid being arrested for the possession of the marijuana and ketamine Luke placed inside his vehicle. Back in Bristol, Franky struggles to cope with her guilt and Rich is prevented by her father from seeing Grace in hospital, where she lies in a coma, in "Rich". When Mr Blood takes Grace for treatment in Switzerland, Rich squats in the Bloods' home for some time, convinced that Grace is still alive, but after a party at the house a mournful David Blood informs him that Grace has subsequently died. In "Alex", new kid Alex, who is a little strange, arrives while the gang are at odds still mourning Grace; Liv in particular develops feelings for him, only for him to disclose to her that he is in fact gay. Nevertheless, they form a close in bond, particularly as Mini remains distant from Liv. In her episode, Franky, overwhelmed with guilt, escapes to "bad boy" Luke for companionship and excitement. Her actions are negatively viewed, and she quickly becomes alienated. She turns against authoritative figures at school and at home, pushing her to get more involved in her violent and destructive relationship with Luke. During a full-blown fight at a bar, Nick saves Franky and quietly confesses he loves her. After Luke gets rough with her, Franky escapes to a park near home where her father meets her; he is there to fend Luke away when he returns in an attempt to win Franky back. Subsequently, in "Mini", Mini continues to distance herself from her friends after Grace's death, while continuing her "no-strings-attached" relationship with Alo, but is hit further by the revelation that she is pregnant with Alo's baby. To get away from it, she clings to her deadbeat dad, Gregory, who she is convinced has changed. Though he abandons her, with the support of Franky she is able to accept her pregnancy.In "Nick", Nick struggles to find money to pay for Russian gangsters to smuggle Matty back into England, all the while struggling with his feelings for Franky. After emotionally pouring his heart out to her during an argument in a nightclub toilet, he subsequently blows the deal. But, to his happiness, Franky finally reciprocates his feelings, and they form a relationship. In "Alo", Alo is finally forced to grow up when, in his effort to put his failed relationship with Mini behind him, he has sex with a girl named Poppy Champion (Holly Earl) who he did not initially know to be underage. Poppy reports him to the police when he breaks up with her. Although charges are eventually dropped, he and Mini are forced further apart than ever before. "Liv" focuses on Liv's isolation. Since meeting Alex, she has been "dealing" with Grace's death by going out, partying, drinking, and staying at Alex's house instead of her own home. Alex leaves Bristol one weekend, and Liv finds thataside from her sister Maudeshe has truly drifted from her friends, and Mini in particular. Moreover, she begins to have intense pains and feels a large lump on her side, which she worries might be ovarian cancer. Ultimately however, the lump turns out to be a grief-induced hallucination; responding to this, Liv takes a step towards dealing with Grace's death by placing flowers next to her tombstone alongside Rich, Doug, and Maude. While Mini's mum tries to convince her to give her child for adoption once it is born, and Franky is conflicted after Matty returns to Bristol, in "Franky & Mini", both girls decide to leave everything behind and abscond. Soon, however, Mini wishes to return home, despite Franky's insistence. Alo learns of Mini's pregnancy and to her surprisein the endvows to take care of her no matter what. In the finale, Franky attempts to track down her mother, but instead finds her biological sister who declares their mother has died. At Alex's house party to celebrate leaving Bristol behind, she tells both Matty and Nick she loves them but cannot be with them. In the conclusion, Mini goes into labour, while Franky's sister takes her to see her motherwho is not dead after all. Nick and Matty bond once again, and the latter turns himself into the police. In the final scene, playing in parallel, Alex leaves Bristol for Thailand; Alo and Liv are beside Mini as she gives birth; Franky lays eyes on her mother; and Rich, outside the room where Mini is giving birth, looks at the camera and says "bye."Skins series 7 will air in spring 2013. Skins 7 will see the return of former Skins stars Hannah Murray as Cassie, Jack O'Connell as Cook and Kaya Scodelario as Effy in three individual stories. Lily Loveless as Naomi and Kathryn Prescott as Emily will also return in guest roles. The three stories will have their very own titles: SKINS PURE (Cassie's story), SKINS RISE (Cook's) and SKINS FIRE (Effy's).SKINS PURE (by Bryan Elsley) Cassie (Hannah Murray) is adrift, alone and invisible in London, trying to make sense of her life. Slowly she realises that someone is following her. Cassie turns towards the unknown. A strange and poignant friendship is carved out of mutual loneliness, but can it survive exposure to the real world?SKINS RISE (by Jamie Brittain) Cook (Jack O'Connell) has a job delivering drugs to Manchester revellers. When he is asked to help his employer's girlfriend find a house and finds that he is irresistibly attracted to her, he sets off a train of events which will lead him into a world of savage revenge and a confrontation with his own violent past.SKINS FIRE (by Jess Brittain) Effy (Kaya Scodelario) has a dead end job as a receptionist for a leading London Hedge Fund. But as she stumbles across crucial financial information relating to a troubled deal and embarks on an affair with her wealthy boss, she finds out that she has bitten off more than she can chew. Her flatmate Naomi (Lily Loveless) tries to stop Effy from ruining her life, but Effy cannot be reached; until tragedy strikes.Although Skins aired in the United States on BBC America (only series 1-3 aired and the rights cleared only for those series for purchase of DVDs or online viewing in the U.S.), albeit in an edited form (strong language bleeped out and some more graphic scenes of violence and sex cut out), MTV announced that they would be adapting the show into an American version set in Baltimore, Maryland.[11] With Bryan Elsley as executive producer,[11] the series began filming in February 2010 in Toronto, Canada. The first episode of the U.S. series is almost a shot-for-shot copy of the first episode of the UK series, but it deviates from the original plot in following episodes such that there are significant differences between the U.S. and UK versions. Characters are also similar, and some names have been changed; Sid has been renamed Stanley, Cassie renamed Cadie and Jal renamed Daisy. In addition, Tony's younger sister Effy, who becomes a main character in Generation Two of UK Skins, was renamed Eura. However, the biggest change comes in the form of Tea, a lesbian cheerleader who replaces the UK gay character Maxxie who was a professional dancer.[12]The show's cancellation was announced by MTV on 10 June 2011. The Parents Television Council, an advocacy group, criticized the show, calling it one of the worst shows a child could watch.[13] Reasons cited for its cancellation included loss of advertising sponsors and a shrinking audience, with fewer people tuning in for each subsequent episode. Pre-adult teens ("minors" under U.S. law), who are MTV's core demographic audience, were at the center of the argument for those who disapproved of the program, even with MTV's self-imposed restrictive broadcaster-like standards and practices. On 21 February 2012, every series of the UK version were made available on Hulu, with Hulu Plus subscribers viewing new shows the same week.The show's writing team has an average age of 21, and includes several "teenage consultants". Elsley said, "It's all about the writing. [...] We're about letting our audience feel they are not alone. [...] We're always having people miss [writing] meetings because they've got A-levels or even GCSEs".[14]In January 2011, Brittain announced a writing competition open to the public to help with the developing and writing of Series 6. According to Brittain, the winner will receive "a four month placement in the Skins writers' room, where you'd be invited to attend at least 10 of our top secret meetings, working with [Brittain] and the other Skins writers," as well as monetary compensation.[15] The winners of the 2011 competition were Sophie Boyce (18) and Joe Hampson (21). The winner of the 2008 competition, Dan Lovett, went on to become an official member of the Skins writing team.[15]The show is filmed almost entirely in Bristol; scenes at Roundview College were shot at Henbury School for series four, having formerly been set at the John Cabot Academy and SGS WISE Campus.[16] and multiple scenes are located around College Green.[17] Special locations for individual episodes have included the Gower Peninsula, Sharpness Docks, the University of Exeter and New York City. The series was shot entirely in High Definition, using Sony HDW-750P cameras for the first two series, and Sony HDW-F900R thereafter, both supplied by Panavision.[18] It was edited at BBC Studios and Post Production in Bristol, using Autodesk Lustre and Autodesk Smoke.[19] "The trip to Russia" episode was actually shot in Lithuania, near the capital Vilnius. This episode was shot in cooperation with Lithuanian Film Studios and professional Lithuanian actors.It was announced in April 2008 that all of the original cast (except Kaya Scodelario and Lisa Backwell) will be replaced for series 3.[20] Creator Bryan Elsley said: "There are risks associated with dumping a cast, but we just did it. There was some disquiet at the channel, but then they told us just to go with it." Speaking at Broadcast's television drama conference, he also confirmed the show would stick to its pattern of introducing college-age characters, moving them on in the next series, then letting them go. "The first year is about getting to know the kids, and the second gives us the advantage of being able to explore their psyches a little more," said Elsley. Brittain said that the new cast would be quite different from the original characters, although people may still spot some similarities. Open auditions for the second generation of cast members were held in Bristol, which attracted 1,500 16- to 18-year-olds, followed by a further two days of auditions in London.[21]A variety of videos have been released on the Skins website, including character profiles, and "Unseen Skins" mini-episodes that interweave with every aired episode.[22] In addition to character profiles on the official E4 website, accounts for the lead Skins characters are maintained on popular social networking website MySpace. Each series is launched on MySpace, with previews of the first episodes a few days before they are aired on television.[23] There is also an official Skins Internet bot for Windows Live Messenger, which allows users to receive automated messages throughout the airing of each episode with music credits, trivia, and behind-the-scenes gossip.[24]The first series received positive reviews, although some critics complained that the series depicts teenagers unrealistically and stereotypically.[25] Others criticised the excessive promotion of the show (specifically in the UK) and having relatively mediocre writing in comparison to other similarly themed shows. Actor Nicholas Hoult defended the extreme storylines, saying they would not reflect "everyone's teenage life", adding "it is maybe heightened for entertainment but all of it is believable."[26]Marieke Hardy expressed admiration of the show, and particularly enjoyed the fact that the show was "beautiful and sad and poignant and perfectly hurtful", while also managing to give impression of being drama that is "edgy, funny and rude".[27] However, she did state that she was unsure whether the show was meant for teenagers or not.[28] Stewart Lee has remarked during an interview on the BBC4 programme Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe that he feels lucky for having been a teenager watching TV for teenagers in the 1970s and not the 2000s as "there was something really comforting for nerds and weirdos about programmes like Children of the Stones and The Changes." He said that watching Skins as a teenager today would make him feel lonelier than he already would have been.[29] However, Brooker himself gave the programme a positive review in his Guardian column "Screen Burn", and specifically stated that "the series had wrong-footed me", comparing his initial expectation of Skins as a shallow show to after he had finished watching the series.[30]In his book Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale, Russell T Davies and his co-author, Benjamin Cook, discuss Skins at length, with Davies praising the show's innovation in a genre that was fast becoming tired and out of date. They are critical of some elements of the first series, such as the believability of Tony's character, or episode 6 which is described as "Carry On Russia", but give high praise to the second series as a whole, highlighting the death of Sid's dad as a superb moment, and calling the finale "perfect". Davies, creator of the award-winning Queer as Folk, also praised the handling of the show's homosexuality-related storylines, saying that he knew a boy very like Maxxie in the 80s.[31] The Age called it a "refreshing, entertaining and worthy series" and wrote it was "compulsory viewing for parents of teenagers as much as for teens."[32] Similarly, the "Naomily" storyline of Series 3 and 4 proved popular with lesbian viewers; a poll conducted by American gay women's' media website AfterEllen.com ranked Naomi and Emily as the top two fictional lesbian and bisexual characters.[33]The pilot episode of Skins averaged 1.5 million viewers.[41] The ratings for the second series which launched peaked at 884,000 viewers, which gave it 5.9% audience share and taking 60% of the 1624 demographic, however this was still more than 500,000 viewers down on its series one premiere.[42] The series finale attracted an audience of 740,000 on E4, equating to a 4.65% share of the audience.[43] The start of the third series drew in 877,000 viewers,[44] proving popular with its key audience demographic of younger people  56.2% of viewers were aged between 16 and 34.[45] Series 4 premiered with 1.5 million viewers across E4 and E4+1, the highest rated episode since series 1.[46][47]The programme has given rise to the term 'Skins party', referring to a debauched night of heavy drinking and recreational drug use.[48] During the 2007 Easter holidays, a girl in County Durham threw a house party; it was advertised on her Myspace profile as a "Skins Unofficial Party," referring to the party in the first series' trailer, with the subtitle "Let's trash the average family-sized house disco party." Two hundred people turned up, breaking into the house and causing over 20,000 of seemingly deliberate damage. She alleges that her account was hacked and someone else placed the ad.[49][50] Similar incidents have taken place in the Republic of Ireland, with major household damage and theft of personal property being reported in Firhouse and Foxrock. Although these attacks have not been conclusively linked to the show, news outlets have reported that they are called Skins parties.[51] Club nights marketed as 'Skins Secret Parties' have also taken shape in Leicester and Brighton.[52] Following this, a series of parties were run by Company Pictures in spring 2008.[53]In May 2009, E4 confirmed that Film4 and Company Pictures were in "preliminary talks" about a movie spin-off.[61] In March 2010, Jack Thorne revealed to The Guardian that the Skins motion picture was in pre-production.On 31 May 2011, after many whisperings about whether the movie would go ahead or not, Kaya Scodelario announced on Twitter "I genuinely don't know anything about that, have no idea if it's even happening." Scodelario continued by saying "I would still love to do the Skins movie" and that she would enjoy working with the cast again.[62]In September 2009, Company Pictures announced that the Skins brand has been licensed to Crystal Entertainment.[63] The plan is to help creator Bryan Elsley expand the brand into areas such as film, fashion and music. They described Skins as "the most authentic teen brand on TV".[63]In January 2010, Hodder & Stoughton published Skins: The Novel (ISBN 1-4449-0004-8), a short novel by Ali Cronin that describes events taking place between series 3 and 4,[64] and in March 2011, they published Skins: v. 2: Summer Holiday (ISBN 978-1444903096), a short novel by Jess Britain which centres around the series 5 cast.[65]Skins at TV.com1 Cast and characters

The series airs on Sunday evenings on the American cable network AMC and is produced by Lionsgate Television. It premiered on July 19, 2007, concluded its fifth season on June 10, 2012, and has been renewed for a sixth season.[1]Mad Men is set in the 1960s, initially at the fictional Sterling Cooper advertising agency on Madison Avenue in New York City, and later at the newly created firm Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.[2] The focal point of the series is Don Draper (Jon Hamm), creative director at Sterling Cooper and a founding partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, and the people in his life, both in and out of the office. The plot focuses on the business of the agencies as well as the personal lives of the characters. As such, it regularly depicts the changing moods and social mores of 1960s America.Mad Men has received critical acclaim, particularly for its historical authenticity, visual style, costume design, acting, writing, and directing, and has won many awards, including fifteen Emmys and four Golden Globes. It is the first and only basic cable series to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, winning it in each of its first four seasons in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.[3]In 2000, while working as a staff writer for Becker, Matthew Weiner wrote the first draft for the pilot of what would later be called Mad Men as a spec script.[4][5] Television producer David Chase recruited Weiner to work as a writer on his HBO series The Sopranos after reading the pilot script in 2002.[4][6] "It was lively, and it had something new to say," Chase said. "Here was someone [Weiner] who had written a story about advertising in the 1960s, and was looking at recent American history through that prism."[6] Weiner set the pilot script aside for the next seven years during which time neither HBO nor Showtime expressed interest in the project[4][5]until The Sopranos was completing its final season and cable network AMC happened to be in the market for new programming.[6] "The network was looking for distinction in launching its first original series," according to AMC Networks president Ed Carroll, "and we took a bet that quality would win out over formulaic mass appeal."[4][7]Tim Hunter, the director of a half-dozen episodes from the show's first two seasons, called Mad Men a "very well-run show." He said:[8]The pilot episode was shot at Silvercup Studios and various locations around New York City; subsequent episodes have been filmed at Los Angeles Center Studios.[9][10] It is available in high definition for showing on AMC-HD and on video-on-demand services available from various cable affiliates.[11] The writers, including Weiner, amassed volumes of research on the period in which Mad Men takes place so as to make most aspects of the seriesincluding detailed set designs, costume design, and propshistorically accurate,[5][6][12] producing an authentic visual style that garnered critical praise.[13][14][15] Each episode has a budget between $22.5 million, though the pilot episode's budget was over $3 million.[4][5] On the scenes featuring smoking, Weiner stated: "Doing this show without smoking would've been a joke. It would've been sanitary and it would've been phony."[12] Since the actors cannot, by California law, smoke tobacco cigarettes in their workplace, they instead smoke herbal cigarettes.[4][12] Robert Morse was cast in the role of senior partner Bertram Cooper; Morse starred in two 1967 films about amoral businessmen, A Guide for the Married Man (1967), a source of inspiration for Weiner,[6] and How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying (1967), in which Morse recreated his role from the 1961 Broadway play of the same name, (and which was itself based on a satiric novel by a former executive at the now-defunct New York ad agency, Benton & Bowles, Inc.).[16]Weiner collaborated with cinematographer Phil Abraham and production designers Robert Shaw (who worked on the pilot only) and Dan Bishop to develop a visual style that was "influenced more by cinema than television."[10] Alan Taylor, a veteran director of The Sopranos, directed the pilot and also helped establish the series' visual tone.[17] To convey an "air of mystery" around Don Draper, Taylor tended to shoot from behind him or would frame him partially obscured. Many scenes set at Sterling Cooper were shot lower-than-eyeline to incorporate the ceilings into the composition of frame; this reflects the photography, graphic design and architecture of the period. Alan felt that neither steadicam nor handheld camera work would be appropriate to the "visual grammar of that time, and that aesthetic didnt mesh with [their] classic approach"accordingly, the sets were designed to be practical for dolly work.[10]According to a 2011 Miller Tabak + Company estimate published in Barron's, Lions Gate Entertainment receives an estimated $2.71 million from AMC for each episode, a little less than the $2.84 million each episode costs to produce.[18]In March 2011, after negotiations between the network and the series' creator, AMC picked up Mad Men for a fifth season, which premiered on March 25, 2012.[19] Weiner reportedly signed a $30 million contract which will keep him at the helm of the show for three more seasons.[20] A couple of weeks later, a Marie Claire interview with January Jones was published, noting the limits to that financial success when it comes to the actors: "We dont get paid very much on the show and thats well-documented. On the other hand, when you do television you have a steady paycheck each week, so thats nice."[21]Sales from home video and iTunes could amount to $100 million in revenue during the show's expected seven-year run, with international syndication sales bringing in an additional estimated $700,000 per episode.[18] That does not include the $71[18] to $100 million[22] estimated to come from a Netflix streaming video deal announced in April 2011.The opening title sequence features credits superimposed over a graphic animation of a businessman falling from a height, surrounded by skyscrapers with reflections of period advertising posters and billboards, accompanied by a short edit of the instrumental "A Beautiful Mine" by RJD2. The businessman appears as a black-and-white silhouette. The titles, created by production house Imaginary Forces, pay homage to graphic designer Saul Bass's skyscraper-filled opening titles for Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (1959) and falling man movie poster for Vertigo (1958); Weiner has listed Hitchcock as a major influence on the visual style of the series.[12] David Carbonara composes the original score for the series. Mad Men  Original Score Vol. 1 was released on January 13, 2009.In a 2010 issue of TV Guide, the shows opening title sequence ranked #9 on a list of TV's top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.[23]At the end of almost all episodes, the show either fades to black or smash cut to black as period music or a theme by series composer, David Carbonara, plays during the ending credits; at least one episode ends with silence or ambient sounds. A few episodes have ended with more recent popular music, or with a diegetic song dissolving into the credits music. The Beatles authorized the use of "Tomorrow Never Knows" for the season 5 episode "Lady Lazarus", and the same track was used over the closing credits. It marked a rare instance where the band licensed their music for a television series. Lionsgate, which produces Mad Men, paid $250,000 for the use of the song in the episode.[24] Bob Dylan's "Don't Think Twice It's Alright" ended the last episode of Season 1.In addition to having created the series, Matthew Weiner is the show runner, head writer, and an executive producer; he contributes to each episodewriting or co-writing the scripts, casting various roles, and approving costume and set designs.[4][5] He is notorious for being selective about all aspects of the series, and promotes a high level of secrecy around production details.[4][5] Tom Palmer served as a co-executive producer and writer on the first season. Scott Hornbacher (who later became an executive producer[9]), Todd London, Lisa Albert, Andre Jacquemetton, and Maria Jacquemetton were producers on the first season. Palmer, Albert, Andre Jacquemetton, and Maria Jacquemetton were also writers on the first season. Bridget Bedard, Chris Provenzano, and writer's assistant Robin Veith complete the first season writing team.Albert, Andre Jacquemetton, and Maria Jacquemetton returned as supervising producers for the second season. Veith also returned and was promoted to staff writer. Hornbacher replaced Palmer as co-executive producer for the second season. Consulting producers David Isaacs, Marti Noxon, Rick Cleveland, and Jane Anderson joined the crew for the second season. Weiner, Albert, Andre Jacquemetton, Maria Jacquemetton, Veith, Noxon, Cleveland and Anderson were all writers for the second season. New writer's assistant Kater Gordon was the season's other writer. Isaacs, Cleveland and Anderson left the crew at the end of the second season.Albert remained a supervising producer for the third season but Andre Jacquemetton and Maria Jacquemetton became consulting producers. Hornbacher was promoted again, this time to executive producer. Veith returned as a story editor and Gordon became a staff writer. Noxon remained a consulting producer and was joined by new consulting producer Frank Pierson. Dahvi Waller joined the crew as a co-producer. Weiner, Albert, Andre Jacquemetton, Maria Jacquemetton, Veith, Noxon and Waller were all writers for the third season. New writer's assistant Erin Levy, executive story editor Cathryn Humphris, script co-ordinator Brett Johnson and freelance writer Andrew Colville complete the third season writing staff.Alan Taylor, Phil Abraham, Jennifer Getzinger, Lesli Linka Glatter, Tim Hunter, Andrew Bernstein, and Michael Uppendahl are regular directors for the series. Matthew Weiner directs the season finales. Cast members John Slattery and Jon Hamm have also directed episodes.As of the third season, seven of the nine writers for the show are women, in contrast to Writers Guild of America 2006 statistics that show male writers outnumber female writers by 2 to 1.[25] As Maria Jacquemetton noted:[25]Mad Men focuses mostly on Don Draper, although it features an ensemble cast representing several segments of society in 1960s New York. Mad Men places emphasis on recollective progression as a means of revealing the characters' past.[26]Mad Men depicts parts of American society and culture of the 1960s, highlighting cigarette smoking, drinking, sexism, feminism, adultery, homophobia, and racism.[12][45] There are hints of the future and the radical changes to come in the 1960s. Themes of alienation, social mobility and ruthlessness also underpin the tone of the show. MSNBC noted that the series "mostly remains disconnected from the outside world, so the politics and cultural trends of the time are illustrated through people and their lives, not broad, sweeping arguments."[46] Creator Matthew Weiner called the series science fiction in the past, reasoning that just as science fiction uses a future world to discuss issues that concern us today, Mad Men uses the past to discuss issues that concern us today that we don't discuss openly.[47]Mad Men has become the subject of much gender-based discussion. The show presents a subculture in which men, many of whom are engaged or married, frequently enter sexual relationships with other women. Most of the main characters have strayed outside of their marriages.[48]Marie Wilson, in an op-ed for The Washington Post said that "it is difficult and painful to see the ways in which women and men dealt with each other and with power. It's painful because this behavior is not as far back in our past as we would like to think. Our daughters continually get the messages that power still comes through powerful men. And unfortunately being pretty is still a quality that can get you on the ladder - though it still won't take you to the top."[49]The Los Angeles Times said that "the sexism, in particular, is almost suffocating, and not in the least fun to watch. But it's the force against which the most compelling female characters struggle, and the opposition that defines them. The interaction with everyday misogyny and condescension  the housewife whose shrink reports to her husband, the ad woman who's cut out of the after-hours wheeling and dealing  gives the characters purpose and shape."[50]In Salon, Nelle Engoron explained that while Mad Men seems to illuminate gender issues, its male characters get off "scot-free" for their drinking and adultery, while the female characters are often punished.[51]One columnist for Ms., Aviva Dove-Viebahn argues that "Mad Men straddles the line between a nuanced portrayal of how sexism and patriarchal entitlement shape lives, careers and social interactions in the 1960s (and, by extension, today) and a glorified rendering of the fast-paced, chauvinistic world of 1960s advertising and all that comes with it."[52]Melissa Witkowski, writing for The Guardian, argued that Peggy's ascendancy was marred because the show "strongly implies that no woman had ever been a copywriter at Sterling Cooper prior to Peggy, but the circumstances of her promotion imply that this was merely because no woman had ever happened to have shown talent in front of a man before," pointing out that Peggy's career path bore little resemblance to the stories of successful ad women of the time such as Mary Wells Lawrence and Jean Wade Rindlaub.[53]ABC News noted that "as the show's time frame progressed into the 1960s, series creator Matthew Weiner didn't hold back in depicting a world of liquor-stocked offices, boozy lunches and alcohol-soaked dinners." One incident in Season 2 finds advertising executive Freddy Rumsen losing his job after urinating on himself. Don, Betty, Herman 'Duck' Phillips, and Roger Sterling were singled out by television reporters for their excessive drinking. ABC News also quoted an addiction specialist who said that "over the last ten years, alcoholism has been more fully understood as a disease. But in the sixties, bad behavior resulting from heavy drinking could be considered 'macho' and even romantic, rather than as a compulsive use of alcohol despite adverse consequences."[54] One reviewer called the fourth season a "sobering tale of drunken excess" as the Don Draper character struggled with his addiction to alcohol.[55]The Los Angeles Times opined that Mad Men excels at "stories of characters fighting to achieve personal liberation in the restless years before the advent of the full-blown culture wars."[50] One reviewer was excited that the fourth season, through Peggy, brought "the introduction to the Counterculture (Andy Warhol as the King of Pop and Leader of the Band), with all the loud music, joint-passing, underground movies so present in those times. Peggy's visit to a loft, with a Life Magazine photo editor-"friend", placed her squarely in the center of the exciting creativity so rampant in the underground and also so rebellious against the mainstream." The Huffington Post focused on one scene where "Peggy joins her new beatnik friends in the lobby while Pete stays behind with the SCDP partners to relish in his newly captured $6 million account. As they embark on their opposite trajectories, the camera lingers on their knowing glances. Here is where we find emotional truth."[56]Television commentators have noted the series' study of personal identity, most significantly through Don Draper's identity fraud during the Korean War in which he took on another soldier's identity to get out of the war. Tim Goodman has said that the overriding theme of Mad Men is identity. Goodman called Don Draper "a man who's been living a lie for a long time. He's built to be a loner. And over the course of three seasons we've watched him carry this existential angst through a fairy-tale life of his own creation."[57]Gawker noted that "Not only is the agency of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce in the business of spinning themor at least warping the truthto sell product, but the main character, Don Draper, is built on a lie. Just like one of his campaigns, his whole identity is a sweet fabrication, a kind of candy floss spun out of opportunity, innuendo, and straight-up falsehood."[58]The New Republic writer Ruth Franklin said that "The shows method is to take us behind the scenes of the branding of American iconsLucky Strike cigarettes, Hilton hotels, Life cerealto show us not how the products themselves were created, but how their very sexy  very magical images were dreamed up." She went on to say that "In this way, we are all Don Drapers, obsessed with selling an image rather than tending to what lies underneath. Drapers fatal flaw is his lack of psychological awareness: He is at once perfectly tuned in to the desires of America and entirely out of touch with his own character".[59] One reviewer said that "Identity is a key theme in 'Mad Men, and nobody is ever quite who they appear to be. Each one is filled with thwarted ambitions and frustrated dreams, none more so than Don Draper himself, whose closet, it's gradually revealed over seasons one and two, is filled with proverbial skeletons."[60]The San Francisco Chronicle has argued that the character of Don Draper is racist, stating, "Unless Don Draper was out marching for civil rights, and hired black interns or had a black girlfriend, its fantasy to think Draper wasnt racist. Indeed, it would be inaccurate to the period to present him as not having racist views, yet achieving that level of success."[61] Change.org said, "the very absence of people of color in the main narrative of this show speaks volumes. To be clear, Mad Men is not about the mid-20th century. If it were, the show would deserve criticism for not making race a driving issue. But Mad Men is about Don Draper and the people in his orbitmiddle- to upper-class white Americans living and working around Manhattan in the late '50s to mid-'60s. For these people, race and racism are largely invisible, until and unless the struggle for equality impinges upon their privilege."[62]It has been argued that the show distorts history by erasing the stories of the successful men and women of color of 1960s-era Madison Avenue such as Clarence Holte, Georg Olden, and Caroline Robinson Jones.[53] Latoya Peterson, writing for Slate's Double X, argues that Mad Men isn't confronting racial issues, but glossing over them.[63] The Root's Michael Ross points out that the continued lack of black admen is rapidly becoming ahistorical.[64]However, Slate writer Tanner Colby wrote an article praising the show's treatment of race and Madison Avenue as historically accurate, especially the storyline in the third season episode "The Fog" in which Pete Campbell's idea to market certain products specifically towards African-Americans is struck down by the company. Slate also referred to the fourth season episode "The Beautiful Girls," where Peggy Olson suggests Harry Belafonte as a spokesman for Fillmore Auto after Fillmore Auto faced a boycott for not hiring black employees. Don shoots down the idea. Colby also pointed to an expose published in a 1963 copy of Ad Age that revealed that "out of over 20,000 employees, the report identified only 25 blacks working in any kind of professional or creative capacity, i.e., nonclerical or custodial." Colby said that "Mad Men isnt cowardly for avoiding race. Quite the opposite. Its brave for being honest about Madison Avenues cowardice."[65]Smoking, far more common in the United States of the 1960s than it is now,[66] is featured throughout the series; many characters can be seen smoking several times in the course of an episode.[12] In the pilot, representatives of Lucky Strike cigarettes come to Sterling Cooper looking for a new advertising campaign in the wake of a Reader's Digest report that smoking will lead to various health issues including lung cancer.[67] Talk of smoking being harmful to health and physical appearance is usually dismissed or ignored. In the fourth season, Draper writes an advertisement in The New York Times called "Why I'm Quitting Tobacco" that announces Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce's refusal to take tobacco accounts. The finale finds the agency working for the American Cancer Society.The actors themselves do not smoke real cigarettes, however. Creator Matthew Weiner disclosed in an interview with The New York Times that the reason was not overly about the actors' health: "You don't want actors smoking real cigarettes", Weiner said. "They get agitated and nervous. I've been on sets where people throw up, theyve smoked so much". There is also the issue of California (where the series is filmed) forbidding smoking tobacco in the workplace.[4]Viewership for the premiere at 10:00 pm on July 19, 2007, was higher than any other AMC original series to date.[68] The premiere attracted 900,000 viewers.[69] The numbers for the first season premiere were more than doubled for the heavily promoted[70] second season premiere.[71] A major drop in viewership for the episode following the second season premiere prompted concern from some television critics.[70][71]However, the second season finale posted significantly higher numbers than the series' first season finale, and was up 20% over the season two average. 1.75 million people viewed the second season finale of Mad Men. The cumulative audience for the episode was 2.9 million viewers, when the two re-broadcasts at 11:00 pm and 1:00 am were factored in.[72]The third season premiere, which aired August 16, 2009, gained 2.8 million views on its first run, and 0.78 million with the 11:00 pm and 1:00 am repeats. In 2009, Mad Men was second in Nielsen's list of Top 10 timeshifted primetime TV programs, with a 57.7% gain in viewers, second only to the final season of Battlestar Galactica.[73]The fourth season premiere of Mad Men was the most watched-episode in AMC history until the series premiere of the AMC original series The Walking Dead, clocking in at 2.9 million viewers, up five percent from the ratings for Season Three's debut and up 61 percent from the third season average.[74]The fifth season premiere, "A Little Kiss", was the most watched-episode of Mad Men of all-time to date, receiving 3.5 million viewers and 1.6 million viewers in the 1849 demographic. Before the fifth season, Mad Men had never achieved above a 1.0 in the 1849 demographic. Charlie Collier, AMC's president, said that "For each of the five Mad Men seasons Matthew Weiner and his team have crafted a beautifully told story and each season a larger audience has responded; a rare accomplishment. We couldnt be more proud of this program, the brilliant writers, cast and crew, and the entire team on each side of the camera."[75] The fifth season finale, "The Phantom", was watched by 2.7 million viewers, the highest ratings for a Mad Men season finale to date.[76]Mad Men has received high critical acclaim since its premiere.[79] The American Film Institute selected it as one of the 10 best television series of 2007,[80] 2008,[81] 2009,[82] and 2010.[83] and it was named the best television show of 2007 by the Television Critics Association[84] and several national publications, including the Chicago Tribune, The New York Times, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, TIME Magazine, and TV Guide.[85] On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season scored 77/100,[86] the second season scored 88/100,[87] the third season scored 87/100,[88] the fourth season scored 92/100,[89] and the fifth season scored 88/100.[90]A New York Times reviewer called the series groundbreaking for "luxuriating in the not-so-distant past."[45] The San Francisco Chronicle called Mad Men "stylized, visually arresting [...] an adult drama of introspection and the inconvenience of modernity in a man's world."[13] A Chicago Sun-Times reviewer described the series as an "unsentimental portrayal of complicated 'whole people' who act with the more decent 1960 manners America has lost, while also playing grab-ass and crassly defaming subordinates."[91] The reaction at Entertainment Weekly was similar, noting how in the period in which Mad Men takes place, "play is part of work, sexual banter isn't yet harassment, and America is free of self-doubt, guilt, and countercultural confusion."[92] The Los Angeles Times said that the show had found "a strange and lovely space between nostalgia and political correctness."[93] The show also received critical praise for its historical accuracy mainly its depictions of gender and racial bias, sexual dynamics in the workplace, and the high prevalence of smoking and drinking.[6][14][93][94]The Washington Post agreed with most other reviews in regard to Mad Men's visual style, but disliked what was referred to as "lethargic" pacing of the storylines.[95] A review of the first season DVD set in the London Review of Books by Mark Greif was much less laudatory. Greif stated that the series was an "unpleasant little entry in the genre of Now We Know Better" as the cast was a series of historical stereotypes that failed to do anything except "congratulate the present."[96] In a February 2011 review of the show's first four seasons, critic Daniel Mendelsohn wrote a critical review that called Mad Men a "drama with aspirations to treating social and historical issuesthe show is melodramatic rather than dramatic. By this I mean that it proceeds, for the most part, like a soap opera, serially (and often unbelievably) generating, and then resolving, successive personal crises (adulteries, abortions, premarital pregnancies, interracial affairs, alcoholism and drug addiction, etc.), rather than exploring, by means of believable conflicts between personality and situation, the contemporary social and cultural phenomena it regards with such fascination: sexism, misogyny, social hypocrisy, racism, the counterculture, and so forth."[97]Mad Men is one of U.S. President Barack Obama's favorite television shows.[98][99] Obama sent a personal letter praising the series to creator Matthew Weiner.[100]With Mad Men, Weiner and his creative team have "received critical acclaim for its historical authenticity and visual style"[101] although opinions on Mad Men vary among people who worked in advertising during the 1960s.According to Robert Levinson, a consultant for Mad Men who worked at BBDO from 1960 to 1980, "what [Matthew Weiner] captured was so real. The drinking was commonplace, the smoking was constant, the relationships between the executives and the secretaries was exactly right".[4] Jerry Della Femina, who worked as a copywriter in that era and later founded his own agency, said that the show is accurate in its depiction of "the smoking, the prejudice and the bigotry".[4]Conversely, Allen Rosenshine, a copywriter who went on to lead BBDO, called the show a "total fabrication", saying "if anybody talked to women the way these goons do, theyd have been out on their ass".[102] George Lois, who worked at Doyle Dane Bernbach for a year before starting his own ad agency in 1960, said "Mad Men is nothing more than the fulfillment of every possible stereotype of the early 1960s bundled up nicely to convince consumers that the sort of morally repugnant behavior exhibited by its characters... is glamorous and vintage....[U]nlike the TV 'Mad Men,' we worked full, exhausting, joyous days: pitching new business, creating ideas, "comping" them up, storyboarding them, selling them, photographing them, and directing commercials. And our only 'extracurricular activity' was chasing fly balls and dunking basketballs on our agency softball and basketball teams!"[103]According to an analysis of the language used in Mad Men by Benjamin Schmidt, a visiting graduate fellow at the Cultural Observatory at Harvard University, the vocabulary and phrases used in the show are not all quite authentic to the period despite attempts to use period specific vocabulary. Using a computer program, he determined that the show uses relatively few words that are clearly anachronistic, but that there are many words and phrases used that are far more common in modern speech than in the speech of the era ("need to", "feel good about", "euthanize" etc...). In aggregate these words and constructions give a misleading impression of the speech patterns of the time. He notes particularly that the use of modern business language, (leverage, signing bonus, etc..) unknown or little used at the time "creeps in with striking regularity."[104]Mad Men has been credited with setting off a wave of renewed interest in the fashion and culture of the early 1960s. According to The Guardian in 2008, the show was responsible for a revival in men's suits, especially suits resembling those of that time period, with higher waistbands and shorter jackets; as well as "everything from tortoise shell glasses to fedoras".[105] According to the website BabyCenter, the show led to the name "Betty" soaring in popularity for baby girls in the United States in 2010.[106]New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley wrote that the success of Mad Men had turned "the booze-guzzling, chain-smoking, babe-chasing 1960s" into "Broadways decade du jour", citing three 1960s-set musicals that had appeared on Broadway in 2010 and 2011: revivals of Promises, Promises and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, and a new musical, Catch Me If You Can.[107] Brantley also wrote, "Im presuming that Mad Men is the reason this Promises, Promises is set not in the late 60s, as the original was, but in 1962."[108]The 2009 TNT series Trust Me, which ran for one season, was set at a modern-day advertising agency; television critic Tom Shales called it a cross between Mad Men and Nip/Tuck. Two network television series that premiered in 2011, Pan Am and the short-lived The Playboy Club, both set in 1963, have frequently been referred to as imitations of Mad Men.[109][110]Don Draper's rendition of the Frank O'Hara poem 'Mayakovsky' from Meditations in an Emergency, at the end of episode one of season two, led to the poet's work entering the top 50 sales on Amazon.com.[93]The appearance of actress Christina Hendricks as office manager Joan is said to have sparked a renewed interest in a voluptuous look for women, and to be partly responsible for, among other things, a 10% increase in breast implant surgery in Britain in 2010.[111]The nostalgia for the fashions and social norms of the early 1960s engendered by Mad Men has been criticized by some commentators. Amy Benfer, writing in Salon, asked, "But isnt it a little odd that a show that, among other things, warns about the dangers of seeing the past in too amber a light has spawned an industry devoted to fetishizing nostalgia for that same flawed past?"[112] Anna Kelna, in Ms. Magazine, wrote, "Mad Men itself might ascribe [sic] to the feminist agenda, but thanks to its pervasive impact on pop culture, the show is crafting a whole new generation of would-be Bettys (Drapers stylish wife) not Peggys (the shows ambitious career girl)."[113]Mad Men is the recipient of many nominations and awards from various organizations, including the American Film Institute, Emmys and Creative Arts Emmys from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, a Peabody Award from the Peabody Board at the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, Satellite Awards from the International Press Academy, and British Academy Television Awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Numerous nominations and award has also been received from guilds and societies such as the Art Directors Guild, Casting Society of America, Cinema Audio Society, Costume Designers Guild, Directors Guild of America, Motion Picture Sound Editors, Producers Guild of America, Screen Actors Guild, Television Critics Association, and Writers Guild of America.Award highlights include winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series four times, for each of its first four seasons; its fourth win tied the record for serial dramas set earlier by Hill Street Blues (19811984), L.A. Law (1987, 19891991), and The West Wing (20002003).[114] In 2012 Mad Men set a record for the most Emmy nominations, 17, without winning.[115]Jon Hamm was the host of Saturday Night Live on October 26, 2008, during the show's 34th season. Mad Men was parodied on two skits in that episode. In one, "A-Holes: Pitch Meeting", Hamm is joined by two other Mad Men cast members in cameo appearances, Elisabeth Moss (who was called the morning of the show and asked to play Peggy, since Amy Poehler, who was set to play Peggy in the sketch, went into labor)[116] and John Slattery.[117] In another skit, "Don Draper's Guide to Picking Up Women," Hamm pokes fun at how easily his character seduces women.[118]The Simpsons' episode "Treehouse of Horror XIX", which first aired in the United States on November 2, 2008, included a segment called "How to Get Ahead in Dead-Vertising"[119] The segment, an adaptation of the Mad Men animated title sequence, was the "inspiration" of executive producer Al Jean; it featured a "rotund, lunchbox-carrying figure, undoubtedly Homer Simpson, enter[ing] a living room and then float[ing] past windows bearing Springfield-centric displays that include a Duff Beer ad," with the Mad Men theme music on the soundtrack.[119] On November 27, 2011, The Simpsons aired the episode, "The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants", once again parodying Mad Men. It featured Mad Men actor John Slattery and creator Matthew Weiner.The children's television show Sesame Street ran a child-friendly parody of Mad Men on November 11, 2009 (episode 4188). Muppet versions of Don Draper and two other advertising professionals are shown going on an "emotional rollercoaster," becoming "mad," "sad" and "glad," as they sort through pictures of an ad campaign featuring a cartoon bear.[120][121] When Miranda Barry of the Sesame Workshop was asked how such a parody is possible "given the drinking, smoking, and womanizing that's a big part of the AMC show", she compared it to their parody of Desperate Housewives: "You may have seen our parody called 'Desperate Houseplants.' It was about a houseplant not getting its needs met by the gardener. So it always works on two levels."[121]The April 2011 issue of Mad magazine included "Sad Men," written by Arnie Kogen and illustrated by Tom Richmond. The spoof ends with the ad agency landing a slew of promising new blue chip accounts in 1965: Johns Manville ("The king of asbestos!"), the Hearst newspaper chain ("print will never die!"), Underwood ("Nothing will ever replace typewriters!"), Gimbels department store, and E.J. Korvette.In the Community episode "Physical Education", the character Abed, a television and movie connoisseur, does an impression of Don Draper, after his peers encourage him to change his personality. He practices a conversation with Annie (played by Alison Brie, who plays Trudy Campbell on Mad Men). He offers her cigarettes, while putting on a deep voice and a flirtatious charm. As Annie leans in to kiss Abed, he quickly turns away and says, "Don Draper from Mad Men". While many of his friends are impressed, Shirley shouts, "Don't be him! He cheats on his wife!"In the 30 Rock episode "The Moms", Liz Lemon's mother, Margaret, mentions working for Sterling Cooper after graduating from secretarial school. In the episode "The Ones", Kenneth Parcell has an allergic reaction to strawberries and says "My real name... is Dick Whitman." The television show House references Mad Men when Dr. Gregory House insults a high ranking man who works at a well-respected advertisement agency by calling him Don when his name is Dave. In late 2010, the TV show Arthur had a parody of Mad Men in the episode "Nicked by a Name," using a character named Tom Taper instead of Don Draper. In the fifth episode of the second season of The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret, it is revealed that Jon Hamm (who guest stars on the show) is playing himself and needs to return home as Mad Men begins filming shortly. A five-minute parody entitled "Malt Men" features actors Ryan Ridley and Eric Price as characters who advertise malt liquor beverages, and appears on Channel 101, a monthly short-film festival in Los Angeles.[122]The comedy website Funny or Die has a small series of skits entitled MA Men which transplants the show into present-day South Boston and invariably involves creating ad campaigns for various Boston businesses in which certain members of Boston's professional sports rivals are sodomized. Comedian Rob Delaney plays Draper, Joey McIntyre plays Roger, Nate Corddry plays Campbell, Jessica Chaffin plays Joan, Jamie Denbo plays Peggy, Nat Faxon plays Salvatore, and Michaela Watkins plays Trudy.[123] Comedy website CollegeHumor released an animated short called "Alternate Mad Men Intros" for the release for the fifth season.[124]In promotions for the series, AMC aired commercials and a behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of Mad Men before its premiere. The commercials mostly show the one (usually brief) sex scene from each episode of the season. The commercials, as well as the documentary, featured the song "You Know I'm No Good" by Amy Winehouse.[12] The documentary, in addition to trailers and sneak peeks of upcoming episodes, were released on the official AMC website. Mad Men was also made available at the iTunes Store on July 20, 2007, along with the "making of" documentary.[125]For the second season, AMC undertook the largest marketing campaign it had ever launched, intending to reflect the "cinematic quality" of the series.[126] The Grand Central Terminal subway shuttle to Times Square was decorated with life-size posters of Jon Hamm as Don Draper, and quotes from the first season.[126] Inside Grand Central, groups of people dressed in period clothing would hand out "Sterling Cooper" business cards to promote the July 27 season premiere.[126] Window displays were arranged at 14 Bloomingdale's stores for exhibition throughout July, and a 45' by 100' wallscape was posted at the corner of Hollywood and Highland in downtown Hollywood.[126] Television commercials on various cable and local networks, full-page print ads, and a 30-second trailer in Landmark Theaters throughout July were also run in promotion of the series.[126] Television promotions for the second season featured the song "The Truth" by Handsome Boy Modelling School.[127]The advertising campaign for the fifth season of Mad Men was conceived by the network as a way to promote the series after the 17-month break between seasons. A teaser campaign began in which posters, using images of the enigmatic "falling man" from the opening credits, were spread out on buildings in New York and Los Angeles. The New York Times ran a story about the image's similarity to the 9/11 falling man image. Some 9/11 family members accused the campaign of being insensitive. However, one family member accused the paper of creating a "kerfuffle where none exists", as well as using 9/11 family members to "write a story that refers only to your own feelings". AMC responded with a statement that said, "The image of Don Draper tumbling through space has been used since the show began in 2007 to represent a man whose life is in turmoil. The image used in the campaign is intended to serve as a metaphor for what is happening in Don Drapers fictional life and in no way references actual events."[128]The advertising campaign also included the use of posters that proclaimed "Adultery Is Back." The Atlantic Wire criticized the AMC campaign, saying "Not that we're some creaky old traditionalists who value monogamy above all else, but making that of all things the selling point for a brilliant, beautiful show seems a little silly."[129]Promotion for Seasons 4 and 5 saw Mad Men and AMC partnering with Banana Republic for the Mad Men Casting Call, in which users submit photos of themselves in Mad Men style and one winner receives the opportunity for a walk-on role in an upcoming season.[130] Promotion for Seasons 3 and 4 included Mad Men Yourself, an interactive game in which the user can choose clothing and accessories for an avatar similar to the appearance of Mad Men characters, drawn in the sixties-inspired style of illustrator Dyna Moe.[131] Mad Men Cocktail Culture was also featured, an iPhone app that challenges users to create the perfect drink as featured in Mad Men episodes.[132] Another interactive game launched prior to Season 3, the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce Job Interview, allowed users to answer questions based on various scenarios and then offered them a position in the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce office.[133] Season 3 also included Which Mad Man Are You?, an interactive game in which users could find out which Mad Men character they were most like based on their answers to questions about various work and life situations.[134] Users can take trivia quizzes based on the years in which the Mad Men episodes take place[135] and find recipes for 1960s-era drinks on the Mad Men Cocktail Guide.[136] AMC's Mad Men website also features exclusive sneak peek and behind the scenes videos, episodic and behind-the-scenes photo galleries, episode and character guides, a blog, and a community forum.Inspired by the iconic Zippo brand, the DVD box set of the first season of Mad Men was designed like a flip-open Zippo lighter. Zippo subsequently developed two designs of lighters with "Mad Men" logos to be sold at the company headquarters and online.[137] The DVD box set, as well as a Blu-ray disc set, was released July 1, 2008; it features a total of 23 audio commentaries on the season's 13 episodes from various members of the cast and crew.[138]For the third season, the clothing store Banana Republic partnered with Mad Men to create window displays at its U.S. stores, showing clothing inspired by the fashion of the show. The store also ran a "casting call" competition, in which participants were asked to mail photos of themselves in period fashion for a chance at a walk-on part in the show;[139] two winners were announced in October 2010.[140]Another clothing promotion from the series' third season includes a "Mad-Men Edition" suit offered by American clothing retailer Brooks Brothers.[141] The suit is designed by the show's costume designer, Janie Bryant, and is based on an actual style sold by Brooks Brothers in the early 1960s.[141]In spring 2010, Mattel released a series of limited-edition collectible Barbie and Ken dolls based on the characters Don and Betty Draper, Joan Holloway, and Roger Sterling.[142]The fourth season saw the announcement of a collaboration between Janie Bryant and Californian-based company, Nailtini, to produce a limited-edition line of Mad Men nail polish. The four shades are entitled Bourbon Satin, French 75, Deauville and Stinger and are reported to have been inspired by the fabrics used to make cocktail dresses in the 1960s. The Mad Men nail polish line went on sale in the U.S. in late 2010.[143]Mad Men has integrated product placement into its narratives. For instance, in a second season episode, the beer manufacturer Heineken is seen as a client seeking to bring its beer to the attention of American consumers. This placement was paid for by Heineken as an additional part of their advertising on the show. The closing episode of season two was broadcast (for its premiere) in the United States with only one brief commercial interruption: a short ad for Heineken beer.[144]On June 20, 2007, the consumer-rights activist group Commercial Alert filed a complaint with the United States Distilled Spirits Council alleging that Mad Men sponsor Jack Daniel's whiskey was violating liquor advertising standards since the show features "depictions of overt sexual activity" as well as irresponsible intoxication.[145] Jack Daniel's was mentioned by name in the fifth episode.During the fourth season, Unilever created a series of six retro commercials to be aired during the show in the United States. The ads are set at the fictional Smith Winter Mitchell advertising agency and take place during the same time period as Mad Men. The products used in the ads are Dove, Breyers, Hellman's, Klondike, Suave, and Vaseline.[146][147]Some sources attribute other mentions of real life products on the show, such as ads worked on by the firm, or companies sought as clients including Utz potato chips, Maidenform, Gillette, American Airlines, Clearasil and others to product placement[148]In an interview for the Archive of American Television on November 12, 2010, creator and showrunner Matthew Weiner stated that there is much less product placement on Mad Men than is commonly perceived, and that most real products featured (including Cadillac and Utz) are included for purposes of realism, with no product placement deals behind them. Weiner said: "There is very little [product placement], and it is an illusion propagated by the network. It never works out... Literally I've named four things in four seasons and there have probably been a hundred products on the show. Half of them are made up, no one's paying to be on the show."[149]Weiner added that he is not opposed to product placement, provided that it could increase the show's budget or eliminate the advertising breaks. However, he says that the limited product placement in the show has been a frustrating experience for his creative team. Because of these frustrations, Weiner anticipates no product placement deals in future seasons. "I can say here and now, never again".[150] Weiner also expressed his regret at his inability to edit Mad Men's Wikipedia article to correct the misperception that real products on the show are the result of product placement deals.[151]Mad Men at TV.comJon HammElisabeth MossVincent KartheiserJanuary JonesChristina HendricksJared HarrisBryan BattMichael GladisAaron StatonRich SommerMaggie SiffKiernan ShipkaJessica ParChristopher StanleyJay R.

He is a hard-drinking, chain-smoking executive with a shadowy past who has achieved success in advertising. He was married to Elizabeth "Betty" Draper and has three children with her, but his history of infidelity, along with his revelations to her about his past led to their separation at the end of season 3 and eventual divorce.[4][27] Draper's real name is Richard "Dick" Whitman;[28][29] during the Korean War, he assumed the identity of Lieutenant Don Draper, who was killed in front of Whitman. Draper was due to be sent home, so by switching dog tags with Draper, Dick found a way to escape his rural, traditional family.[30]Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss): Olson rises from being Draper's secretary to being a copywriter with her own office.[31] She becomes pregnant with Pete Campbell's child, a pregnancy that neither she nor her family or coworkers seem to notice, until she goes to the emergency room due to illness, and they tell her she is in labor.[32] Campbell is unaware of her pregnancy until the end of season 2, when Peggy tells him that she gave the baby up for adoption.[33] In season 3, Peggy is approached by Duck Phillips to leave Sterling Cooper, but turns him down, despite the fact that his persistence leads to a romantic relationship. While he rarely acknowledges it, Don appreciates Peggy's abilities, leading him to choose her to go with him to Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. She is given more freedom to come up with her own creative advertising ideas, with Don always pushing her to be better. During season five, Peggy felt increasingly unappreciated and patronized by Draper. In the episode "The Other Woman", she leaves SCDP to accept an offer to become head copywriter at Cutler, Gleason, and Chaough.Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser): A young, ambitious account executive from an old New York family with connections and a privileged background. Campbell tries to blackmail Don Draper with the Dick Whitman information he has learned, but it doesn't work. Don and he are antagonistic some of the time, but later develop a grudging respect for each other, culminating in Don's approaching Pete over Ken Cosgrove when forming a new agency.[30] Campbell and his wife, Trudy, were unable to conceive a child early in their marriage, and he only learned of his child with Olson at the season 2 finale. At the end of season 3, dissatisfied with his treatment at Sterling Cooper regarding a promotion, he secretly plans to leave the firm. Unaware of this, Don Draper approaches Campbell with an offer to join his new firm as long as Pete brings accounts worth $8 million of cash flow. Campbell decides to join Draper, with the condition that he be made a partner, though his surname does not appear in the new firm's name (Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce). Campbell is one of the few characters in the show who does not smoke. He looks up to Don in many ways. Campbell is often shown cheating on his wife, and is not above manipulating and blackmailing women to get them to sleep with him.Betty Francis (ne Hofstadt, formerly Draper) (January Jones): Don Draper's ex-wife and mother of their three children, Sally, Bobby, and Eugene Scott. Raised in the Philadelphia suburb of Elkins Park, Pennsylvania and a graduate of Bryn Mawr College, she met Don when she was a model in Manhattan and married him soon thereafter. At the start of the series, they have been married for seven years (19531960) and live in Ossining, New York. Over the course of the first two seasons, Betty gradually becomes aware of her husband's womanizing.[4] After a brief separation, Betty allows Don to return home when she learns she is pregnant with their third child, but first has a one-night stand of her own.[33] She leaves for Reno at the end of season 3, in December 1963, with the intention of divorcing Don. At the start of season 4, in November 1964, she has divorced Don and married Henry Francis.[34] She, the children, and her new husband move to Rye. Betty's relationship with her children is often strained, in particular with Sally.Joan Harris (ne Holloway) (Christina Hendricks): Office manager and head of the secretarial pool at Sterling Cooper. She had a long-term affair with Roger Sterling until his two heart attacks caused him to end the relationship. In season 2, she becomes engaged to Dr. Greg Harris. By season 3, they are married and at Greg's request Joan quits her job at Sterling Cooper. Their marriage becomes tested when Greg's difficulties securing work as a surgeon force Joan to return to work at a department store, prompting her to call Roger Sterling to ask for his help in finding an office job. Because of her invaluable managerial skills, she is later hired for the new agency formed by Don, Roger, Bert and Lane. Meanwhile, Greg's desire to further his career as a surgeon leads him to obtain a commission in the Army, and early in season 4 he is sent to basic training and then to Vietnam. While her husband is deployed, Joan and Roger have one sexual encounter, which results in her becoming pregnant. Joan initially decides to terminate the pregnancy, but changes her mind and gives birth shortly before the beginning of season 5, with her husband unaware he is not the father. Greg returns from Vietnam during Season 5, but he and Joan separate and are divorced by the end of the season. By the close of Season 5, Joan has become a partner in SCDP.Roger Sterling (John Slattery): One of the two senior partners of Sterling Cooper, and one-time mentor to Don Draper. His father founded the firm with Bertram Cooper, hence his name comes before Cooper's in the firm's title. A picture in Cooper's office shows Roger as a child alongside Cooper as a young adult. In season 2, Bertram Cooper mentions that "the late Mrs. Cooper" introduced Sterling to his wife, Mona, whom Sterling is in the process of divorcing in favor of Don's former secretary, 22-year-old Jane.[31] Sterling, a World War II Navy veteran, was a notorious womanizer (living like he was "on shore leave"[35]) until two heart attacks changed his perspective, although they did not affect his drinking or smoking habits, which remained excessive. Prior to his marriage to Jane, Roger had a longstanding affair with Joan Holloway. In season 4, he and Joan have a brief romantic encounter, and Joan becomes pregnant. It was revealed in season 3 that sometime in the mid-1950s, when Don was a salesman at a furrier, and eager to break into advertising, Roger met him and through that connection Don was hired. Season 4 also has Roger less involved with the day-to-day activities at SCDP than he was at Sterling Cooper. His primary function is to manage the Lucky Strike account, which is responsible for over half of SCDP's billings. However, in the "Chinese Wall" episode, it is revealed that Lucky Strike is moving its account to a rival agency, forcing a dramatic downsizing of the firm.Lane Pryce (Jared Harris); recurring season three, regular season four and five: The English financial officer installed by Sterling Cooper's new British parent company. He first appears in the first episode of season 3. His role is that of a strict taskmaster who brings spending under control, in particular by cutting out frivolous expenses. His efforts are so successful he is to be sent to India to enact cost-cutting measures, a move which Pryce is not looking forward to making after having settled in with his wife and child in New York. An unfortunate accident at work handicaps his replacement, thus allowing Pryce to keep his current position. Pryce warms to American culture, and foresees some form of cultural and societal changes in his observations on American race relations. When Putnam, Powell, and Lowe is sold, he realizes he has become expendable, and negotiates to become a founding partner in the new agency alongside Don Draper, Bert Cooper, and Roger Sterling, Jr., with his firing all the employees who are going to go to the new firm, then getting fired himself, thus voiding the non-compete clauses in their contracts and freeing all of them to build a new firm. Pryce liquidates his portfolio in order to pay for his partnership in the new firm and is in financial difficulty while SCDP was establishing itself. He faces a crisis when Inland Revenue demanded immediate payment of his British back taxes. In order to pay the debt, Pryce secretly negotiates a $50,000 line of credit on behalf of the firm and announces to the partners that the SCDP has a $50,000 profit and is able to pay bonuses. In anticipation of the bonus, Pryce forges Draper's signature on an early bonus check to himself, and views it as a 13 day loan which will be made good once the bonuses are paid. However, the partners decide to forego their bonuses despite Pryce's pleading. In the penultimate episode of season 5, Cooper discovers the cancelled check and confronts Draper, who in turn confronts Pryce demanding his resignation. That weekend, Pryce types out a resignation letter and hangs himself in his office.Bertram "Bert" Cooper (Robert Morse); recurring seasons one through two, regular season three to present: The somewhat eccentric senior partner at Sterling Cooper. He leaves the day-to-day running of the firm to Sterling and Draper, but is keenly aware of the firm's operations. Bertram is a Republican. He is fascinated by Japanese culture, requiring everybody, including clients, to remove their shoes before walking into his office (which is decorated with Japanese art). He is a fan of the writings of Ayn Rand and implies he knows her personally. Among his eccentricities, Bert frequently walks through the offices in his socks and intensely dislikes gum-chewing and smoking (an oddity for the time, especially considering Lucky Strike cigarettes is a major client). He owns a ranch in Montana and is a widower with no children. Don approaches him about buying back the agency at the end of the third season, which evolves into their forming the new Sterling Cooper firm. In season 4, Don and Peggy stumble upon an audio tape recording of Roger Sterling's memoirs that reveals that Bert received a war injury to his groin, and that ultimately he was castrated by an incompetent doctor. Later in season 4, in the episode "Blowing Smoke", when the agency is forced to radically downsize its staff following the loss of the Lucky Strike account, Bert tells the others that he is quitting the business. He isn't seen for the rest of the season, but is back at work at the beginning of season 5.Kenneth "Ken" Cosgrove (Aaron Staton): A young account executive originally from Vermont. Outside the office, Ken is an aspiring author who had a short story published in The Atlantic, which is a source of some envy by his co-workers, particularly the competitive Paul Kinsey and jealous Pete Campbell. According to his bio in The Atlantic, Ken attended Columbia University.[36] He has one admirer, art director Salvatore, who secretly has a crush on him.[37] Ken was promoted in the beginning of season 3 to Account Director, a role he shared with Pete Campbell. Later on, the more easy-going Ken is promoted over the more ambitious Campbell to Senior Vice President of Account Services. However, at the end of season 3, Draper and Sterling choose Pete over Ken for their new agency. During season 4, Ken joins SCDP after working for McCann Erickson (which bought Sterling Cooper) and BBDO. When Pete learns of Ken's return, he is initially upset with Lane Pryce for not telling him, since Pryce had authorized Ken's previous promotion over Pete. However, when Ken agrees to serve under Pete as accounts manager at SCDP, the two reconcile over lunch and Pete comes to realize that Ken is a practical choice to help bring new business to the firm.Harold "Harry" Crane (Rich Sommer): A bespectacled media buyer and head of Sterling Cooper's television department, which is created at Harry's initiative. Unlike his mostly Ivy League fellows, Harry went to the University of Wisconsin. Harry joins his colleagues in drinking and flirtations, though he is a dedicated husband and father. However, he does have a drunken one-night stand with Pete's secretary in season 1, which leads to his being briefly kicked out of his home by his wife, Jennifer. He is ultimately coerced by Draper and Cooper into joining the new agency, although he realizes it is the right move. When Sterling Cooper was in the process of being sold, Harry mistakenly thinks they are considering opening a West Coast office and believes that he would be the person to move to California. Harry later becomes a bit of a braggart, who is overly fond of discussing his Hollywood connections. In season five he has abandoned his faithfulness to his wife as he discusses having affairs while abroad on business and is easily seduced by Paul's Hare Krishna girlfriend Lakshmi in his office.Sally Beth Draper (Kiernan Shipka); recurring seasons one through three, regular season four to present: The eldest child of Don and Betty Draper, her relationship with her mother is often strained. Sally is a minor character through the first two seasons, but assumes a larger role during the third season as she approaches adolescence. She forms a strong bond with her Grandpa Gene when he comes to live with the Drapers, and is devastated by his sudden death. She also becomes distraught when Don and Betty break the news that they are getting a divorce, reproaching her father for breaking his promise to always be there, and accusing her mother of making him leave. She also develops a relationship with Glen, a boy who lives down the street from her that her mother does not approve of. When Don marries Megan Calvet, Sally establishes a positive relationship with Megan. Sally's mom, Betty, is extremely jealous of this relationship and seeks to sabotage it.Megan Draper (ne Calvet) (Jessica Par); recurring season four, regular season five to present: Don's wife (as of the beginning of season 5) and a junior copy writer at SCDP. Following the death of Miss Blankenship, she takes over as Don Draper's secretary. In the season 4 finale, Don takes Megan on a trip to California to take care of his kids. In spite of being involved with Faye, a marketing research consultant who works with SCDP, he proposes marriage to Megan after returning from California and she accepts. In the episode "Lady Lazarus", she leaves the firm to pursue her dream of acting, and (with the help of Don) lands her first acting gig in one of SCDP's commercials by the season 5 finale. Don seems to be more honest with Megan than he was with Betty, apparently telling Megan about his secret identity between seasons 4 and 5. Megan is originally from Montreal, and French is her first language.Henry Francis (Christopher Stanley); recurring seasons three through four, regular season five to present: A political adviser with close connections to New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and the Republican Party, it is later revealed that he serves as the Director of Public Relations and Research in the Governor's Office. He is instantly infatuated with the six-months pregnant Betty Draper when he meets her at the Sterlings' Kentucky Derby party while she is waiting by the women's restroom. Later, as he is called upon by Betty Draper and some of her friends to use his influence to save a local reservoir, they develop a personal connection. Betty reciprocates Henry's attention because she increasingly feels no connection with Don due to his non-stop infidelities, lies over his true identity, and his dismissive and sometimes verbally abusive attitude towards her. After the death of Betty's beloved father, the much older Henry also serves as a replacement father-figure for her. Henry and Betty have only a few brief and furtive meetings before Henry proposes marriage in the wake of the Kennedy assassinations. Season 3 ends with the two of them on a plane with baby Gene, presumably flying to Reno so Betty can obtain a quick divorce from Don. At the start of season 4, we see that Henry and Betty have married and Henry has rather uncomfortably taken up residence in the Drapers' house, living with Betty and her three children and paying rent to Don. He tries to soothe Betty as she continues to react angrily to Don and his irresponsibility towards the children, but gets more fed up over time. Betty, on her part, feels unaccepted by Henry's family, especially when she is unable to control Sally during a family visit to Henry's mother's house. At the end of season 4, they decide to move to Rye, NY.Stan Rizzo (Jay R. Ferguson); recurring season four, regular season five to present: The art director at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Before coming to the company, he worked for Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 Presidential campaign. He and Peggy are often at odds with each other due to his abrasive attitude, although the two later develop a strong working relationship after Peggy challenges Stan over working in the nude for a campaign, which Stan gruffly concedes to her. Stan is one of the few members of the SCDP creative department who survives the staff cuts.Salvatore "Sal" Romano (Bryan Batt); regular seasons one through three: The Italian-American former art director at Sterling Cooper. Sal is a closeted homosexual. Reluctant to act upon his homosexuality, he twice avoided sexual encounters with different men. By 1962, Sal had married Kitty, who seems unaware of Sal's sexual orientation, yet begins to realize that something is amiss in their relationship.[37] The issue of being closeted for Sal is shown in brief but stark contrast against the newly evolving social attitudes toward homosexuality. Sal's secret crush on Ken Cosgrove comes uncomfortably and awkwardly close to being revealed during a dinner in Sal's apartment.[37] Later, when a recently hired young advertising exec, Kurt, casually announces his homosexuality, Sal remains painfully silent while his fellow co-workers speak disparagingly about Kurt.[38] In the premiere of season 3, Sal has a brief interrupted homosexual encounter with a hotel employee while in Baltimore, the end of which Don accidentally witnesses. Don, who was in the midst of a heterosexual encounter of his own at the same hotel, finesses this uncomfortable situation through a coded conversation about their current client, London Fog. He suggests the tagline "Limit your exposure." Later in season 3, Sal rebuffs the sexual advances of Lee Garner Jr., the drunken playboy son of Lucky Strike's founder and a key client. Angered by the rejection, the client demands Sal be removed from the campaign and Roger fires Sal in order to appease the client and keep his $25 million account. In a conversation right after the firing, Don shakes his head at Sal, saying "you people," implying that Don is not sympathetic to people who aren't able to put the company ahead of their personal preferences.[39] At the end of the episode, Sal is seen calling his wife Kitty from a phone booth (presumably in Central Park), in an area frequented by gay men cruising for sex. On the phone, Sal explains to Kitty he would be working late that night. Sal does not appear again during the rest of the third season, and does not appear in the fourth or fifth season.[40]Paul Kinsey (Michael Gladis); regular seasons one through three, guest star season five: A creative copywriter and Princeton University alumnus, the bearded, pipe-smoking Paul prides himself on his politically liberal views. At some indeterminate time, he had a relationship with Joan Holloway which ended badly, largely because Paul talked about it too much. Paul tried, unsuccessfully, to date Peggy soon after she was hired by Sterling Cooper.[41] Through most of the second season, Paul dated Sheila White, an African-American woman from South Orange, New Jersey. They broke up while in Oxford, Mississippi, where they had gone as Freedom Riders to oppose segregation in the South.[31] It is a source of pride for Kinsey to live in the low-income, southern section of Montclair, New Jersey. He is highly competitive, an attribute revealed to have soured a few friendships while he was in college, and which causes some friction with Peggy Olson, culminating in his becoming angry when Don chooses Peggy for the new agency over him. Paul did not appear after the third season finale until he reappeared in the tenth episode of the fifth season, revealing himself to Harry as a disciple of Krishna Consciousness.Rachel Katz (ne Menken) (Maggie Siff); regular season one, guest star season two: Is the Jewish head of a department store who becomes romantically involved with Draper after she comes to Sterling Cooper in search of an advertising agency to revamp her business's image. During the course of their affair, Don tells her things he has not shared with Midge Daniels or his wife. When Don is blackmailed by Pete Campbell, he comes to Rachel with the suggestion that they run away together to Los Angeles. She reminds him of his duty to his children, and questions whether he would want to abandon his children after having grown up without a father. When Don persists, Rachel comes to the realization that he didn't want to run away with her, he just wanted to run away. She calls him a coward. Their friendship seems to collapse from that point on. Don encounters her again in season 2 while out to eat with Bobbie Barrett, finding out that Rachel is now Mrs. Katz, having since married a man named Tilden Katz. Though it appears that Don is only momentarily shaken by the news of her marriage, several episodes later, after drinking heavily with Roger and Freddie Rumsen, he gives his name as "Tilden Katz" to a bouncer outside an underground club Roger is trying to get them into.Official websiteMad Men at the Internet Movie DatabaseThe template Tv.com is being considered for deletion.Mad Men at TVGuide.comSeeing History in Mad Men, an interactive timeline as of 2010 by The New York TimesCommunity television is a form of mass media in which a television station is owned, operated and/or programmed by a community group to provide television programs of local interest known as local programming.Community television stations are most commonly operated by non-profit groups or cooperatives. However, in some cases they may be operated by a local college or university, a cable company or a municipal government.Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication is promoting the advocacy with the government in relations to community Television with other organizations since its emergence from 2011. BNNRC has been addressing the Community Television access issue for over a decade, helping to bridge the information gap in BangladeshMost community channels in Canada are owned and operated by cable companies, as a requirement of license imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). However, due to the state of concentration of media ownership in Canada, whereby the vast majority of Canada's conventional television stations are now owned by national media conglomerates and offer very little locally oriented programming, terrestrial community channels began to emerge in the 2000s in many smaller markets not directly served by their own commercial television stations. Community channels of this latter type are generally operated by local non-profit groups.Community Television is in its infancy in Ireland. Licensing is administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. Saorview launched on 31 October 2010 giving an addition platform for Community television, however so far Community TV is only available on UPC's Irish cable and Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) network. The main broadcasters are P5TV (UPC 801), Cork Community TV (UPC 802) and DCTV (UPC 803). These groups produce content and then they can have it transmitted by an organisation that has a license to broadcast (Terrestrial television or Cable Television).As well as the above, there are also web based channels which are likely to become more dominant in the not too distant future as broadband coverage and quality improves (and as the technologies converge). Examples of these are Teilifis Gaeltacht Muscrai (TGM) based in the rural Irish speaking WestCork Gaeltacht, and Fingal Community TV based in Dublin.Public-access television is a form of non-commercial mass media where ordinary people can create content which can be viewed through cable TV systems. Public-access television is often grouped with Educational-access television and Government-access television (GATV) channels, by the acronym PEG.

The series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter pattern analyst for the fictional Miami Metro Police Department (based on the real life Miami-Dade Police Department) who moonlights as a serial killer. Set in Miami, the show's first season was largely based on the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay, the first of his Dexter series novels. Subsequent seasons have evolved independently of Lindsay's works. It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos, Jr., who wrote the first episode.In February 2008, syndicated reruns (edited down to a TV-14 rating) began to air on CBS, although the reruns on CBS ended after one run of the first season. The series has enjoyed wide critical acclaim and popularity. Season 4 aired its season finale on December 13, 2009 to a record-breaking audience of 2.6 million viewers, making it the most-watched original series episode ever on Showtime.[1] Michael C. Hall has received several awards and nominations for his portrayal of Dexter, including a Golden Globe. On November 18, 2011, it was announced that Dexter had been renewed for two more seasons.[2][3] Season 7 premiered on September 30, 2012.[4] Ratings released from the Season 7 premiere of Dexter show that the Season 7 premiere was the most watched Dexter episode ever with over 3 million viewers.[5] Executive producer Sara Colleton confirmed that Season 8 will be the show's last season,[6] and that they already know how the show is going to end.[7]Besides Michael C. Hall playing the title character, the show's supporting cast includes Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's adoptive sister and co-worker (and later boss) Debra, and James Remar as Dexter's adoptive father, Harry. Dexter's co-workers include Lauren Vlez as Lieutenant (later Captain) Mara LaGuerta, Dexter and Debra's supervisor, David Zayas as Detective Sergeant Angel Juan Marcos Batista, and C. S. Lee as lab tech Vince Masuka (promoted to title credits as of Season 2). Erik King portrayed the troubled Sgt James Doakes for the first two seasons of the show. Desmond Harrington joined the cast in Season 3 as Joey Quinn; his name was promoted to the title credits as of Season 4. Geoff Pierson plays Captain Tom Matthews of Miami Metro Homicide. Julie Benz starred as Dexter's girlfriend turned wife Rita in Seasons 14 with a guest appearance in Season 5. Rita's children Astor and Cody are played by Christina Robinson and Preston Bailey (who replaced Daniel Goldman after the first season). Dexter's infant son, Harrison, who is in Seasons 46 is played by Kruntchev twins, Evan and Luke.Notable appearances in Season 1 are Christian Camargo as the Ice Truck Killer and Mark Pellegrino as Rita's abusive ex-husband Paul. Jaime Murray portrayed Lila Tournay in Season 2, a beautiful but unhinged, know-it-all, British "artist" who becomes obsessed with Dexter. Keith Carradine, as Special FBI Agent Frank Lundy, and Jimmy Smits, as ADA Miguel Prado, each appeared in season-long character arcs in Seasons 2 and 3, respectively. David Ramsey, who plays confidential informant Anton Briggs in Season 3, returned in Season 4, romantically involved with Debra. John Lithgow joined the cast in season four as the "Trinity Killer". Carradine returned in Season 4, reprising his role as newly retired FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy, who was hunting the Trinity Killer. Courtney Ford was featured in Season 4 as an ambitious reporter who mixes business with pleasure, getting romantically involved with Joseph while simultaneously fishing for sources and stories. Julia Stiles joined the cast a little later as Lumen Pierce, a woman who gets involved in a complex relationship with Dexter after the tragedy that culminated the previous season. In the sixth season, Mos Def was cast as Brother Sam, a convicted murderer turned born-again Christian, and Edward James Olmos and Colin Hanks guest starred as Professor James Gellar and Travis Marshall who were involved in a murderous apocalyptic cult. The seventh season will feature multiple guest stars including Calista Flockhart, Ray Stevenson, Jason Gedrick, and Yvonne Strahovski.Brad William Henke had a role as amputee victim Tony Tucci in the first season. Margo Martindale had a recurring role as Camilla, a records office worker who was close friends with Dexter's adoptive parents. JoBeth Williams portrays Rita's suspicious mother, Gail Brandon, in four episodes of season 2. Malcolm-Jamal Warner appeared as a family lawyer, and John Marshall Jones appeared as a man who murdered his wife, to be shot by Doakes. Anne Ramsay portrayed defense attorney Ellen Wolf, Miguel's arch-nemesis. Valerie Cruz had a recurring role as Miguel's wife, Sylvia. April L. Hernandez joined the cast early into the fifth season as Cira Manzon, a police "uniform" who was included in an investigation by Debra because of her Hispanic descent and knowledge of Santa Muerte. In season 6, Billy Brown was cast as transferred-in Detective Mike Anderson to replace Debra after her promotion to Lieutenant, Josh Cooke plays Louis Greene, a lab tech and Masuka's intern and Aimee Garcia played the role of Batista's younger sister, Jamie.The main creative forces behind the series were executive producers Daniel Cerone, Clyde Phillips and Melissa Rosenberg; Cerone left the show after its second season. Coming off a record-setting Season 4 finale, executive producer and showrunner Clyde Phillips departed the series to spend more time with his family. 24 co-executive producer Chip Johannessen took over Phillips' post.[8] Head writer Melissa Rosenberg left after Season 4 as well.After the conclusion of Season 5, it was revealed that Chip Johannessen was departing the show after a single season[9] and that Scott Buck would be taking over as showrunner from season 6.Orphaned at the age of three due to the murder of his mother, Dexter Morgan is adopted by Miami police officer Harry Morgan and his wife Doris. After discovering that young Dexter has been killing neighborhood pets for several years, Harry tells Dexter that he believes the need to kill "got into" him at too early an age, and that he believes Dexter's need to kill will only grow. To keep Dexter from killing innocent people, Harry begins teaching Dexter "The Code": Dexter's victims must be killers themselves who have killed someone without justifiable cause and are likely to do so again. Dexter must also always be sure that his target is guilty, and thus, frequently goes to extreme lengths to get undeniable proof of his victim's guilt. Most importantly, Dexter must never get caught. Flashbacks throughout the series show Harry, who died several years before, instructing Dexter on how to fake human behavior, how to cover his tracks after a kill, and even how to stranglehold a target to knock them out and capture them.Dexter has followed The Code religiously to satisfy his "Dark Passenger" (the name he has assigned to his urge to kill). However, in season four, he hastily kills a photographer who then proves to be innocent. Like many serial killers, he keeps trophies; before dispatching a wrongdoer, Dexter makes an incision on their cheek with a scalpel and collects a blood sample, which he preserves on a blood slide. He stores his collection in a box concealed inside his air conditioner.In the beginning of the series, Dexter believes that he has no emotions, and he has to work non-stop to appear normal and blend in with the other people around him. Initially, Dexter is (with varying success) able to fake 'normal' emotions and maintain his appearance as an unremarkable friend and neighbor. He does maintain a few personal relationships early on, stating that he is "fond" of his adoptive sister Debra. She is unaware of Harry's training but harbors lingering jealousy of the perceived preferential treatment Harry gave Dexter. As part of his "disguise" in season one, Dexter dates a woman named Rita who is too traumatized from years of abuse at the hands of her ex-husband, Paul Bennett, to be intimate with Dexter. This suits Dexter, who believes getting intimate will reveal his darker side to Rita. He is fond of (and good with) children in general, particularly Rita's two children, Astor and Cody. However, his attachment to Debra, Rita, Astor and Cody, and later his biological son, Harrison, have all complicated his double life and made him question his "need" to kill.Dexter: Early Cuts is an animated web series that premiered on October 25, 2009.[10] Michael C. Hall reprises his role as the voice of Dexter.[11]KTV Media International Bullseye Art produced and animated the webisodes, working closely with Showtime for sound editing, Interspectacular for direction, and illustrators Kyle Baker, Ty Templeton, Andrs Vera Martnez, and Devin Lawson for creating distinctive illustrations. The webisodes are animated with 2.5D style, where flat 2D illustrations are brought to life in 3D space. The first season was created and written by Dexter producer/writer, Lauren Gussis. She was nominated for a Webby for her writing on the first season.The first web series precedes the current narrative of the show and revolves around Dexter hunting down the three victims that he mentions in the sixth episode of season 1, "Return to Sender". Each victim's story is split into four two-minute chapters.A second season of the web series titled Dexter: Early Cuts: Dark Echo, one story in six chapters, premiered on October 25, 2010. It was written by Tim Schlattmann and illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz and David Mack. The story begins immediately following Dexter's adoptive father Harry's death.[12][13]Although reception to individual seasons have varied, the response to Dexter has been mostly positive. The review aggregator website Metacritic calculated a score of 77 from a possible 100 for season 1 based on 27 reviews, making it the third-best reviewed show of the 2006 fall season. This score includes four 100% scores from the New York Daily News, San Francisco Chronicle, Chicago Sun-Times and People Weekly.[14] Brian Lowry, who had written one of the three poor reviews Metacritic tallied for the show, recanted his negative review in a year-end column for the trade magazine Variety after watching the full season.[15] On Metacritic Season 2 has a score of 85 with all 11 reviews positive. Season 3 has 78 with 13 reviews. Season 4 has 79 with 14 reviews. Season 5 has a score of 75 with 11 reviews,[16]. Season 6 has a score of 63 with 10 reviews. Season 7 has a score of 81 with 7 reviews.[17] While remarking on some of the show's more formulaic elements (quirky detective, hero with dense workmates, convenient plot contrivances), Tad Friend of The New Yorker remarked that when Dexter is struggling to connect with Rita or soliciting advice from his victims, "the show finds its voice."[18]On December 14, 2006, Michael C. Hall was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category Best Actor in a Television Drama Series for playing Dexter. He was also renominated and won the Golden Globe Award for his role as Dexter at the 2010 ceremony. The show was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series for its second season (Showtime's first ever drama to be nominated for the award), and its star for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. It won neither, losing to Mad Men and to Breaking Bad actor Bryan Cranston.[19] In 2008, it won a Scream Award For Best TV Show. In 2010, Hall won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series Drama and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. John Lithgow won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Performance by an Actor in a Television Series for his role in the series the same night.The third season finale on December 14, 2008 was watched by 1.51 million viewers, giving Showtime its highest ratings for any of its original series since 2004, when Nielsen started including original shows on premium channels in its ratings.[20] The fourth season finale aired on December 13, 2009 and was watched by 2.6 million viewers. It broke records for all of Showtime's original series and was their highest rated telecast in over a decade.[21] The fifth season finale was watched by a slightly smaller number of people (2.5 million). However, the fifth season as a whole was the highest rated season of Dexter, as it was watched, either on plain or on-demand TV, by more than 5 million people per week.[22] The show was declared the ninth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (20022012).[23]Dexter has been nominated for 19 Primetime Emmy Awards, in the category of Outstanding Drama Series 3 times in a row, from 2008 to 2010 and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (for Michael C. Hall) 4 times in a row, from 2008 to 2011. Dexter has also received over a dozen Creative Arts Emmy Awards. It has also been nominated for 7 Golden Globes (winning 2), 14 Satellite Awards (winning 7), 18 Saturn Awards (winning 5), 8 Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning 1), and 5 Writers Guild of America Awards.When U.S. network CBS announced in December 2007 it was considering Dexter for broadcast reruns over the public airwaves, the Parents Television Council (PTC) publicly protested the decision.[24][25] When the network began posting promotional videos of the rebroadcast on YouTube on January 29, 2008, PTC president Timothy F. Winter, in a formal press release, again called for CBS to not broadcast the show on broadcast television, saying that it "should remain on a premium subscription cable network" because "the series compels viewers to empathize with a serial killer, to root for him to prevail, to hope he doesn't get discovered.[26] " Winter went on to quote CBS President Leslie Moonves' post-Columbine comment: 'Anyone who thinks the media has nothing to do with [increasing violence in society] is an idiot.' Winter called on the public to demand local affiliates preempt Dexter, and warned advertisers the PTC would take action against any that sponsored the show.[27] Following Winter's press release, CBS added parental advisory notices to its broadcast promotions, and ultimately rated Dexter TV-14 for broadcast.[28] The show premiered on February 17, 2008, edited primarily for language and scenes containing sex or the dismemberment of live victims.[29] The PTC later objected to CBS broadcasting the final two episodes of the first season in a two-hour block starting as early as 8p.m. in some time zones.[30]In preparation for the UK launch of the series, FX experimented with an SMS-based viral marketing campaign. Created by digital advertising agency Ralph & Co, and promoted by online PR and social media agency Hot Cherry, unsuspecting mobile phone owners received the following unsolicited SMS messages addressed to them by name with no identifying information other than being from "Dexter": "Hello (name). I'm heading to the UK sooner than you might think. Dexter." The SMS-message would be followed by an email directing the user to an online video "news report" about a recent spree of killings. Using on-the-fly video manipulation, the user's name and a personalized message would be worked into the report the former written in blood on a wall near the crime scene, the latter added to a note in an evidence bag carried past the camera. While the marketing campaign succeeded in raising the profile of the show, it proved unpopular with many mobile owners who saw this as spam advertising aimed at mobile phones. In response to complaints about the SMS element of the campaign, FX issued the following statement:The text message you received was part of an internet viral campaign for our newest show Dexter. However it was not us who sent you the text but one of your friends. We do not have a database of viewer phone numbers. The text message went along with a piece on the net that you can then send on to other people you know. If you go to www.icetruck.tv you will see the page that one of your friends has filled in to send you that message. Therefore I suggest you have a word with anyone who knows your mobile number and see who sent you this message. For the record we did not make a record of any phone numbers used in this campaign.[31]Andrew Conley said the show inspired him to strangle his 10-year-old brother.[32] In an affidavit filed in Ohio County court, police said Andrew stated that he "watches a show called Dexter on Showtime, about a serial killer, and he stated, 'I feel just like him.'"[33]Norwegian hired killer who killed Faiza Ashraf on orders from Shamrez Khan. Nyflt claimed that he was inspired by Dexter and that he wanted to kill Khan, not Faiza, he wanted to kill Khan in front of Faiza in a way Dexter would, to "stop evil". He planned to burn the remains of Khan to hide the crime. His plot however failed when he strangled her in the trunk of his car.[34]"Prosecutors said Christopher Scott Wilson had a fascination with death when he killed Mackenzie Cowell in February 2010, comparing him to a serial-killing character from the television show 'Dexter' and describing his arm tattoo of Hannibal Lecter, another fictional character who was a serial killer. They ultimately charged Wilson, 31, with first-degree murder.The contrast of Wilson, who has no previous criminal record, with the popular girl who was a member of her school dance team known as the Apple-Ettes has drawn widespread media attention, and the spotlight is likely to continue to shine on Wenatchee when jury selection begins ...."[35]"Remember, Mackenzie's jugular vein had been cut. Browne argues there should have been blood discovered all over Chris Wilson's apartment. 'How do you explain that?' Van Sant asked Chief Wagg. 'He was interested and infatuated with the serial killer, Dexter--the series, 'Dexter, he replied. 'Dexter' is the hit Showtime series where the killer often brings his victim into a room draped in plastic to keep the crime scene clean. 'He very well could have had plastic down on the floor. We just don't know,' said Wagg." [36]Association was established between Twitchell, of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, during his first-degree murder trial, and the character of Dexter Morgan. After weeks of testimony and gruesome evidence presented in court, Twitchell was found guilty of the planned and deliberate murder of 38-year-old Johnny Altinger on April 12, 2011.[37] Twitchell, an aspiring filmmaker, had adopted the persona "Dexter Morgan" on Facebook and made a movie that was similar to how Dexter operates.[38] Prosecutors alleged that Twitchell had begun a secret double life inspired by Dexter.[39] Twitchell wanted to reenact the life of Dexter Morgan, and after writing a script for a Dexter movie, began posing as a woman online interested in having affairs with married men.[40] Detective Mark Anstey of the Edmonton Police Service was quoted as saying, "We have a lot of information to suggest he definitely idolizes Dexter," and Twitchell had posted a Facebook status stating that he believed he had "way too much in common with Dexter Morgan."[41][42]A video game based on Dexter developed by Icarus Studios and based on the events of season one, was released on September 13, 2009. It is available for the iPhone platform in the iTunes App Store. The game was released on the iPad on October 15, 2010, and on PC on February 15, 2011. The cast and crew of Dexter have been very supportive, with some of the cast providing full voice work for the game, including Michael C. Hall. The game has received many positive reviews, including an 8.0/10 from IGN. No additional content for the game has currently been released or announced as planned. Plans to release the game on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 seem to have been cancelled, as there has been no recent information regarding expansion of the game onto these platforms.Showtime launched Dexter Game On during Comic-Con in July 2010. It was a promotion that relied on community involvement. Part of the user's involvement required the user to use the scvngr application available for the iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad and Android platforms to complete treks around the five cities the game was available in. The final trek lead to a kill-room where the "Infinity Killer" had recently claimed a victim. A link was found in the room to a (fake) company called "Sleep Superbly", which began an extensive Showtime-maintained alternate reality game that continued until Dexter's fifth season premiere.[51]The alternate reality game involves players working cooperatively together to help catch the "Infinity Killer" and identify his victims. A number of other characters help. During the game, players communicate with the "Infinity Killer" among many others. There are also a few shady companies that have active roles. The game spans Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, etc. as well as countless unique sites created for the game. There are even phone numbers players can call. The characters and companies are controlled by real people, adding an extra realism and ability for intelligent conversation. In order to maintain a realistic feeling in the game, Showtime does not put their name or advertisements on most sites and pages created for the game.The music from the Dexter TV series was released on August 28, 2007 in the album Dexter: Music from the Showtime Original Series. It is produced by Showtime, and distributed by Milan Records. The album is also available online on the iTunes Store. The iTunes release includes five additional bonus tracks from Season 1 and 2.Gary Calamar, whose company, Go Music, also provides non-score music for True Blood, House and Men Of A Certain Age, music supervises Dexter (along with Music Coordinator Alyson Vidoli). The opening title theme was written by Rolfe Kent, and the score is composed by Daniel Licht and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese.EMCE Toys has planned the release of action figures based on the series.[52] Dark Horse Comics released a 7-inch bust of Dexter Morgan in March 2010, as part of its Last Toys on the Left series,[53] and released a Trinity Killer Bobble Head in April 2010.[54]A Dexter board game created by GDC-GameDevCo Ltd was released on September 30, 2010.[55]There is also a variety of items available from Showtime, including t-shirts, blood slide key rings and coasters, pens made to look like syringes of blood, an apron, mugs and glasses, posters, and even bin bags.[56]Dexter at TV.comCrime dramaSuspensePsychological thrillerBlack comedyMysteryMichael C.

The Chase centered around a family run veterinary practice.It was co-written by Gaynor Faye (credited as Gaynor Mellor), the daughter of the show's creator, Kay Mellor. Much filming for the series was carried out in and around Otley, West Yorkshire; the series is set in the fictional town of "Oxley".Episode 1 Chevin Chase veterinary practice is buzzing with excitement. The finishing touches are being made to the marquee in the garden with flowers arriving and tables being laid. Eight months pregnant Anna is directing the activity but begins to panic. Time is ticking away and her father George, the groom, is still operating on a puppy. Meanwhile in London, Sarah walks out on her cheating boyfriend David and drives up north. The church is packed to the rafters. Practice Manager Deborah is making disparaging remarks about everyone to her husband Rick, the practice Senior Partner. During a brief lull in her tirade, he slips outside for a sneaky cigarette with nurse Matt. Meanwhile fellow nurses Clare and Margaret enjoy a gossip about the guests and Sarah's imminent arrival. Sarah hasn't been home since her mum died two years ago and everyone wonders why... not least her sister Anna. Little does she know that Sarah hides a painful secret - she caught Anna's husband Tom in bed with one of the nurses, Fiona. And she hasn't been able to face any of them since. Just as Sarah enters the church, Fiona takes her seat. There's no time for trouble as the young bride Claudie, 30 years George's junior, makes her breath-taking entrance. At the wedding reception, chemistry ignites between Rick and Clare who share a brief kiss. Meanwhile, George makes a shocking announcement - he's retiring and moving to Malta with wife Claudie, leaving pregnant Anna and Sarah with a struggling business, one vet down, one vet defecting to the local opposition and a list of operations as long as their arm. George's revelation is enough to send Anna into labour. Anna and Tom race to the hospital, leaving Sarah in charge of the practice and their unruly kids. Anna gives birth to a girl who she names after her mother, Imogen. But George drops another shocking bombshell - they've re-mortgaged the house by 200,000. This leaves Sarah with no option but to muck in at the Chase. After a heated discussion, Fiona and Sarah make amends. Fiona reveals she has a son Theo from a previous failed relationship but little does Sarah know that the child is Tom's. Sarah's astonished when David turns up, begging her to come home, but she reveals she is home. Elsewhere, Tom's late on Theo's monthly payment. Fiona threatens to reveal all if he doesn't cough up soon...Episode 2 It's Sarah's first day in the practice and just the thought of it is giving her nightmares. During the morning household scrum she puts on her battle armour to face the big day - hair, make-up, suit - looking every inch the professional. But it's a costume hiding her big secret. Practice Manager Deborah isn't very welcoming and her encounter with Sarah leaves feathers severely ruffled. Sarah's first client of the day is a border collie which needs a mammary strip - a straightforward operation but tricky without an ultrasound. Fiona has the dog prepped, but when Sarah realises that the practice doesn't even have an ultrasound she freaks and walks out, heading back to David and London. Unknown to Sarah, her sly ex appears to be entertaining another woman. Anna is furious and bombards Sarah with some hard home truths and accuses her of constantly running away. Anna drops the shocking bombshell that their mother used to run away and cheated on their father, George. Furious and cornered, Sarah finally makes her big confession, "I'm not a vet any more. I gave it up two and a half years ago. I lost my confidence. I lost a dog... the blood kept on coming." Anna is shocked into silence. At the front desk, Deborah's dealing with the angry collie owner. It's Sarah's old flame, local farmer, Adrian Huby. He's delighted to see her again, but Sarah's intent on getting back to London. On the way home, she's haunted by her memories and decides to face her inner demons. Determined to confront the past head on, she returns to the practice to operate on Adrian's collie. It's touch and go for a while but after a tense two-hour operation, the dog pulls through. Eager to make the practice a success, Sarah sells her car to pay for the ultrasound equipment. She also calls David to tell him it's over once and for all. George and Claudie's return stuns Sarah and Anna. It transpires they've been stuck in Liverpool for two days as George's passport was out of date. George confides to Sarah that he's not ready to leave Oxley. Elsewhere, a feline client forces Rick and Clare to take a step closer. Meanwhile, Tom's secret is spiralling out of control as he struggles to meet Fiona's demands. In her stalker style, Fiona confides she wants Tom to be a proper father to Theo, and that their night of passion wasn't a mistake - she chose him.Episode 3 Still waiting for George's passport to arrive so they can go on honeymoon, Claudie is making her presence felt in the household. Both Anna and Sarah are struggling to keep their feelings towards their stepmother under control. When Claudie starts throwing their mum's belongings out, they are furious. And when George approaches Anna to suggest that she might invite Claudie to be Imogen's godmother, Anna refuses point blank. Sarah has arranged for an ultrasound demonstration and the team gather to see what this new technology can offer. They're all impressed and Sarah offers to pay for one there and then. George's unhappy about the rapid changes taking place in his practice until his daughter's remind him that, technically, he has retired. While everyone has been involved trying out the new equipment, Claudie has been babysitting with disastrous consequences, putting her on a collision course with Anna who is apoplectic with rage. The morning of Imogen's christening dawns with the usual family chaos. When Imogen is sick down her gown, George remembers that Anna's old gown is in a box amongst the things Claudie was clearing out. Dashing upstairs, Anna uncovers more than she bargained for when she opens the box and her birth certificate floats to the floor. She's stunned to discover George is not her father. When confronted, he declares he's always loved Anna like she's his own daughter. Anna demands to know who her real father is but he says that Imogen wouldn't reveal his identity. After a few drinks, Anna and George are reconciled. Fiona confesses to Anna that James isn't Theo's dad, and that she had an affair with a married man who Anna knows.

Series final on 9 September 2009.The Chase at bbc.co.ukThe Chase at the Internet Movie Database"Series 2, episode 8" shooting script at BBC Writers RoomDeadliest Catch is a documentary/reality television series produced by Original Productions for the Discovery Channel. It portrays the real life events aboard fishing vessels in the Bering Sea during the Alaskan king crab and C. opilio crab fishing seasons.The Aleutian Islands port of Dutch Harbor, Unalaska, Alaska, is the base of operations for the fishing fleet. The show's name derives from the inherent high risk of injury or death associated with the work.Deadliest Catch premiered on the Discovery Channel on April 12, 2005 and currently airs in over 150 countries. The first season consisted of ten episodes, with the finale airing on June 14, 2005. Subsequent seasons have aired on the same April to June or July schedule every year since the original 2005 season. On October 17th 2012, the 9th season of Deadliest Catch was announced and filming has officially begun. Season 9 is set to air in April 2013.The series follows life on "the vast Bering Sea" aboard five or more crab fishing boats (the four featured vesselsCornelia Marie, Wizard, Northwestern, and Time Banditand one or more "wild card" boats that are shown for all or part of a single season) during two of the dangerous crab fishing seasons, the October king crab season and the January opilio crab (a.k.a. C. opilio; often referred to as "snow crab" or "opies") season. The show emphasizes the real danger to the crew on the decks of these boats (and the Discovery Channel camera crews filming them) as crews ply their trade while ducking heavy crab pots swinging into position, maneuvering hundreds and thousands of pounds of crab across a deck strewn with tripping hazards (holding tank hatches, uneven surfaces, maintenance access plates), and leaning over the rails to position pots for either launch or retrieval as gale-force winds and waves four to five times taller than an average man constantly lash over the deck. The series also documents the dangers of even being on a boat in the Bering Sea crab grounds, in the midst of some of the coldest and stormiest waters on earth, where even the most minor problem becomes complex and requires considerable ingenuity to solve when the nearest port of any kind is often hundreds of miles away.Each episode focuses on a story, situation, or theme that occurs on one or more boats, while side stories delve into the backgrounds and particular activities of one or two crew members, in particular the "greenhorns" (rookie crew members) on several boats. The fleets' captains are featured prominently throughout the episodes, highlighting their camaraderie with their fellow captains and relationships with their crew, as well as their competitive nature against the other boats in the fleet regarding the hunt for crab throughout the fishing grounds. Common themes woven throughout the overarching storyline of the particular fishing season include friendly rivalries between the captains (particularly between Sig Hansen of the Northwestern, Johnathan Hillstrand of the Time Bandit, and Phil Harris of the Cornelia Marie), the familial ties throughout the fleet (brothers Sig, Norm, and Edgar Hansen, who own the Northwestern; Phil Harris and his two sons, Jake and Josh, on the Cornelia Marie; the Hillstrand familybrothers Jonathan, Andy, and Neil, and Jonathan's son Scotton the Time Bandit; brothers Keith and Monte Colburn of the Wizard), the stresses of life on the Bering Sea, and the high burnout rate among greenhorns.Because Alaskan crab fishing is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world, the U.S. Coast Guard rescue squads stationed at Integrated Support Command Kodiak (Kodiak, Alaska) and their outpost on St. Paul Island, near the northern end of the crab fishing grounds, are frequently shown doing their own dangerous work: rescuing crab boat crew members who fall victim to the harsh conditions on the Bering Sea. The USCG rescue squad was featured prominently during the episodes surrounding the loss of F/V Big Valley in January 2005, the loss of F/V Ocean Challenger in October 2006, and the loss of F/V Katmai in October 2008. Original Productions keeps a camera crew stationed with the Coast Guard during the filming of the show.The show has no on-camera host. Instead, narrators provide commentary and verbally connect the storylines as the show shifts from one crab boat to another. Discovery Channel voice artist Mike Rowe narrates the action for North American airings; UK voice artist Bill Petrie, reading from a slightly altered script, offers a regionally familiar accent for the English speaking viewers of the show in Europe. The show transitions between boats using a mock-up radar screen that shows the positions of the boats relative to one another and to the two ends of the fishing grounds, St. Paul Island to the north and Dutch Harbor to the south.Rowe was originally supposed to be the on-camera host as well and had appeared in taped footage as himself during the first season of shooting. As filming of the first season was nearing completion, Discovery greenlighted production on another Rowe project, Dirty Jobs, under the condition that Rowe choose only one show upon which to appear in person. As Rowe relates the story, Discovery told him that the two shows would be airing back-to-back on the same night, thus, "We can't have you telling us stories about six dead fishermen on camera and making a fart joke with your arm in a cow's ass."[1] Most of the footage Rowe shot during the first season became part of the first season's "Behind the Scenes" episode. Beginning after the third season of Deadliest Catch, Rowe took on hosting duties of a post-season behind-the-scenes miniseries entitled After the Catch, formatted as a roundtable discussion featuring the captains relating their experiences filming the preceding season's episodes. A season 3 episode of Dirty Jobs (2007-2008) saw Rowe return to Alaska to take part in a job tangentially related to the fishing industrydiesel fuel spill cleanup. Another episode that same season featured Rowe at work on board the F/V Legacy doing trawl fishing and at-sea shellfish and other seafood processing, during which Rowe made numerous references to the crab fishing of Deadliest Catch.Because Deadliest Catch is essentially a filmed record of everyday life in a stressful working environment, the producers have to resort to censoring gestures and language that would be deemed inappropriate for television audiences. For example, under the U.S. Television Ratings system, Deadliest Catch is rated TV-14 with inappropriate language ("L") as a highlighted concern.[2] For visual disguise of such items as finger gestures, bloody injuries, or non-featured crew member anonymity, the producers use the traditional pixelization or simple blurring. However, due to the sheer volume of profanities used in the course of everyday crew member conversation aboard the crab vessels featured in Deadliest Catch, the producers occasionally employ alternate methods of censoring said profanities, using sound effects such as a ship's horn, the "clang" of a hatch door, or a burst of radio static in place of the traditional "bleep".The Behind the Scenes special provided insight on how the program is produced. A two-person TV crew lives on each boat profiled. They use handheld Sony HVR-Z5U and HVR-Z7U HDV cameras to shoot most of the series (one on the main deck, one in the wheelhouse). Additional footage is provided by four stationary cameras that are permanently mounted around the ship and are constantly recording. Shots from vantage points outside the boat are accomplished through a variety of methods, including the use of a helicopter (for footage near the harbor) and a cameraman on a chase boat (in season 1, the main chase boat was the Time Bandit). The crew also makes use of underwater cameras, including one attached to a crab pot for a "crab's eye view" of the pot being retrieved in season 2, one mounted in the main crab tank on the Northwestern beginning in season 2, and one mounted to a submersible watercraft beginning in season 3.Because of a lack of space on the boats, the crews do not have an audio mixer. Audio is recorded using wireless microphones worn by the fishermen and shotgun microphones attached to the cameras.Although the equipment is carefully waterproofed, the cameras are routinely damaged by saltwater corrosion, ice, and accidents.Shooting episodes of Deadliest Catch is a dangerous occupation for the camera crews on board the boats. In the early seasons, when many of the camera crews had little to no experience on crab boats, they frequently ran into dangers not normally encountered when shooting a documentary. Northwestern captain Sig Hansen told talk show host Jimmy Kimmel that he saved a cameraman's life during the first season, screaming at him to get out of the way just seconds before a 900-pound crab pot swinging from a crane crossed the space where the cameraman had been standing and shooting.[3] In another incident, showcased on the behind the scenes special, an inattentive cameraman ended up having his leg fall through an open hatch on the deck of one of the boats when he unwittingly stepped into the hole, suffering three broken ribs (and, according to the cameraman himself, having to buy a case of beer for the entire crew as per tradition on crab boats).Interactions between the film crew and the fishermen appear in the show occasionally. During an episode of season 4, Wizard captain Keith Colburn was seen demanding that cameras be turned off when he got into a heated argument with his brother, Monte Colburn. The cameras were turned off, but the Colburns neglected to remove their wireless mics and the subsequent exchange was recorded and featured in the episode. Also in season 4, Cornelia Marie Captain Phil Harris asked the cameraman filming him not to tell anyone else about his injuries, for fear it would stall his fishing. Later on, crew member and later acting captain Murray Gamrath, concerned for Phil's well-being, was seen asking a cameraman to keep an eye on him and report any incident. During season 5, the camera crew on the Northwestern was requested not to film a crew member being informed of his sister's death; which the camera crew honored.On January 29, 2010, as Original Productions' crews shot footage for season 6 of the Cornelia Marie offloading C. opilio crab at St. Paul Island, Phil Harriswho had earlier complained of being excessively tiredwent to his stateroom to retrieve pain medicines and collapsed. 2nd year Engineer Steve Ward discovered Captain Phil on the floor of his stateroom, conscious but not able to move his left leg or his left hand. Ward immediately got Phil's sons Josh & Jake to come to Harris's stateroom while he called for paramedics. According to Thom Beers, producer and creator of Deadliest Catch, Harris insisted that the camera crews continue to film him. "We want to remember Phil as who he was," Beers told Zap2it.com writer Kate O'Hare. "We want to remember all the dynamics, but at the same time the guy was insistent when we were doing this, saying, 'Dude, you've got to. We've got to have an end to the story [about the strength and resiliency of familial bonds, especially the father/son bond]. You want to film this, film this.'"[4] Beers said he honored Harris' wishes and continued to shoot as Harris was airlifted to Anchorage, Alaska, where doctors performed emergency brain surgery to relieve the pressure building up in the cranial vault and avoid further brain damage. Harris spent eleven days in ICU before succumbing to complications from his stroke on February 9, 2010.[4]The Soul Rebels Brass Band performed a New Orleans style Jazz Funeral for the late Captain Phil Harris on After The Catch.[5]Some shots that would be difficult to capture with cameras are computer-generated imagery (CGI):Sig Hansen, captain of the Northwestern, serves as a technical advisor to the series' producers.On September 28, 2010, it was reported that three of the principal captains featured throughout the series' run, the brothers Andy and Johnathan Hillstrand and Sig Hansen, would not return to the show due to litigation initiated by Discovery Communications involving the Hillstrands.[6] On October 8, 2010, it was announced that the three captains had reached an agreement with Discovery and would return for the seventh season.[7]Commercial fishing has long been considered one of the most dangerous jobs in America. In 2006, the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranked commercial fishing as the job occupation with the highest fatality rate with 141.7 per 100,000, almost 75% higher than the fatality rate of pilots, flight engineers, and loggers, the next most hazardous occupations.[8] However, Alaskan king crab fishing is considered even more dangerous than the average commercial fishing job, due to the conditions of the Bering Sea during the seasons they fish for crab. According to the pilot episode, the death rate during the main crab seasons averages out to nearly one fisherman per week, while the injury rate for crews on most crab boats in the fleet is nearly 100% due to the severe weather conditions (frigid gales, rogue waves, ice formations on and around the boat) and the danger of working with such heavy machinery on a constantly rolling boat deck. Alaskan king crab fishing reported over 300 fatalities per 100,000 as of 2005,[9] with over 80% of those deaths caused by drowning or hypothermia.[10]The series' first season was shot during the final year of the derby style king crab fishery. The subsequent seasons have been set after the change to a quota system as part of a process known as "rationalization". Under the old derby style, a large number of crews competed with each other to catch crab during a restrictive time window. Under the new Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) system, established owners, such as those shown on the series, have been given quotas which they can fill at a more relaxed pace. In theory, it is intended to be safer, which was the main rationale for the change in the fishing rules. The transition to the quota system was also expected to increase the value of crab, by limiting the market of available crab. An influx of foreign crab negated some of these gains during the 2006 season.[11] The rationalization process put many crews out of work because the owners of many small boats found their assigned quotas too small to meet operating expenses. During the first season run under the IFQ system, the fleet shrank from over 250 boats to about 89 larger boats with high quotas.[12]The opening theme for the U.S. TV airings is "Wanted Dead or Alive" by Bon Jovi, although this song is not used on the official DVD releases nor in the European version of the show.Commercials for season 3 shown on the Discovery Channel family of networks featured an updated and faster version of the hit Styx song "Come Sail Away", performed by the punk rock cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Commercials for Season 7 featured the song "Ain't No Grave", by Johnny Cash.Incidental music used in the episodes themselves is provided by Amygdala Music, a music production group run by Leslie Beers, wife of Deadliest Catch creator/producer Thom Beers.In addition to incidental music, entire compositions written and performed by well-known recording artists are also added as "episode themes." An example would be the song "Always a Rebel," written, performed, and produced by folk-rock recording artist Vinnie James, at the request of the show's producer, Matt Renner, when the two met in Dutch Harbor during the filming of the 2008 season of Deadliest Catch. The song appeared as the theme track to "The Final Hour," which was the season finale for the 2008 season. Lines of the song were inspired by accounts of life on the Bering Sea by Josh Harris of the Cornelia Marie and series director of photography Zac McFarlane.[13]The song "Between" by singer/songwriter Vienna Teng was used on a few episodes during season 2.The final four minutes of the season 6 episode "Redemption Day" features Johnny Cash's rendition of Sheryl Crow's "Redemption Day"; the song plays over a montage of the crab vessels fighting through a massive Arctic squall and of Josh Harris sitting in a waiting room with friends as doctors struggle to revive Phil Harris, whose health has suddenly taken a turn for the worse. As Josh calls his brother Jake to deliver the news that "we lost Dad, dude", the song's final chorus"Freedom"repeats solemnly four times and fades out over a simple shot of the Bering Sea raging. The instrumental version of the song was used on Discovery Canada.The show is shot aboard various fishing vessels, some of which change between seasons.^1 During shooting of the first season of Deadliest Catch, the F/V Big Valley sank on January 15, 2005, sometime after 0734 Alaska Standard Time when the Coast Guard first detected her EPIRB signal. Five members of the six man crew perished; three were never found. Cache Seel was the only survivor. Discovery Channel camera crews on the Maverick and Cornelia Marie captured the first footage of the debris field, confirming that the boat had capsized and gone down. The search for the ship is featured in the episode "Dead of Winter".^2 Harris was forced to leave during the C. opilio season in season 4 due to what turned out to be a pulmonary embolism, and his medical issues prevented him from going out during the king crab portion of season 5. Murray Gamrath relieved him as captain in both seasons. A camera crew stayed with Harris both when he was hospitalized in season 4 and after his forced departure at the start of season 5. He continued to make occasional appearances during season 5. Harris suffered a massive stroke on January 29, 2010, during filming of the C. opilio season for season 6 and died on February 9, 2010, from complications. Derrick Ray took over as captain for the remainder of the season.[14][15]^3 Nyhammer, captain of the F/V Rollo, served as a senior deckhand on the North American during the King crab portion of season 4.^4 The F/V Time Bandit can be seen in the background of the behind the scenes episode serving as the main chase vessel during season 1, though she is never officially identified during the season itself.^5 The F/V Trailblazer was seen in the season 3 episodes "Man Overboard!" and "Cheating Death". She was also featured in the fifth season.^6 The F/V Vixen did have a film crew on the boat; none of the footage aired in the U.S. version, but did air in some of the international editions.^8 Instead of footage of USCGCAcushnet(WMEC-167) being shown, footage of USCGCAlex Haley(WMEC-39) was shown.As of the end of season 5 in 2009, a total of 69 episodes of Deadliest Catch have been shown, not counting the pilot series America's Deadliest Season, which had four episodes. The show draws consistently high ratings for Discovery Channel; season 3 attracted more than 49 million viewers over the course of the season and over 3 million viewers per first-run episode, making it one of 2007's most successful programs on cable TV.[26]Overall ratings for season 6 exceeded season 5's by more than 10%; as a result, Deadliest Catch regularly wins its U.S. prime time telecast timeslot (Tuesdays, 9:00-10:00p.m.EST).[27] Ratings for the season opener "Slow Burn" drew a record 4.6 million viewers;[27] on June 22, 2010, "Blown Off Course", the first of five episodes that dealt with Phil Harris' stroke and its impact, drew 5.2 million viewers, more than 10% over "Slow Burn".[28] On July 13, 2010, the episode "Redemption Day", which dealt with the death of Harris at its close, set another record audience for the show with 8.5 million viewers, making the episode the third-most-viewed broadcast in Discovery Channel's history.[29]Deadliest Catch was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards for the 2007 television season. The series itself was nominated for Outstanding Nonfiction Series; the third season episode "The Unforgiving Sea" received nominations for Outstanding Cinematography For Nonfiction Programming, Outstanding Picture Editing For Nonfiction Programming, and Outstanding Sound Mixing For Nonfiction Programming (Single or Multi-camera).[30] In 2012, the series won two of its three Emmy nominations for the eighth season episode "I Don't Wanna Die".[31]The show was created as a regular series after two well-received pilots about Alaskan crabbing were produced by Thom Beers for the Discovery Channel.The first pilot was a one-hour documentary entitled Deadliest Job in the World, which appeared in 1999. The show, which started with the sinking of the Rosie G (5 on board, all rescued alive), followed the Fierce Allegiance through the 1999 opilio crab season.The second pilot was a three-part miniseries entitled America's Deadliest Season, which premiered on July 18, 2004, and covered the 2003-04 king and opilio crab seasons. The miniseries followed the vessels Northwestern, Erla-N and Sea Star during king crab, and Erla-N, Saga and Arctic Dawn during opilio crab. The series also features several crises, including the half-capsized Raven (5 on board, all rescued alive), man-overboard calls from Shaman (recovered dead) and Saga (greenhorn Kevin Davis, rescued alive), and the constant threat of cold water and freezing spray.Beers did the voiceover narration for both series. Discovery picked up the show and ordered an 8-episode season to premiere in 2005. Beers turned the narration duties over to fellow Discovery Channel voice artist Mike Rowe, allowing Beers to continue working on new show development through his production company, Original Productions.After the Catch is a roundtable documentary-style television mini-series that follows the captains from Deadliest Catch when they're not fishing. The captains and crew members swap stories about the experiences and sights while fishing the Bering Sea. The spin-off series is produced in partnership with Original Productions and Silent Crow Arts. The first season aired in 2007, filmed at the Lockspot Cafe, a bar in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood, hosted by Deadliest Catch narrator Mike Rowe. After the Catch II aired in 2008, filmed at Pratty's Bar in Gloucester, Massachusetts and hosted by Rowe. The third season, titled After the Catch III, aired in 2009 and was filmed at RTs Longboard Bar and Grill in San Diego with Cash Cab's Ben Bailey hosting. After the Catch IV aired in 2010, and was filmed at the Blue Nile bar in New Orleans, with Rowe returning as host.The After the Catch miniseries was one of Discovery Channel's highest rated miniseries in 2007 and spawned several additional after-the-series type follow-up documentaries such as Everest: After the Climb, the 2007 follow-up to Everest: Beyond the Limit.In April 2008, Andy and Johnathan Hillstrand, co-captains of the Time Bandit, with Malcolm MacPherson, released a book titled Time Bandit: Two Brothers, the Bering Sea, and One of the World's Deadliest Jobs (ISBN 978-0345503725) on their experiences as crab fishermen.Also in April 2008, Discovery Channel released the book Deadliest Catch: Desperate Hours (ISBN 978-0696239427). Edited by Larry Erikson, the book contains true stories of life and death at sea, as related by the captains and deckhands featured on the series.In December 2009, Travis Arket, deckhand of the North American, released a book titled Deadliest Waters: Bering Sea Photography (ISBN 978-1935359210). This book is the first photography collection to be published about Bering Sea crab fishing, and includes many people from Deadliest Catch.In March 2010, Sig Hansen, captain of the Northwestern, released the book North by Northwestern: A Seafaring Family on Deadly Alaskan Waters (ISBN 978-0312591144), co-written with author Mark Sundeen. The book details the Hansen family's history and that of Norwegian Americans in the fishing industry of the Pacific Northwest.In February 2008, Sig Hansen and Liquid Dragon Studios announced the upcoming release of a video game for Xbox 360 and PC inspired by the Deadliest Catch series entitled Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm. Liquid Dragon designers spent time with the Hansens on the Northwestern in the safety of Dutch Harbor and out on the Bering Sea to give them a sense of the real conditions that needed to be duplicated in the game. The game itself features the Northwestern, Cornelia Marie, and Sea Star as crab boats that can be chosen by the player, along with the Bering Star and the Shellfish.[32] On June 17, 2008, the game was released in stores around North America.[33]A second game, titled Deadliest Catch: Sea of Chaos, was announced in June 2010 and released in November 2010. It is developed by DoubleTap Games and published by Crave Entertainment.[34]1 Format

Also, how a rope that had fallen into the female crab release hole could get wrapped around the propellor and pull the pot across the deck, possibly crushing a man.In season 5, CGI was used to illustrate the sinking Katmai deploying liferafts amidst battering waves.In season 5, episode 8, CGI was used to show how a tarp would protect the Wizard's pots from freezing.In season 6, episode 6, CGI was used to illustrate the grounding of a vessel in False Pass.In season 6, episode 15, CGI was used to illustrate the (failing) hydraulic system on the Kodiak.In season 7, episode 11, CGI was used to illustrate an anchor cable snapping during deployment on the Time Bandit.Flying Wild AlaskaGold Rush (TV series)Great Lake WarriorsIce PilotsIce Road TruckersLobster WarsLobstermen: Jeopardy at SeaSwords: Life On the LineWhale WarsWicked TunaDeadliest Catch Network at Discovery.comDeadliest Catch at the Internet Movie DatabaseThe Walking Dead is an American television drama series developed by Frank Darabont. It is based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. The series stars Andrew Lincoln as sheriff's deputy[2] Rick Grimes, who awakens from a coma to find the world dominated by flesh-eating "walkers", resembling the zombies of George A. Romero's horror movies. He sets out to find his family and encounters many other survivors along the way.The Walking Dead premiered on October 31, 2010 on the cable television channel AMC in the United States.[3] Based on its reception, AMC renewed the series for a second season of 13 episodes, which premiered on October 16, 2011.[4][5] Two episodes into the second season, AMC announced that the show would return for a third season, airing on October 14, 2012.[6]The series has been well received[7][8] and has received many award nominations, including a Writers Guild of America Award nomination and a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Television Series Drama.[9][10] The series has also attained strong Nielsen ratings, beating various records for a cable series, including receiving 10.9 million viewers for its season three premiere to become the most-watched basic cable drama telecast in history.[11]Based on the comic book series of the same name, The Walking Dead tells the story of a small group of survivors living in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse.[12] Most of the story takes place in the Atlanta metropolitan area and then the surrounding countryside of northern Georgia, as the survivors search for a safe haven away from the shuffling hordes of predatory "walkers" (as the zombies are referred to in the show), who devour any living thing they catch, and whose bite is infectious to humans. The plot is focused primarily on the dilemmas the group faces as they struggle to balance their humanity with their survival against the zombie horde, and later, how they cope with members' being killed and deal with other human survivors they encounter, many of whom are dangerous and predatory themselves.The group is led by Rick Grimes, who was a sheriff's deputy[2] before the zombie outbreak. At every turn they are faced with the horror of the walking zombies, the changing dynamic of their group, and hostility from the scattered remains of a struggling human populace who are focused on their own survival now that the structures of society have collapsed.The series begins with sheriff's deputy[2] Rick Grimes' waking up from a coma in an abandoned and badly damaged hospital. Leaving the hospital Rick discovers a post-apocalyptic world overrun with zombies (or "walkers," as they are often referred to in-show). Rick also discovers his wife and son are missing. Acting on a rumor from a fellow survivor, he arms himself and begins a perilous journey to Atlanta, Georgia, where the CDC is said to have set up a quarantined safe-zone in the city. Upon reaching Atlanta, he soon discovers that the city is instead overrun by the walkers.A few miles outside the city, Rick's wife Lori and son Carl have been hiding from the walkers with Shane Walsh, Rick's partner and best friend. They have established a camp with a small group of fellow survivors. After being rescued from Atlanta by members of the group and reunited with Lori and Carl, Rick assumes command with Shane. A band of walkers eventually attack the camp, leaving several survivors dead and the remainder to seek aid from the CDC.In the CDC, all but one staff member, Dr. Edwin Jenner, have either fled or killed themselves. Dr. Jenner explains that his research into the infection has not yielded a cure, and that he has not been in contact with anyone for a long while. Lack of fuel for the emergency generators soon initiates the building's safety protocols, which will trigger an explosion designed to destroy the facility and prevent the escape of deadly diseases. Jenner and Jacqui, a member of Rick's group, decide to stay and end their struggle. Dr. Jenner whispers something into Rick's ear, and the group escapes just as the CDC is incinerated in the explosion.The second season begins with Rick and his group of survivors escaping the CDC. They decide that Fort Benning will be their next destination. Along the way, they encounter a traffic jam of abandoned vehicles on Interstate 85. The group loots several vehicles, but are forced to hide under them as a large herd of walkers approaches. A walker chases Sophia out from her hiding spot and, with another walker, pursues her into the woods. Rick finds her but loses her again after drawing off the walkers. The remaining group deals with interpersonal relationships while various searches for Sophia are performed. Carl is accidentally shot by a hunter named Otis during the initial search. To get help for Carl, Otis leads Rick and Shane to a large, isolated farm owned by a veterinarian named Hershel Greene, then helps Shane look for medical supplies; after getting them, Shane hurts his leg and sacrifices Otis to the walkers so he can get away. The survivors then move to the farm while Carl recovers. Rick's group tries to co-exist alongside Hershel's family, but dangerous secrets and disagreements over leadership cause tensions to rise. Lori is revealed to be pregnant (the father is unknown), and Glenn builds a romantic relationship with Maggie, one of Hershel's daughters. Glenn also discovers that the barn is full of walkers, some of whom are Hershel's family members. After Shane releases the walkers to be exterminated, Sophia appears as one of them and Rick shoots her.Hershel disappears to grieve for his family and is found by Rick and Glenn drinking at a local tavern, where they meet two other survivors. The situation rapidly turns sour and Rick kills the two men in a gunfight. The dead men's group quickly finds and opens fire on Rick, Hershel, and Glenn at the bar. The noise attracts a large herd of walkers, and one of the attackers, Randall, is injured and left behind. Rick and the others take him back to the farm, where they realize that Randall is likely to reveal the farm's location to his former group. As Rick's group deliberates on what to do with him, Dale is fatally wounded by a walker, forcing Daryl to euthanize Dale. The group later conducts a search for Randall, whom Shane had secretly released and murdered in the woods. Daryl and Glenn find him  as a walker  and kill him. Daryl concludes that a broken neck was the cause of Randall's reanimation, as opposed to a walker's bite or scratch. Meanwhile, Shane and Rick confront each other  the former having planned the fake search so that he could murder Rick. Rick gets the upper hand and stabs Shane in the torso, killing him. Carl arrives just in time to see Shane revive as a walker, and shoots him down.The gunshot attracts a large herd of other walkers, who quickly overrun the property; in the ensuing battle and escape, Jimmy and Patricia are devoured, and Andrea is left behind. Andrea survives on her own, and is later rescued by a hooded woman accompanied by chained, armless walkers. The remaining survivors regroup but are forced to make camp due to lack of gasoline. After hearing of Randall's fate, Rick finally reveals what Jenner whispered to him at the end of Season One: that every survivor is infected with the walker virus. As Rick's leadership is questioned by the group later that night, a large prison looms in a pan out of the final scene.The third season begins several months after the group escaped the farm, with Lori far into her pregnancy. Rick and the group come upon a deserted prison, hoping to convert it into their new home. While searching the prison for supplies, Hershel is bitten by a walker and Rick is forced to amputate his leg. They soon meet a new group of survivors, who are prison inmates; in exchange for food, they clear out a different cell block for where the inmates can reside away from Rick's group. A walker breakout then forces the group to split up; T-Dog is bitten in the struggle and sacrifices his life to save Carol. Lori goes into labor, and insists that Maggie perform an emergency Caesarean section to save the baby; the operation kills Lori, and Carl is forced to shoot her to prevent reanimation. After grieving over their losses, the baby is eventually named Judith.Meanwhile, Michonne and Andrea are taken to the town of Woodbury, a safe haven from the walkers. They meet the Governor, the town's leader, and learn that Merle Dixon - Daryl's older brother - has taken refuge there as well. Michonne is immediately suspicious of the Governor and the settlement and decides to leave, but Andrea refuses to go with her. Merle is ordered to hunt down Michonne  wounding her, and then capturing Maggie and Glenn while they are out scavenging. Michonne eventually arrives at the prison, then guides Rick, Daryl, and Oscar back to Woodbury on a rescue mission.The series features several actors whom Walking Dead developer Frank Darabont has worked with previously, including Laurie Holden, Jeffrey DeMunn, Melissa McBride, Sam Witwer and Juan Gabriel Pareja. All five appeared in his 2007 film The Mist, along with Thomas Jane, who originally was set to star in the series when it was pitched to HBO. He was later in talks with Darabont to possibly guest star on the series as of fall 2010,[13] but with Darabont's departure,[14] it is unknown whether the guest spot will happen or not. Laurie Holden also appeared in the 2001 film The Majestic (as Adele Stanton, Jim Carrey's character's love interest), which Darabont directed. DeMunn has also appeared in several of Darabont's films; in addition to The Mist and The Majestic, he appeared in The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999). Samuel Witwer (Private Jessup in Darabont's The Mist) appeared near the end of the pilot episode as a dead soldier in the tank where Rick hides. It was planned that Witwer would reprise his role in the original conception of the season two premiere.[15]On January 20, 2010 AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series adapted from The Walking Dead comic book series, with Frank Darabont and Gale Anne Hurd acting as executive producers and Darabont writing and directing.[16] The entire series was pre-ordered based just on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement.[17] In January 2010 a review of the pilot episode's script attracted further attention.[18] The pilot began filming in Atlanta, Georgia on May 15, 2010[19] after AMC had officially ordered a six episode first season.[20] The series' remaining episodes began filming on June 2, 2010 with Darabont serving as showrunner.[21][22] On August 31, 2010, Darabont reported that The Walking Dead had been picked up for a second season, with production to begin in February 2011. On November 8, 2010, AMC confirmed that there would be a second season consisting of 13 episodes.[4] He would also like to include some of the "environmental elements" that take place during Volume 2 of Kirkman's book.[23]On October 25, 2011, AMC announced that it ordered a third season of The Walking Dead, saying, "Season two continues to deliver the strongest telecasts for any drama in basic cable history."[6]The first season writing staff consisted of series developer and executive producer Frank Darabont, who wrote/co-wrote four of the six episodes; executive producer Charles H. Eglee; executive producer and creator of the comic book, Robert Kirkman; co-executive producer Jack LoGiudice; consulting producer Adam Fierro; and Glen Mazzara; who all contributed to one episode each. Along with Darabont, who directed the pilot episode, the remaining five were directed by Michelle MacLaren, Gwyneth Horder-Payton, Johan Renck, Ernest Dickerson, and Guy Ferland.[24]On December 1, 2010, Deadline.com reported that Darabont had fired his writing staff, including executive producer Charles "Chic" Eglee, and planned to use freelance writers for the second season.[25] Kirkman called the announcement "premature" and clarified that Eglee left to pursue other projects when Darabont decided to stay on as showrunner and that no definitive plans had been made regarding the writing staff for season two.[26]On December 3, 2010, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, executive producer Gale Anne Hurd commented that "It's completely inaccurate. [In] the writers' room, there are people that have set up other projects that will be their first priority if their own series is picked up as a pilot or if it's a series. I think [Eglee] just decided that he wants to run his own show." She revealed that it would be likely for the show to return in October 2011, as Darabont and Kirkman planned on mapping out the next season early in 2011. She also confirmed that "every one of the principal cast is signed up for multiple seasons."[27] In July 2011, series developer and showrunner Frank Darabont stepped down from his position as showrunner for the series.[28] It was believed that he was unable to adjust to the schedule of running a television series.[28] However, The Hollywood Reporter reported he had been fired over disputes over planned budget cuts and executive meddling.[29] Executive producer Glen Mazzara was then appointed the new showrunner.[30] New writers joined the writing staff in the second season, including co-executive producer Evan Reilly, producer Scott M. Gimple, and story editor Angela Kang.Bear McCreary was hired to compose the score for the series. McCreary stated that the main theme was based on his viewing of production designs for the opening title sequence. Instead of doing a full theme song as with his earlier works, McCreary chose to use a simple, repeating motif from the strings section.[31]The Walking Dead is mostly filmed in Georgia.[32] The series is completely shot on 16 mm film.[33] David Tattersall was the director of photography for the pilot episode with David Boyd as the director of photography on the remainder of the episodes. Production design is done by Greg Melton and Alex Hajdu. The effects team includes veteran special effects makeup designer Gregory Nicotero, special effects coordinator Darrell Pritchett, and visual effects supervisors Sam Nicholson and Jason Sperling.[34]The Walking Dead debuted during the same week in 120 countries. As part of an expansive campaign to advertise and heighten anticipation for the premiere, AMC and FOX International Channels coordinated a worldwide zombie invasion event on October 26, 2010. The stunt involved invading 26 major cities, starting with Taipei and Hong Kong, and ending in Los Angeles for the U.S. premiere, within a 24 hour period.[35]The show's official website released, just prior to the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, a motion comic based on Issue No. 1 of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr.[36] The site also posted a making-of documentary primarily about the first episode, as well as a number of other behind-the-scenes videos and interviews. In the documentary, comic series creator and show executive producer Robert Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard say they are pleased with how faithful the show is to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic's original character drawings.[37]Action figures of characters from the series, including Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon and a zombie Walker and Biter, were created for release in November 2011. The figures, which are manufactured by McFarlane Toys, are designed to resemble the actors on the series. Figures created to resemble the characters as drawn in the comic book were released in September 2011.[38]Following the encore presentation of the second season premiere on October 16, 2011, a live after-show titled Talking Dead premiered, featuring host Chris Hardwick discussing the latest episode with fans, actors, and producers of the show.[39]Scenes from the pilot were screened July 23, 2010 as part of the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International.[40] It premiered on AMC on October 31, 2010.[3] It premiered internationally on Fox International Channels during the first week of November.[41] The first season premiered in Hong Kong on TVB Pearl on August 30, 2011.[42] Almost two weeks before the official premiere on AMC, the pilot episode leaked online.[43] International broadcast rights for the show were sold and announced on June 14, 2010.[44]The season 1 DVD and Blu-ray was released on March 8, 2011.[45] A three-disc special edition of the first seasonfeaturing new featurettes and audio commentarieswas released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 4, 2011.[46] The European versions of the first season DVD and Blu-ray are edited for gore, with cuts to episode two ("Guts"),[47] episode three ("Tell It to the Frogs"),[48] episode four ("Vatos")[49] and episode five ("Wildfire").[50]The first season was reviewed positively by critics, receiving a score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic (based on 25 reviews), indicating "universal acclaim".[7] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com included the show on their list of 9 new TV shows not to miss, giving it a grade of "A", with the author saying, "A film-quality drama series about zombies? Somebody pinch me!"[51]The second season received generally positive reviews with a score of 80 out of 100 based on 22 reviews on Metacritic.[8] Some critics have been less than enthused with the second season, such as Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, who now describes the series as "a nighttime soap with occasional appearances by deceased but moving, flesh-rotting, flesh-eating cameo monsters. [...] Every week, it seemed, a passel of folks went out and rooted around for awhile, came back to camp, and everyone lives off the fat of Hershel's land until it was time to go out and search for Sophia again. Occasionally someone reminded Rick they're supposed to be headed for Fort Benning and he gets all huffy about not leaving any child behind. It became a parody of a Samuel Beckett play."[52] Nate Rawlings of Time's online entertainment section noted that "the pace during the first half of this season has been brutally slow. Changes in pace would be fine if the writers had used that time well, which they have not. They've tried to develop individual characters, but each subplot meant to add a layer to a character has been quickly resolved."[53] Other critics such as Scott Wampler of Collider.com recognised the mediocre first half of the season claiming that "there seemed to be a helluva lot of water-treading." However Wampler also distinguished the increased quality of the second half saying "The second-half of the season, on the other hand, seemed far more intense, more interesting, better written."[54]The third season is currently being reviewed positively by critics, receiving a score of 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 18 reviews.[55] Verne Gay of Newsday claims that season 3 "doesn't disappoint" going on to say that there are "spots where you will yell out at the screen, 'Oh, my God, that just didn't happen.' Yes, the new season is that good", concluding his review by giving the season an A+ rating.[56]The Walking Dead was nominated for Best New Series for the 2011 Writers Guild of America Awards.[10] It was nominated for Best Television Series Drama at the 68th Golden Globe Awards.[9] It was also named during the American Film Institute Awards 2010 as one of the top 10 television programs of 2010.[64] For the 2011 Saturn Awards, the series received six nominationsfor Best Television Presentation, Andrew Lincoln for Best Actor in Television, Sarah Wayne Callies for Best Actress on Television, Steven Yeun for Best Supporting Actor in Television, Laurie Holden for Best Supporting Actress in Television, and Noah Emmerich for Best Guest Starring Role in Television.[65] The series was nominated for Best Drama Series at the inaugural 1st Critics' Choice Television Awards.[66] The pilot episode "Days Gone Bye" received three nominations for the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awardsit was nominated for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series[67] and won for Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie or a Special.[68]The Walking Dead at TV.com1 Series overview

The premiere was number two in the hour for total viewers, which generated 2.47 million unique viewers, and was ABC Family's best delivery in the timeslot since the premiere of The Secret Life of the American Teenager.The second episode retained 100% of its premiere audience with 2.48 million viewers, despite the usual downward trend following a premiere of a show, and built on its premiere audience. It was the dominant number one of its time slot in Adults 1849, and the number one show in female teens.[33] Subsequent episodes fluctuated between 2.09 and 2.74 million viewers.[34][35] The August 10, 2010 "Summer Finale" episode drew 3.07 million viewers.On June 28, 2010, ABC Family ordered 12 more episodes of the show, bringing its total first-season order to 22.[2] On January 10, 2011, ABC Family picked the show up for a second season that premiered on June 14, 2011. During the summer of 2011, Pretty Little Liars was basic cable's top scripted series in women aged 1834 and viewers 1234.[36][37] The second half of season 2 will air on Mondays at 8/7c, beginning on January 2, 2012.[38]On November 29, 2011, ABC Family renewed the show for a third season, which will consist of 24 episodes.[5][39][40] On 4 October 2012, ABC Family announced that the show was renewed for a fourth season, which would comprise of 24 episodes. The second half of the third season is due to air on January 8th, 2013. [41]Pretty Little Liars opened with initially mixed critical reviews. Metacritic gave the pilot episode 52 out of 100, based upon 14 critical reviews.[42] The New York Daily News gave the show its highest score, with 80/100, commenting that it "makes most popular vampire romances look anemic", while concluding, "Pretty Little Liars could go in several directions, including mundane teen clichs. It's got an equally good shot at making us care about these imperfect pretty girls."[43] The New York Post gave the show three out of five stars, stating, "OK, so we've established that there is no socially redeeming value in this series and that your kids shouldn't watch it if they are too young and impressionable. But if you can distract them enough to miss the first 15 minutes, the show isn't half-bad. Actually, it is half-good, if that makes sense."[44] The Los Angeles Times wrote that the series is "one of those shows that manages to mildly, and perhaps unintentionally, spoof its genre while fully participating in it, and that's not a bad thing at all."[45]Entertainment Weekly had a less favorable review, giving the show its lowest score of 16 out of 100, saying, "Imagine the pitch for Liars: It's I Know What You Did Last Summer meets Gossip Girl, but like not so subtle. The new ABC Family drama, based on the popular young-adult book series about a high school clique whose missing leader continuously causes problems and she ends up dead comes back to haunt them via locker-room notes, IMs, and text messages, hits every racy teentertainment mark so hard (everyone's hair is so fullof secrets!) that it feels like the only thing missing is a visit from the ghosts of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze, Jr."[46] The Hollywood Reporter compared the show to those on The CW and noted, "Sure, there's a lot here that sustains more eye-rolling than interested stares, but a little patience might be warranted."[47]Pretty Little Liars at TV.com1 Series synopsis2 Cast3 Production

The main cast also includes Lyndsy Fonseca, Shane West, Aaron Stanford, Melinda Clarke and Xander Berkeley.The series centers on a secret government-funded organization known as Division. Recruiting young people with troubled backgrounds, Division erases all evidence of their past lives and molds them into efficient spies and assassins. Having broken away from the government, Division now performs operations for their own gain, hurting their country if need be. However, Nikita, a Division agent, has gone rogue after her civilian fianc is killed by Division. She makes it her mission to bring down Division.On the outside, she trains a woman named Alex, who then becomes a recruit inside Division, working as a mole for her mentor.[3] Having trained Nikita, Michael, a Division operative, is ordered by his boss and Division's leader, Percy, to deal with his former student. In the meantime, Division continues training its recruits and performing operations unaware of Nikita's mole.[3] Over the course of Season one, Nikita goes up against Division, as well as Gogola Russian security department and established enemy of Divisionon many occasions. She is consistently supported by Alex's intelligence from inside and she slowly brings other allies to her side including Michael when he realizes the true extent of Percy's corruption as well as his own feelings for Nikita. At the end of Season one, Nikita and Michael set off on their own without Alex; having turned on Nikita after learning of her role in her father's death, Alex is exposed and left at the mercy of Division and Oversightthe government group that controls Division.In season two, Nikita and Michael press their efforts against Oversight, seeking to destroy the group, which will also cripple Division at the same time. In the ever-changing landscape of events it is seen that, despite many turns and personal discoveries, their feelings for each other remain both deep and constant. Nikita gradually brings her old allies and teammates back together to actively fight Division which is now under Amanda's control. She was placed in charge after Percy was locked away for his actions in season one.The series borrows many characters, or at least their names, from the 1997 television series La Femme Nikita. Maggie Q portrays Nikita, the protagonist and a former spy and assassin who has gone rogue and now plans to bring down Division. Q also performs her own stunts.[4] Shane West plays Michael, a Division operative who trained Nikita. He sees Division and its recruits as a kind of family to him, the complete opposite of Amanda, portrayed by Melinda Clarke, Division's psychologist, interrogator, and a master manipulator. Seymour Birkhoff, Division's computer genius and head technician, is portrayed by Aaron Stanford. The head of Division is Percy, played by Xander Berkeley.In the season one finale, the audience is introduced to a Senator Madeline Pierce, played by Alberta Watson, who also played the part of Madeline in the former La Femme Nikita series (Madeline was that series' counterpart to Amanda). Lyndsy Fonseca portrays Alexandra "Alex" Udinov, a former sex slave and drug addict who was arrested after a robbery and later became Division's newest recruit. She is also a mole that Nikita is using to destroy Division from the inside. Other recruits include Jaden (Tiffany Hines) and Thom (Ashton Holmes) but their characters are later killed off by Nathan (Thad Luckinbill) and Alex respectively. Dillon Casey portrays the role of Sean Pierce, a former Navy Seal sent to Division directly from Oversight. Noah Bean portrays Ryan Fletcher, an agent in the CIA.At the beginning of season one, two people break into a drug store and attempt to rob it. While stealing the drugs and trying to make a get-away, the owner challenges one of the robbers. When this robber hesitates in shooting the owner of the store, their partner doubles back to shoot him before quickly running off, leaving the remaining individual to be arrested when the police show up. Once the police arrive, they pull off the individual's mask and discover that the robber is a young female who is revealed to be Alex. As she is being brought into prison, she fights the prison guards with good strength; she does not know that Michael, a Division operative, is watching. He later processses her into Division, a covert unit of the government that has gone rogue. Division recruits young and susceptible criminals into their training program and forces them to carry out their missions under penalty of death. The higher-up members of Division are worried because Nikita has come back online, meaning that she is targeting Division from the outside. What is worse is that she has a mole inside; however at this point in the show no one in Division is aware of it. By the end of the first episode, it is revealed that this mole is in fact Alex. Halfway through the season it is revealed that the second robber in the drug store was Nikita and that the robbery was set-up specifically to attract Division's attention so that they would recruit Alex. The two communicate through a chat program Nikita created while still at Division called the shellbox program.As the series progresses, Nikita routinely sabotages missions that would have been major successes for Division and also saves the lives of recruits such as Sarah. More light is shed on the lives of the main characters through flashbacks, and it is revealed that Alex was sold into sex trafficking by a man who had been close to her oligarch father before his murder at the hands of Division.Eventually, Michael joins Nikita's cause after she helps him find Kasim Tariq. He tells her a story of how he had once found the perfect home for his now-deceased wife and daughter. Tariq took that away from him when he killed both of them.Alex is forced to kill her rival, Jaden, after Nathan (Alex's neighbor and love interest) accidentally reveals in front of her that Alex has told him of her true occupation as an assassin. Back at Division Amanda tells Alex that Division now operates with new cochlear implants that are virtually undetectable by even the wearers, and Jaden's implant recorded Alex calling Nikita shortly after she killed Jaden. It is at this time that Alex is found out as the mole inside Division and is thus interrogated. Michael is locked away in Division as well.Michael escapes courtesy of Birkhoff (Division's head technician) and joins Nikita who had just escaped from the CIA headquarters. As the season ends, it is shown that Amanda has disabled Alex's killchip, and wants to recruit her into Oversight (Division's leadership and funding stream). Michael and Nikita try not to worry about the future as they drive off into the oncoming storm.At the end of season one, Nikita and Alex's relationship had been shattered, while Nikita and Michael's relationship was restored. Now, Nikita and Michael are on the run with a hard drive called "the black box" containing the Division's darkest secrets and conspiracies. Together, they plan to right the wrongs that Division has committed over the years, one mission at a time. But leading the hunt for the black box this time is Alex who knows all of Nikita's tricks. Although Alex is working with Division, she isn't looking to kill Nikita, only to get the black box, with Nikita in her way.Division is now officially under government control and under the leadership of Ryan Fletcher, tasked with hunting down rogue agents, nicknamed the "Dirty Thirty", who refused the recall order, as well discover the mysterious group Percy was seeking to join."It's a dark fairytale. This girl [Nikita] is taken from one life, her identity is erased, she's put in another life and she's transformed. It's like Alice in Wonderland. She's told, 'Eat this, drink that, steal this, kill that,' and she's not told why. And, she begins to find her own identity through that. It's just a great story."The CW had long been interested in an action-adventure series centered on a strong female character.[4] On January 27, 2010, The CW ordered a pilot episode of Nikita.[19] The 2010 television series is more closely tied to Luc Besson's 1990 French film Nikita than the 1997 television series, La Femme Nikita.[20] However, the series does borrow many characters, or at least character names, from the previous television series.During the 2010 Television Critics Association press tour in Los Angeles on July 29, 2010, executive producer Craig Silverstein said he was approached by Warner Bros. who owned the rights.[21] Silverstein said, "My first thought was I love Nikita. My second thought was, 'it's been done.' Could it be done fresh? Could we have a take where you didn't know where this story would end?"[21] As a result, two major changes have been made, one of which is the decision to have the story take place after Nikita has escaped. Maggie Q stated, "No one's told her story after the fact. No one knows where she is going."[22] In addition, a new character, Alex, is introduced who has an unexpected backstory.[23] The series is a mix of a weekly mission/counter-mission, and a story arc running through the first season that explores Nikita's relationships with Alex and Michael.[23]While presenting its 201011 season schedule on May 21, 2010, The CW officially confirmed the pick-up of the series and announced its intention to air Nikita after The Vampire Diaries on Thursday nights.[24][25] In October 2010, Entertainment Weekly announced that the series would receive some tweaking to attract more of a female audience, including a new character and potential love interest for Nikita. However, the network promised the core of the show would remain the same.[26] Later that month, the show was picked up for a full season, which would total 22 episodes.[27][28] The CW have admitted they took gambles this year but said they were "thrilled that [it] paid off for us."[29]On May 17, 2011 Nikita was renewed for a second season by The CW in the 201112 fall season.[30] It was later announced that they would move the show to Friday nights at 8:00pm, pairing it with Supernatural, beginning Fall 2011.[31][32] The second season premiered on Friday, September 23, 2011.[33]On May 11, 2012, The CW renewed the series for a full third season.[16]In February 2010, Maggie Q was cast as Nikita.[34] Executive producer Silverstein said casting Q was a simple and quick process, because they wanted someone who was beautiful, and could fight, and who you could believe holding a gun at the same time, and she was perfect.[18] Later that month, Shane West was cast as Michael.[35] In March, Lyndsy Fonseca was given the role of Alex.[36] Silvertein commented the casting of Fonseca, saying she came in at the last moment but was cast because they liked her intensity.[18] Later that month, Tiffany Hines was cast as Jaden[37] and Xander Berkeley was added to the cast as Percy.[38] In October 2010, Noah Bean gained a recurring role as Ryan Fletcher, a CIA case officer and analyst.[39]Casting for second season started on July 2011 when Dillon Casey was cast as Sean Pierce, an former U.S. Navy Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU, formerly Seal Team Six) officer contracted to monitor Amanda's work at Division and recover the stolen black boxes.[40] Casey was later promoted as a series regular.[41]After being recurring cast members for two seasons, Noah Bean and Devon Sawa were made series regulars for the third season.[42][43]Although the show is set in and around New Jersey, Nikita is primarily filmed in Canada--specifically, in Toronto and elsewhere in Ontario. Much of the show is filmed on location, but studio shooting is also used for sets such as 'Division' and the penthouse. Many landmark locations used on the show, such as the White House, are actually doubles meant to represent various places in North America.[44]The general reception of Nikita has been positive, with a large fanbase forming early in the first season. Metacritic reports that the average review score for the pilot episode was 66 out of 100, a reception which it ranks as "Generally favourable".[45] Comparisons were made to Joss Whedon's Dollhouse. Critics had praise for Maggie Q in the lead role, the look of the show, solid action sequences, and an intriguing twist at the end, but noted that the dialogue needed some humor.The pilot episode drew 3.57million viewers on its initial broadcast.[46] The CW broadcast an encore of the pilot the following day, which drew approximately 2.6million viewers.[47] The finale was seen by 1.94million viewers.[48] The first season averaged 2.40million viewers and a 0.9 1849 rating in live + same day DVR viewing per episode.[49]The following is a table for the seasonal rankings, based on average total estimated viewers per episode, of Nikita on The CW. "Rank" refers to how Nikita rated compared to the other television series which aired during prime time hours.In the UK, the show has been the most watched show for Sky Living every week that its autumn episodes aired.[55] When it returned from hiatus in the summer in a new Wednesday 9:00PM slot, it finished fourth in the week.

They are introduced to the show to change their pernicious behavior and accomplish specific goals. The cast, deemed "bad girls", enjoy a luxurious lifestyle in a fine mansion for three months, during which they must obey specified rules. Their lives inside and outside of the house are chronicled and recorded by the production team.The format of the show has changed from early seasons. If a "bad girl" breaks a rule, she is evicted from the show and, if it is early in the season, replaced by a new "bad girl". There have been nine complete seasons of The Bad Girls Club, with the ninth season currently airing.[3] The fourth season had the highest ratings in the show's history, lead episode "Go with the Flo" starring Florina Flo Kaja, becoming its "breakthrough season".[4]The Bad Girls Club is broadcast in five countries (United States, Netherlands, Australia, Hungary, and Sweden). It has received negative reviews from critics, who believe the show promotes violence by adolescent viewers. Furthermore, several cast members made controversial remarks which outraged many viewers. There have been three spin-offs of The Bad Girls Club. One of them, Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too, where past cast members seek true love, has gained high ratings. Oxygen has also released a mobile game, comic strip and merchandise to promote the show.Of the 61 contestants, Kerry Harvick (of season one) was a successful country singer before the show.[5] Tanisha Thomas (of season two) later hosted Oxygen's OxygenLive! and the subsequent seasons of Love Games: Bad Girls Need Love Too. Thomas, who is dubbed as being the "godmother" to all contestants,[6] has her own television documentary entitled Tanisha Gets Married. As of Season 8 she's been the host of the reunion specials.The show follows seven rebellious women[7] aged from 21 to 29,[8] who live together in a mansion for three months, while cameramen record their behavior in and out of the house. The girls, deemed "bad girls", come from different backgrounds and have personality, psychological, and behavioral problems.[8][9][10] They try to cope with one another and change their promiscuous behavior to become role models for young women. Some cast members try to accomplish specific goals.[8][11][12]Throughout the show, the "bad girls" must adapt to the frequent mood and behavior changes of their housemates.[13][14] They must also obey rules that were presented to them prior to their arrival. If they engage in violence towards other girls or break other rules, they may be evicted under the show's zero tolerance policy. The girls must undergo interviews in the diary room and take part in confessionals.[13] They are allowed to contact their families and friends using a computer connected to a large-screen television, but the use of televisions or cell phones is prohibited in the house.The girls often form cliques, create havoc, book parties in night clubs, and shop for groceries, while attempting to maintain their personal lives.[14] Bullying and "tag teaming" (where multiple cast members intimidate another cast member) are seen throughout the series. Girls have occasionally left the show because of trouble with roommates, isolation, problems at home, court proceedings, or their own narcissism.[14][15] On rare occasions, multiple "bad girls" may wish to leave the show; this has happened only in seasons one (2006), five (2010), and six (2011), eight (2012) and nine (2012).[14] If a girl departs early in the season, a "replacement bad girl" is introduced within one or two episodes. In most cases the replacement is treated badly, and in the fifth season one left voluntarily.[14]The Bad Girls Club creed, introduced in season three, is:[14]A Bad Girl knows what she wants and how to get it. She makes her own way, makes her own rules and she makes no apologies. A Bad Girl blazes her own trail and removes obstacles from her path. A Bad Girl fights and forces her way to the top with style and beauty. A Bad Girl believes in jumping first and looking later. People will love you. People will hate you. Others will secretly wish to be you. A Bad Girl is you.[16]The format for the first season of Bad Girls Club was different from that of subsequent seasons.[17] The age range for season one was from 21 to 31. The use of nicknames was not introduced until the third season. Season one was the first in which multiple "replacement bad girls" entered the show.[17]Although there were differences in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one was the way the show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of who is going to be the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.[17]In the second season, the format of the show changed drastically.[17] The maximum age dropped from 31 to 27. The cast of season two were given mandatory non-profit jobs to help them build a work ethic and to experience the stabilizing effect of being interdependent with others, for example in teamwork and commitment, to equip them for success in later life.[18] Quitting the job or failure to attend resulted in mandatory removal from the show. The girls were given the jobs of planning, decision making, and building cooperation. Season two was the first and only season of the Bad Girls Club to do this, and was also the last to air 30-minute episodes.[18]On August 3, 2010, during the OxygenLive TV recap episode, the show combined Facebook and Twitter with a live broadcast. Fans submitted opinions and comments about the show and its cast, which were aired during the 10pm hour.[19]In January 2011, Oxygen released OxygenLive!, an online talk show hosted by Tanisha Thomas, one of the "bad girls" of season two. It was broadcast after season six debuted on Oxygen, and focused on the cast of season six, occasionally bringing in "bad girls" from earlier seasons. Thomas asked the girls several questions to prompt rumors and confessions.[20]Many homophobic slurs have caught the attention of media outlets.[58][59][60] Mary Mitchell of Sun Times stated that the show was "hazardous to the female psyche"[61] and wrote, "Just like some teens try to emulate rappers in their dress and behavior, the same is true for 'bad girls.'"[61] She also commented that the show gives a "distorted picture" of how to live the good life,[61] calling the cast "wannabes" who are "sleeping in a mansion they can't pay for".[61] Mitchell believes that most people know the cast are living "a bogus lifestyle", and assesses the message of the Bad Girls Club as "disturbing".[61]Many adolescents have emulated The Bad Girls Club[62] The show has also received negative criticism from African-American viewers, believing that it is "not what being a black woman is all about."[63] Mary Chase Breedlove of Reflector objected that "there are several TV programs devoted to acting as trashy and mean as possible ('Bad Girls' Club,'...)".[64] The New York Daily News suggested that Bad Girls Club was the equivalent of professional wrestling.[65] Kris De Leon of BuddyTV described the show as "crude, rude and pointless, but sort of addictive to some people."[21]Brian Lowry of Variety thought that the producers made the "wrong decision" when they created the show.[14] He believed that the cast of Bad Girls Club auditioned for the show for their "15 minutes of fame".[10] He said that Bad Girls Club "arrived a little late in this game, on a channel lacking the kind of exposure or public footprint to qualify the show even as the stuff guilty pleasures are made of". Lowry believed that the show "loses" and that Oxygen attracts viewers who generally get drunk at bars and make a scene. He also suggested that "maybe it's time to "BAG" these bad-attitude girls and beat a hasty retreat back to the real world".[10]Anita Gates of The New York Times referred to Bad Girls Club as "a great argument for bringing back programming with actors". She believed that the "average emotional age" appeared to be 15, in contrast to the girls' real ages. She stated that the "unpleasant villains cancel one another out and actually make badness uninteresting", commenting that their behavior might not be "bad enough". Gates concluded by suggesting that Bad Girls Club is the on-location equivalent of The Jerry Springer Show.[66] Kelly West of Cinemablend stated that Bad Girls Club is "so much fun to watch".[67]During "Off The Wall", the first episode of the fourth season, Natalie Nunn told Annie Andersen that Chris Brown was at a night club that she wanted to attend, and asked Anderson if she was a fan. Anderson said not, because of the domestic violence case that Brown was involved in. Nunn defended Brown, saying "Who cares, Rihanna was a punk bitch, and she got her ass beat for a reason".[68] Nunn called Rihanna a "crazy bitch" and claimed to know her, unlike Anderson. After the episode aired, Brown reportedly stated that he did not know who Nunn was. Nunn questioned this during the reunion show,[69][70] claiming that Brown had said it because the cast of the show had not yet been revealed. Perez Hilton, the host of the reunion, asked Nunn if Rihanna had confronted her about her comments. Nunn answered yes, stating that the two had argued during a dinner party in New York City.[71] During the reunion, Nunn claimed to have had a "fling" with Brown before the show.[72][73] Shortly before the end of the reunion, Nunn said that she did not condone domestic violence and apologized if her comment had enraged fans and people who had been victims of it.[73]"I had no idea where I was and [I] had to go to the ER over night. They later discovered someone put PCP in my drink. They can't show it on the show because then that guy could sue for slander. I am honestly really upset they didnt explain that [during] the show. I think its really messed up how the entire story [wasn't ever] shown [on air], whatever. DONE!"[74]During the episode "The Wicked Witch Of Key West", a stranger at a bar offered to buy drinks for Kristen Guinane and Christina Marie Hopkins. He spiked the drinks with PCP hallucinogenic pills, and Guinane became intoxicated. She claimed to have suffered bruises on her body when the man grabbed her and handled her roughly. Guinane reported that the producers of the show did not want to identify the man on television for fear of a lawsuit. She blamed the drug for her hitting another cast-member, Lea Beaulieu, in the face, leading to a fight.[74]While Hopkins was intoxicated, one of her friends recorded her making racial slurs about an African American woman who had threatened her. The video surfaced on the Internet and outraged many people.[75] Oxygen told TMZ.com that Hopkins would never appear on their channel again.[75] TMZ.com reported that roommate Ashley Cheatham had sent Hopkins a hate text visible to the world, telling her to "do us all a favor and go kill yourself".[76] After the incident Hopkins released a letter of apology, giving her reasons for the slurs.[77]After season five had wrapped, Catya Washington was sentenced to jail for possession of a concealed weapon and illegal use of drugs.[15][78][79][80] Several days later, she was due back in court after she struck and sprayed mace in the face of the wife of a man she was dating.[81] She was charged with aggravated assault, inflicting serious bodily injury, possession of an instrument of crime (mace), and recklessly endangering another person.[81] Washington's bail was set at $500,000, but her family raised this,[82] and she was released under house arrest.[83] Several days later, however, she was arrested again for "outstanding bench warrant".[84] However, she was released from jail with an extended curfew.[85]During season six production, residents of Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, complained that noise levels and swearing were unbearable and inappropriate for them and their children to listen to during the night.[86] The residents called local law enforcement agencies four or five times to deal with the late-night disturbances.[86] Clarissa Keller, a Sherman Oaks resident, complained that she had a six-year-old son and didn't want him to listen to the swearing. She set up a petition calling for a ban on all production companies in the Sherman Oaks hills.[86] Location managers and production crew declined to discuss the neighbors' complaints.[86]The Bad Girls Club permit required the entire production to abide by a "minimum outdoor activity and noise" rule, but local residents claimed that the show did not keep noise levels down.[86] The house for season six was rented for $20,000 a month. The owner said that he would not allow this type of production to rent his home in the future.[86]On March 13, 2011, TMZ.com reported that the cast was banned from at least eight clubs that "[didn't] want to be associated with the show's bad image", and that they were excluded from Pierre Thomas's Mardi Gras party at the The Metropolitan Night Club.[87]On April 12, 2011, cast member Tasha Malek complained to an on-duty police officer outside the Bad Girls house about the conduct of fellow cast member Nastasia Townsend. She claimed that Townsend had placed her personal belongings into a garbage bag, telling her "she needed to leave the house", and that the incident had escalated into a fight.[88] The two were issued summonses by the police for disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct.[89]Malek released a statement saying "I don't think its right to be gay", offending some LGBT fans of the show.[58][59][60]Judi Jai was arrested on November 9, 2011 on suspicion of DUI. While police searched her car for a sobriety test Jackson climbed out of the squad car and attempted to escape on foot where police found her in a nearby home where later charges of resisting arrest and theft[90]On March 24, 2012 TMZ reported that cast member Gia Sapp-Hernandez was arrested on assault charges for an altercation with several men in a Myrtle Beach, SC nightclub in which reportedly she bit one of them during an event promoting the show. Sapp-Hernandez then released a statement to TMZ saying that she had been partying with the male accuser earlier that night when he "hinted" that he wanted to have sex with her. When she turned him down he became irate and belligerent and punched her in the face twice and that was when police arrived to the scene, Gia claims the officers "ignored" her accusations instead choosing to believe the man.[91]During auditions at the Dick's Last Resort in Dallas, TX a fight escalated between several women, leading producers to cancel auditions there.

It is based on the DC Comics character Superman, originally created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The television series was initially broadcast by The WB Television Network (The WB), premiering on October 16, 2001. After Smallville's fifth season, The WB and UPN merged to form The CW Television Network, which became the broadcaster for the show in the United States. It ended its tenth and final season on May 13, 2011. The series follows the adventures of Clark Kent (Tom Welling), who resides in the fictional town of Smallville, Kansas, during the years before he becomes Superman. The first four seasons focus on Clark and his friends' high school years. After season five, the show ventured into more adult settings, eventually focusing on his career at the Daily Planet, as well as introducing other DC comic book superheroes and villains.The concept for Smallville was created after a potential series chronicling a young Bruce Wayne's journey toward becoming Batman failed to generate interest. After meeting with the president of Warner Bros. Television, series developers Gough and Millar pitched their "no tights, no flights" rule, which would break Superman down to the bare essentials and look at the events leading up to Clark Kent becoming Superman. After seven seasons with the show, Gough and Millar departed without providing a specific reason. Smallville was predominantly filmed in and around Vancouver, British Columbia, with some of the local businesses and buildings substituting for Smallville locations. The music for the first six seasons was primarily composed by Mark Snow, who incorporated elements of John Williams's musical score from the original Superman film series. In season seven, Louis Febre, who had worked with Snow from the beginning, took over as primary composer.The series was generally positively received when it began broadcasting. Former Superman star Christopher Reeve voiced his approval of the series and even made two guest appearances. The pilot episode broke the record for highest-rated debut for The WB, with 8.4million viewers. Over ten seasons, it averaged approximately 4.34million viewers per episode, with season two averaging the highest ratings, at 6.3million. By the end of its run, Smallville had surpassed Stargate SG-1 to become the longest-running North American science fiction series, as well as the longest running comic book-based series in television history.[2][3] The series has earned distinctions ranging from Emmy Awards to Teen Choice Awards since its first season. The show has spawned a series of young-adult novels, a DC Comics bi-monthly comic book and soundtrack releases, as well as Smallville-related merchandise. All ten seasons of Smallville are available on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4. In April 2012, the series was continued in comic book form, with the storyline picking up shortly after the end of the series finale.The regular cast is introduced in season one. Storylines regularly included a villain deriving a power from kryptonite exposure. The one-episode villains were a plot device developed by Gough and Millar.[4] The first season primarily dealt with Clark trying to come to terms with his alien origins, and the revelation that his arrival on Earth was connected to the deaths of Lana Lang's parents.[5] After the first season, the series used fewer villain-of-the-week episodes, focusing more on story arcs which affected each character and explored Clark's origins.[6] Main story arcs include Clark's discovery of his Kryptonian heritage.[7] The disembodied voice of Clark's biological father, Jor-El, is introduced. He communicates to Clark via his spaceship, setting the stage for plots involving the fulfillment of Clark's earthly destiny.[8] In another arc which comprises the fourth season, Clark seeks three Kryptonian stones, at the instruction of Jor-El, which contain the knowledge of the universe and form his Fortress of Solitude.[9][10] Clark also battles Brainiac in his attempts to release the Kryptonian criminal General Zod.[11] Clark must either capture or destroy other escaped Phantom Zone criminals.[12] Clark's biological cousin Kara arrives,[13] and Lex Luthor finally discovers Clark's secret.[14] The eighth season features storylines involving the introduction of Davis Bloome, who is Smallville's interpretation of Doomsday, and a woman named Tess Mercer replaces Lex Luthor, who exits the series. Justin Hartley joins as a series regular in the role of Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, having been a recurring guest in season six.[15] With the ninth season, Major Zod (Callum Blue), along with other members of Zod's military group, are revived by Tess Mercer, though without their Kryptonian powers.[16] Their efforts to obtain those powers become the central conflict for the season's story arc. The tenth and final season revolves around Clark's attempts to get rid of his doubts and fears in order to become the hero he is meant to be, while also confronting his biggest challengesthe coming of Darkseid and the return of Lex Luthor.[17]Originally, Tollin/Robbins Productions wanted to do a series about a young Bruce Wayne. The feature film division of Warner Bros. had decided to develop an origin movie for Batman, and because they did not want to compete with a television series, the series idea was nixed.[5] In 2000 Tollin/Robbins approached Peter Roth, the President of Warner Bros. Television, about developing a series based on a young Superman. That same year, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar developed a pilot based on the film Eraser. After watching the pilot, Roth approached the two men about developing a second pilot based on the young Superman concept.[5] After meeting with Roth, Gough and Millar decided they did not want to do a series where there was lots of flying or a cape.[5] It was here Gough and Millar developed their "no tights, no flights" rule, vowing Clark would not, at any point, fly nor don the Superman suit during the run of the show.[62]Gough and Millar wanted to strip Superman down to his "bare essence", and explore the reasons that Clark Kent became Superman.[5] They felt that because they were not comic book fans or familiar with the universe, they would have an unbiased approach to the series. However, this did not keep them from learning about the characters; they both did research on the comics and picked and rearranged what they liked.[5] They returned and pitched their idea to both The WB and Fox on the same day.[63] A bidding war ensued between Fox and The WB, and the latter won out, with a commitment for thirteen episodes to start.[63]Roth, Gough, and Millar knew the show was going to be action-oriented, but they wanted to be able to reach the "middle America iconography" 7th Heaven had reached. To help create this atmosphere, the team decided the meteor shower bringing Clark to Earth would be the foundation for the franchise of the show. Not only does it act as the primary source behind the creation of the super-powered beings Clark must fight, but it acts as a sense of irony in his life. The meteor shower would give him a life on Earth, but it would also take away the parents of the girl he loves, and start Lex Luthor down a dark path, thanks to the loss of his hair during the shower. Roth loved the conflict that was created for Clark, in forcing him to deal with the fact his arrival caused so much pain.[5]Another problem the creators had to grapple with was the question of why Lex Luthor would be socializing with teenagers. To address this, they decided to create a sense of loneliness in the character, which they felt would require him to reach out to the teens.[5] The loneliness was echoed in Clark and Lana as well.[4] Gough and Millar wanted to provide a parallel to the Kents, so they created Lionel Luthor, Lex's father, which they saw as the "experiment in extreme parenting."[5] They wanted a younger Kent couple, because they felt they needed to be able to be involved in Clark's life and help him through his journey.[4] Chloe Sullivan, another character created just for the show, was meant to be the "outsider" the show needed. Gough and Millar felt the character was necessary so that someone would notice the strange happenings in Smallville.[5] She was not meant to act as a "precursor to Lois Lane".[4]The concept of Smallville has been described by Warner Bros. as a reinterpretation of the Superman mythology from its roots. Since the November 2004 reacquisition of Superboy by the Siegel family, there has arisen contention regarding a possible copyright infringement. The dispute is over ownership of the fictional town of Smallville, title setting of the show, and a claimed similarity between Superboy's title character and Smallville's Clark Kent. The heirs of Jerry Siegel claim "Smallville is part of the Superboy copyright," of which the Siegels own the rights.[64]On April 3, 2008, after seven seasons with the show, Gough and Millar announced they would be leaving Smallville. The developers, after thanking the cast and crew for all their hard work, acknowledged they never stopped fighting for what they saw as "their vision" of the show. A specific reason for their departure was not given.[65] Gough and Millar were replaced as showrunners by Todd Slavkin, Darren Swimmer, Kelly Souders, and Brian Peterson. All four had joined the crew at the start of the second season as writers and worked their way up to executive producers by the seventh season. On February 6, 2009, after one season, the L.A. Times confirmed executive producers Swimmer and Slavkin would not be returning for the ninth season of Smallville; instead, the pair would take over The CW's new series Melrose Place. The Times also reported Souders and Peterson would continue on as showrunners when Smallville starts its ninth season.[66] On July 24, 2009, it was announced Tom Welling had become a co-executive producer of the series.[67] On March 26, 2010, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Millar and Gough, alongside co-producer Tollin/Robins Production, had filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. and The CW. The lawsuit contests that Hollywood's "vertical integration" cost the pair millions of dollars. The suit claims that Warner Bros. failed to "maximize profits" while marketing Smallville, misrepresented production costs, and sold the show in foreign markets at "well below the value of the series". At this time, the lawsuit does not specify how much the plaintiffs are looking for in compensation.[68] In a press release by The CW on May 20, 2010, Tom Welling was named a full executive producer for the tenth and final season of the series.[69]The show was produced at BB Studios in Burnaby, British Columbia. Initially, production was going to be in Australia, but Vancouver had more of a "Middle America landscape". The city provided a site for the Kent farm, as well as doubling for Metropolis. It also provided a cheaper shooting location, and was in the same time zone as Los Angeles.[5] Smallville's "Main street" is a combination of two locations. Portions were shot in the town of Merritt, and the rest was shot in Cloverdale.[4] Cloverdale is particularly proud of being a filming site for the show. At its entrance is a sign which reads "Home of Smallville."Vancouver Technical School doubled as the exterior for Smallville High, as the film makers believed Van Tech had the "mid-American largess" they wanted.[4] This was in keeping with Millar's idea that Smallville should be the epitome of "Smalltown, USA".[22] The interiors of Templeton Secondary School were used for Smallville High's interior.[70] Over the course of season one, the production team repainted most of Templeton in Smallville Highs red and yellow colors, and stuck large Smallville High Crows logos everywhere. The team painted over so much of the school that the school eventually adopted red and yellow as their official school colors. The students became so accustomed to the filming crew, which had to shoot during the school semester, that when class was released the filmmakers would stand aside and the students would casually move the filming equipment aside to get to their lockers, and then venture to their next class without paying the crew much attention.[71]The Kent farm is a real farm located in Aldergrove. Owned by The Anderlinis, the production crew had to paint their home yellow for the show.[63] Exterior shots of Luthor Mansion were filmed at Hatley Castle in Victoria.[4] The interior shots were done at Shannon Mews, in Vancouver, which was also the set for the Dark Angel pilot and Along Came a Spider.[4] Movie house Clova Cinema, in Cloverdale, is used for exterior shots of The Talon, the show's coffee house.[72]The show is told from Clark's point of view, so the color scheme and camera selection is an illustration of Clark's interpretation of his environment. When he is safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment are "warm and gentle", with an earth tone; the camera movement is also "very gentle". When Clark is keeping his secret and he is not in danger, the lighting is more neutral and the camera moves around more. When there is danger the lighting becomes colder, and the camera shifts to a handheld to allow for more "extreme angles". With Metropolis, the crew attempts to instill the image of a "clean, hard-lined architecture", with blues, purples, and reflective metallics used as the dominant color scheme. The same concept is used for the characters. Lex is usually given a "glass, steel background", while Lionel receives a white or "clinical blue" background. Lex typically wears a lot of black, grey, and "cool tones" like purples and blues. Clark is represented by red, yellow, and blue, like the traditional Superman costume. He is also represented by the colors of the "All American": red, white, and blue.[73]Composer Mark Snow worked in tandem with producer Ken Horton to create the underscore for the show. Snow created his music on the spot, as he watched the picture, and then tweaked his performance upon reviewing the recordings from his initial play. He then sent the music to the producers, who decided if they liked it or not; if not, then they sent it back and he recomposed. Individual episodes also feature their own soundtrack, comprising one or more songs by musical bands. Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed of Daisy Music worked on finding these songs for the show's soundtrack. Pyken and Wade-Reed's choices were then discussed by the producers, who decided which songs they wanted and secured the licensing rights to the songs. Although Snow admits it initially seemed odd to combine the two musical sounds on a "typical action-adventure" television show, he admits "the producers seem to like the contrast of the modern songs and the traditional, orchestral approach to the score".[74]"I get a locked picture on a videotape which syncs up with all my gear in the studio. I write the music, finish it up, mix it up, send it through the airwaves on the internet, and the music editor puts it in. They call up usually and say, 'Thank you, well done.' Sometimes they call and say, 'Thank you, not so well donecan you change this or that?' I say 'Sure,' make the changes and send it back."[74]The main theme to Smallville is not composed by Snow, though he has composed opening themes, such as the one for The X-Files. The opening theme is the single "Save Me" by Remy Zero. Snow composed the closing credits, which was composed to represent the theme of the show. In the first two seasons, the music playing during the closing credits was one of the potential theme songs for the series, before Remy Zeros "Save Me" was selected. The melody was more "heroic" and "in-your-face". Mark Snow was told during season two the closing credits needed new music, as the show had evolved, and the existing music was no longer suitable. Snow created a new, toned-down score that featured a more "melodic" tune.[71] Snow has also reworked music from the previous Superman films. John Williams' musical score for the Krypton sequence in the opening credits of Superman was used in season two's "Rosetta"which featured a guest appearance by Christopher Reeveas well as various times in the season two finale. To save money, Snow recorded his own version of Williams' score, as using the original version would have required the team to pay Williams' orchestra as well.[75]In a May 23, 2008, interview with Randall Larson, Snow revealed he would not be returning, citing the workload of Smallville and Ghost Whisperer as being too much for him. Snow did state he would be returning for Ghost Whisperer. While reminiscing about his work on the show, Snow indicated much of the music had not really changed throughout the series, agreeing with Larson's description it was "more [about] maintaining the heroic concept and the mythology than progressing through specific changes".[76] Louis Febre, who worked closely with Snow from the beginning, became the sole composer for Smallville beginning with season seven. Febre commented that since he began composing for Smallville there was a shift to "thematic development" of the score, which would parallel the growth of the characters. Febre stated, "As Clark grew emotionally and intellectually more complex, I found a need to comment musically on his growth, and as he drew closer to his Superman persona, it became obvious that a 'Superman' theme would be required."[77]At various times the creative team had the chance to try different musical tones to enhance the storyline of an episode. Jennifer Pyken and Madonna Wade-Reed chose and coordinated the commercial music used on the show, for use when Snow's and Febre's scores were not used.[78] In season three's "Slumber", producer Ken Horton wondered if they could get a single band to provide all the music for the entire episode. During a breakfast meeting with the music department at Warner Bros., the topic of the band R.E.M. came up, and Pyken and Wade-Reed immediately saw an opportunity to connect the episodes featured band with an episodes story, which happened to revolve around REM sleep.[79] During the same season, Al Gough wanted to use Johnny Cashs cover of the Nine Inch Nails song "Hurt" for the final scene of "Shattered", where Lionel Luthor stares at Lex through a one-way mirror at Belle Reve sanitarium, from the moment he first read the script for the episode. Cash died while Wade-Reed was trying to get the song cleared for use. Believing the use of the song for the show would honor his memory, Cashs heirs cleared the rights for Smallville.[80]For season three's "Resurrection" and "Memoria", songs were particularly chosen to provide symbolism for the characters. In "Resurrection", The Rapture's "Infatuation" was used during a scene involving Lex and Lana. The point of the song was to symbolize the question, "Are we ever going to figure out what these two people think of each other?"[81] For "Memoria", Gough came up with the idea of using Evanescence's "My Immortal" for the final scene of the episode. Gough informed Wade-Reed as soon as he began working on the script what song he wanted to use for the closing scene, as he saw the song as being symbolically about mothers, and in that scene Clark is telling Martha his first memory as a child was of his biological mother, Lara.[82]Season three's "Velocity" provided the music editors with the opportunity to use hip-hop, a style of music rarely used on the show. The episode was similar to The Fast and the Furious, and primarily focused on the only black character on the show, Pete. Wade-Reed used a more hip-hop sound, which worked well with the story. Wade-Reed had heard of a British hip-hop artist named Dizzee Rascal, and became the first person in the United States to secure the licensing rights to use Rascals album.[83] Greg Beeman is known for directing episodes, and sometimes specific scenes, with particular songs in mind. For "Vortex" in season two, he used Coldplay's "In My Place" for the final scene.[84] In the season two finale, "Exodus", Beeman directed the scene where Lana shows up at the Kent barn, just before Lex' wedding, to Matthew Goods "Weapon". The lyrics speak of an angel and the Devil "by my side", and Beeman timed specific shots with specific moments in the lyrics.[75]Smallville first premiered at 9:00pm on Tuesday,[85] October 16, 2001 on The WB.[86] For the next five seasons the series was featured on The WB, and was moved from Tuesday nights at 9:00pm to Wednesday nights at 8:00pm, and eventually was changed to Thursday nights at 8:00pm. In 2006, before the start of Smallville's sixth season, it was announced The WB and UPN would be merging into a single entity, The CW. Shortly after that, The CW announced Smallville would continue to be part of the television lineup.[87] On May 21, 2009, it was announced Smallville would be returning to the 20092010 fall line-up for its ninth season, airing on Friday nights at 8:00pm.[88][89] On March 4, 2010, the CW announced Smallville had been renewed for a tenth season.[90] Smallville also aired in Canada, and during its seventh season the series aired one day earlier than in the United States.[91] Additionally, the series aired in the United Kingdom and New Zealand.[92][93] By the end of its tenth season, Smallville became the longest-running science fiction television show in the United States, breaking the record held by Stargate SG-1.[94] On August 10, 2011, it was announced that TNT will begin airing the series in syndication on October 3, 2011.[95]Smallville broke the record for highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4million viewers tuning in for its pilot.[96] The premiere also broke The WB record for adults age 1834, and finished first with viewers age 1234, leading Warner Bros. President of Entertainment Jordan Levin to credit the series with invigorating the network's Tuesday night lineup. The series was featured on the cover of Entertainment Weekly as one of five new shows to watch.[97] After its first season, Smallville placed sixth on the Parents Television Council's list of the "best shows for families".[98] The WB's CEO Jordan Levin recognized early concerns that the show had become a villain of the week series, and announced season two would introduce "smaller mini-arcs over three to four episodes", to move away from the series becoming a "serialized show".[99] Gough realized that although each succeeding season relied more on seasonal story arcs, there were occasions where they had to do villain of the week stories. It was clear the villain of the week stories were generally more criticized by fans of the Superman mythology. However, Gough wanted to be able to please both Superman fans and The WB's general audience, which consisted of teenagers who prefer the villain of the week stories over the episodes focusing more heavily on the Superman mythology.[100]Christopher Reeve, star of the Superman films, voiced his approval of the show:"I was a little bit skeptical when I heard about [Smallville] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to filmit's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom is doing a good job following the tradition."[101]MTV's Karl Heitmueller believed that Smallville's Clark Kent was a better representation of the original material, staying "true to the heart of the story" by showing Clark's selflessness and his struggle between his desires and obligations. At the same time, Heitmueller felt the show would have a difficult time addressing why no one in Smallville recognized Clark when he puts on the suit, especially Lex Luthor.[102] TV Guide's Michael Schneider classified it as one of the best examples of a superhero being adapted for television.[103] However, Christopher Hooton of Metro suggested Smallville was not a story that needed to be told, saying, "No-one bothered to follow Bruce Waynes tedious years spent manufacturing microchips before he became Batman, so why must we endure a decade of flannel shirt-wearing Clark Kent bucking hay?"[104]The following is a table for the seasonal rankings, based on average total estimated viewers per episode, of Smallville on The WB and The CW. "Rank" refers to how Smallville rated compared to the other television series which aired during primetime hours.Throughout its ten seasons, Smallville won numerous awards, ranging from Emmys to Teen Choice Awards. In 2002, the show won an Emmy for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series.[136] Four years later, the series was awarded an Emmy for Outstanding Editing for a Series for its fifth season episode "Arrival".[137][138] In 2008 Smallville again won the Outstanding Sound Editing Emmy for season seven's "Bizarro".[139]Smallville has been awarded Leo Awards on multiple occasions. Make-up artist Natalie Cosco was awarded the Leo Award for Best Make-Up twice, once for her work in the fourth season episode "Scare",[140] and again for her work in the sixth season episodes "Hydro" and "Wither".[141] In the 2006, Leo Awards, Barry Donlevy took home Best Cinematography in a Dramatic Series for his work on the fourth season episode "Spirit", while David Wilson won Best Production Design in a Dramatic Series for "Sacred".[142] Smallville's sixth season won a Leo Award for Best Dramatic Series. James Marshall won Best Direction for "Zod", Caronline Cranstoun won Best Costume Design for her work on "Arrow", and James Philpott won Best Production Design for "Justice".[141] In 2008, Smallville won the Leo Awards for Best Dramatic Series and Best Cinematography.[143] The visual effects team was recognized for their work on the pilot with an award for Best Visual Effects in 2002.[144] They were later recognized by the Visual Effects Society with a 2004 VES Award for Outstanding Compositing in a Televised Program, Music Video or Commercial, for the work they did on the second season episode "Accelerate". That same year, they won for Outstanding Matte Painting in a Televised Program, Music Video, or Commercial for season twos "Insurgence".[145]In 2002, the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers honored composer Mark Snow and the band Remy Zero, who provide the opening theme song "Save Me", for their contributions to the show. The award is given to individuals who wrote the theme or underscore for the highest rated television series during January 1  December 31, 2001 for their network.[146] The American Society of Cinematographers gave David Moxness an award for the work done on the sixth season episode "Arrow", and the following year they awarded Glen Winter the same award for his work on "Noir".[147] Members of the regular cast have won awards for their portrayals on the show. In 2001 Michael Rosenbaum won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor.[148] Tom Welling won a Teen Choice Award for Choice Breakout TV Star Male in 2002,[149] while Allison Mack was awarded Best Sidekick in 2006.[150] Mack won Best Sidekick for the second year in a row when she received the award in the 2007 Teen Choice Awards.[151] At the 2009 Teen Choice Awards, Tom Welling received the award for Choice TV Actor Action Adventure.[152]Smallville has spawned a multitude of additional media and spin-offs, from young adult novels and comic books to internet based mini-episodes featuring characters from the television series. Smallville was also the influence for the British television series Merlin.[153]There have been two series of novels published since the second season of the show began airing. A series of eight young adult novels was published by Aspect Publishing between October 2002 and March 2004. A second series of ten young adult novels was published by Little, Brown Young Readers between October 2002 and April 2004. In addition, a bi-monthly comic book series was published, which often tied directly into the events of the television show.Three novels were released on October 1, 2002, one from Aspect and two from Little, Brown Young Readers. Aspects novel, Smallville: Strange Visitors, was written by Roger Stern and featured Clark and his friends trying to uncover the truth about two religious con men who have set up shop in Smallville, and are using kryptonite in their spiritual seminars to rob the townspeople.[154] Little, Brown Young Readers first published Arrival, which chronicles the events of the shows pilot as written by author Michael Teitelbaum.[155] The second book, See No Evil, was written by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld, who have also written various episodes of the show. See No Evil follows Dawn Mills, a young actress who wants to attend Juilliard. Dawn has the ability to become invisible, and after witnessing everyone talk negatively behind her back she decides to get revenge. When Clark discovers what Dawn has been doing he puts a stop to it.[156] See No Evil was one of the original storylines outlined for the season one episode "Shimmer".[157]On November 1, 2002, Aspect released Alan Grants Smallville: Dragon, a story about an ex-convict who takes on the abilities and appearance of a dragon after being exposed to kryptonite in a cave. The mutation causes him to try to kill all those who testified against him. The novel features Clark being hypnotized into believing he is a normal, human teenager, with no abilities.[158] One month after Grants novel, Bennett and Gottesfeld returned for a second time to write Little, Brown Young Readers Flight, a story about a young girl, Tia, whom Clark discovers has full-sized wings. Clark and his friends believe Tia is being abused by her father, so they teach her to overcome her fear of flying so she can go find her mom.[159] Flight, like See No Evil, was also a planned episode at one point, but because the crew were not sure they could get the flying effects right they decided against using the story.[160] Nancy Holder took over writing duties for the third novel in the Aspect series. Released on January 1, 2003, Hauntings follows Clark and his friends as they investigate the ghostly presence in one of Smallvilles haunted houses.[161] Little, Brown Young Readers released Animal Rage next, written by David and Bobby Weiss. The story focuses on an animal rights activist, Heather Fox, who can transform into any animal she touches. Heather uses this ability to harm people who hurt animals, until Clark discovers the truth and stops her.[162] Aspect brought in Dean Wesley Smith for their next novel. Whodunit involves Clark, Chloe, Lana, and Pete investigating the murder of a boy and his sister, while Lex struggles with whether he will pay a ransom demand for his kidnapped father or simply try rescuing Lionel himself.[163]Little, Brown Young Readers published the next two books in April and June 2003. The first, titled "Speed", was written by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld. The second, titled "Buried Secrets", was written by Suzan Colon. Speed involves a boy using an hourglass his father gave him for his birthday to stop time and commit various hate crimes without getting caught. Clark stops him before he can cause any damage at a local multicultural festival.[164] Buried Secrets follows Clark and Lex as they both fall in love with a mind-reading substitute Spanish teacher. In the novel, Clark and Lexs friendship is put in jeopardy as the two compete for the teachers love.[165]On September 9, 2004, Aspect published Shadows, written by Diana G. Gallagher. Shadows is about a girl and her father who move to Smallville. The father creates a monster which begins killing people. Jonathan Kent assumes the deaths are LuthorCorp related, which causes tension between him and his son. Clark ascertains the truth to prove Lexs innocence, and stops the creatures before they can kill again.[166] Colon returned to write Runaway, a story about Clark running away to the city and living with other homeless teenagers. Clark falls in love with one of the girls before eventually returning home.[167] Smallville: Silence was written by Nancy Holder, and features the characters investigating the appearance of zombies in town.[168] Little, Brown Young Readers released their eighth book, written by Bennett and Gottesfeld, titled Greed. In this novel, Clark and his friends take jobs as summer counselors to disadvantaged youths. One of the boys falls into Crater Lake and is imbued with the ability to foretell the future. Lionel learns of this and tries to exploit it. Pete tries to abuse Clarks abilities by tricking him into playing in a basketball game and then betting on the outcome.[169]Alan Grant returned for a second outing to write Curse, about a grave digger who unleashes a 150-year-old curse onto Smallville, with Clarks attempting to put everything back to the way it was.[170] On February 1, 2004, Little, Brown Young Readers released a new book by Suzan Colon, entitled Temptation. In the novel, Clark uses red kryptonite to try to impress Lana and Chloe after they become infatuated with a new French foreign exchange student.[171] Aspect released their final novel on March 1, 2004. Written by Devin K. Grayson, City follows Clark and Lex as they take a trip to Metropolis. While in the city, the pair get caught between the Japanese mafia and a secret agent who believes he has found an alien.[172] In Little, Brown Young Readers final novel, "Sparks", written by Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld, Chloe is hit by kryptonite sparks from a fireworks display. The sparks make Chloe the desire of every man, but when they wear off, one of them decides he really does want Chloe and kidnaps her. Clark comes to her rescue in the end.[173]Before the start of season two, DC Comics published a one-shot comic based on the television series. Simply titled Smallville: The Comic, the issue features two stories. The first, written by Mark Verheiden and Roy Martinez, is titled "Raptor" and features an abused boy who is mutated into a Raptor, thanks to kryptonite, and decides to seek revenge on the Luthor family. Michael Green and John Paul Leon wrote the second story, "Exile and The Kingdom", which provides insight into why Lex chose to stay in Smallville after his father offered him a position in Metropolis at the end of season one.[174] Eventually, DC Comics began publishing a bi-monthly comic featuring various stories involving the characters from Smallville. Writer and script coordinator Clint Carpenter described the comic book line as a companion piece to the show, instead of a non-canon version of the characters. Carpenter said the comic book line expands on events which occurred in the show, like showing what happens after season-ending cliffhangers. Carpenter saw the comics as providing "additional depth" to those characters who received limited screen time on the show, or whose storylines needed additional explanation.[175]Carpenter was not the first person asked to oversee the comic. Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-shot comic, was originally going to be in charge of the bi-monthly series. Verheiden's commitment to the television series kept him from working on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take on the responsibility. Although the series was meant to expand on the events of the show, occasionally there were continuity errors created because of the differences in production schedules between the comic and the show. One such instance occurred when the comic book showed Clark robbing an ATM, while the season three premiere showed him robbing multiple ATMs.[175] The series not only tied into the television show, but also the Chloe Chronicles webisodes[176] and the various Smallville-related webpages.[175] In addition, the comics featured interviews with the cast and crew as well as information on the production of the episodes.[174][177]It was announced on February 8, 2012, that a Smallville season eleven comic book would be published by DC Comics. The series would first be released digitally and then collected into a three issue print edition once a month. The first digital issue was released on April 13, 2012, and the first print issue on May 2, 2012.[178] In the comic book, written by Bryan Q. Miller, who also served as executive story editor for the television series, set six months after Darkseid's attack, Clark no longer fights crime by the alias "The Blur", but has been dubbed "Superman" by the masses. He also altered the costume that Martha made for him during the television series. As Clark enjoys the general acceptance from the public, there are people who distrust him, including Lex Luthor, despite the fact that he lost his memories after his last encounter with Tess Mercer.[179] Despite being dead, Tess's consciousness is revealed to be bonded to Lex's mind after she poisoned him and has been plaguing his thoughts since.[180]Allison Mack's character, Chloe Sullivan, has starred in two promotional tie-in series, Smallville: Chloe Chronicles, and Vengeance Chronicles. There were two volumes of "Chloe Chronicles" totaling eleven mini-episodes. The first volume featured Chloe investigating events which led to the death of Earl Jenkins, who held Chloe and her friends hostage at the LuthorCorp plant in the first season episode "Jitters". It aired between April 29 and May 20, 2003, and was exclusive to AOL subscribers.[181] After the first volume received positive responses from viewers, the second volume was created as a continuation, but with Sam Jones III appearing as Pete Ross. This volume used the Smallville comic books as a secondary tie-in to the series. Viewers could watch Smallville, followed by Chloe's Chronicles, and finish with the Smallville comic book, which would provide an "enhanced backstory to the online segments".[182] The later series, Vengeance Chronicles, is a spin-off of the fifth season episode "Vengeance". In this series, Chloe joins forces with a costumed vigilante, whom she dubs the "Angel of Vengeance", to expose Lex Luthor's Level 33.1 experiments on meteor-infected people.[183]The idea for an online show centered on Chloe came from Mark Warshaw, who ran the show's website and was in charge of the DVDs. The series was intended to wrap up "unfinished business" from the television show.[184] Although Smallville: Chloe Chronicles first began airing on AOL, it eventually made its way to the United Kingdom's Channel 4 website.[184] According to Lisa Gregorian, senior vice president, television, Warner Bros. Marketing Services, "Our goal is to create companion programming that offers new and exciting ways to engage the audience, just as music videos did for record promotion."[181] Allison Mack described the show as "very Nancy Drew and mysterious", and saying, "I think its a bit more like The X-Files or NYPD Blue. The Chronicles are like a detective story, with Chloe following clues and interviewing people, going from spot to spot, figuring things out."[184] The scripts were written by Brice Tidwell, but Mack was given script approval for the series, allowing her to review and make changes to the script as she saw fit. Warshaw communicated regularly with Gough and Millar so he could find unique ways to expand Smallville stories over to Chloes Chronicles.[184]For the season three premiere, the Smallville producers teamed up with Verizon to provide its registered users the chance to view plot updatesin the form of a press release from The Daily Planetas well as quizzes and games related to the show. As part of the deal, Verizon products and services were placed in various episodes of the show.[185] In a promotional tie-in with Sprint, Smallville Legends: The Oliver Queen Chronicles was released. The six-episode CGI series chronicled the early life of Oliver Queen. According to Lisa Gregorian, Executive Vice President of worldwide marketing at Warner Bros. Television Group, these promotional tie-ins were ways to get fans more connected to the show.[186] On April 19, 2007, a tie-in with Toyota promoting their new Yaris featured an online comic strip as interstitial programs during new episodes of Smallville, titled Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom.[187] The interactive comic was based on the episode "Justice", which follows the adventures of Oliver Queen, Bart Allen, Victor Stone, and Arthur Currythe initial members of the "Justice League" in Smallvilleas they seek to destroy all of LuthorCorp's secret experimental labs. The online series allowed viewers to investigate alongside the fictional team, in an effort to win prizes. Stephan Nilson wrote all five of the episodes while working with a team of artists on the illustrations. The plot for each comic episode was given to Nilson as the production crew for Smallville was filming their current television episode. Artist Steve Scott drew comic book panels, which were then sent to a group called Motherland. That group reviewed the drawings and told Scott which images to draw on a separate overlay. This allowed for multiple objects to be moved in and out of the same frame.[188]In 2008 The CW entered into a partnership with the makers of Stride brand chewing-gum to give viewers the opportunity to create their own Smallville digital comic, titled Smallville: Visions.[189] The writers and producers developed the comic's beginning and end, but allowed viewers to provide the middle. The CW began their tie-in campaign with the March 13, 2008 episode "Hero", where Pete develops superhuman elasticity after chewing some kryptonite-infused Stride gum. Going to The CW's website, viewers vote on one of two optionseach adding four pages to the comicevery Tuesday and Thursday until the campaign ended on April 7, 2008.[190] For season seven, Smallville again worked with Sprint, bringing its customers "mobisodes" featuring Clark's cousin Kara, titled Smallville Legends: Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton.[191][192]Smallville creators Al Gough and Miles Millar developed an Aquaman pilot for The WB, with Justin Hartley as Aquaman/Arthur Curry.[193] As work progressed on the Smallville season five episode "Aqua", the character was recognized as having potential for his own series,[194] even though the episode was never meant to be a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman television spin-off.[195] Alan Ritchson was not considered for the role in the new series, because Gough and Millar did not consider it a spin-off from Smallville. Gough said in November 2005, "[The series] is going to be a different version of the 'Aquaman' legend."[194] Gough did express the idea of a crossover with Smallville at some point.[196] The pilot was considered to have a good chance of being picked up, but when The WB and UPN merged into The CW, the new network passed on the show.[197][198][199]During the sixth season, there was talk of spinning off the Green Arrow into his own series. Hartley refused to talk about the possibility of a spin-off out of respect for his role on Smallville. The actor felt it was his duty to respect what the show had accomplished in five seasons, and not "steal the spotlight" by thinking he was better than he was just because there was "talk" of a spin-off after only two appearances on the show. According to Hartley, "talking" was as far as the spin-off idea ever got.[200]Seasons one through ten have been released on DVD in Region 1, 2 and 4. Seasons five and six were also released in the now-obsolete HD DVD format on November 28, 2006,[201] and September 18, 2007,[202] respectively. Seasons six, seven, eight, nine and ten have been released on Blu-ray formats. The DVD releases include deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and commentary by cast and crew members on selected episodes. The promotional tie-ins, Chloe Chronicles and Vengeance Chronicles, accompanied the season two, three, and five box sets. Other special features include interactive functionality, such as a tour of Smallville, a comic book, and DVD-ROM material.[203]Since Smallville first began airing, an array of merchandise tying into the series has been released. Two soundtrack albums have been released compiling various songs that appeared on the show. On February 25, 2003, Smallville: The Talon Mix was released featuring a selected group of artists that licensed their music to the show.[250] On November 8, 2005, Smallville: The Metropolis Mix was released, featuring another selected group of artists.[251] Apart from the soundtracks encompassing various songs from the series' episodes, there have been action figures, T-shirts, hats, and posters created and marketed.[252] In December 2002, selected autographed Smallville merchandise was placed up for auction on eBay, with the proceeds going to charity.[253] In 2003, Titan publishing began releasing the Smallville magazine, a monthly magazine featuring interviews with the cast and crew, information on Smallville merchandise, and photos. Titan released the 34th issue of the Smallville magazine in November 2009, the final issue.[254]Titan Books published companion books for each of the seasons, which contained interviews with the cast and crew, descriptions of the episodes, and behind-the-scenes photos. On September 1, 2004, Titan Books released their first official companion for the series.[255] Written by Paul Simpson, the book contains sixteen pages of color photos of the cast.[256] On March 1, 2005, Titan Books released their companion for season two, also written by Simpson.[257] The season two companion goes into more detail about the special effects used on the show.[258] On September 1, 2005, Titan Books released the third season official companion.[259] This was the last companion written by Simpson. Apart from the episodes' general plots, Simpson discussed the lack of use of the Martha Kent character, and why the Adam Knight storyline did not pan out.[260] After two years, Titan Books released the fourth season companion on September 4, 2007,[261] written by Craig Byrne, who also wrote the subsequent companion books. It contains interviews with the cast and crew, but this time the color spread contains images of the production itself.[262] On December 26, 2007, Titan Books released the season five companion.[263] On March 25, 2008, Titan Books released their sixth official companion for Smallville. The season six companion contains an introduction from Justin Hartley.[264] The season seven companion would be the final book released by Titan. It contains a foreword from Laura Vandervoort, along with a reflection on the "Smallville phenomenon" and a discussion of the departure of Gough and Millar as executive producers and showrunners.[265]In 2010, a role playing game was released by Margaret Weis Productions using their Cortex System. It uses the setting of the show in season nine, with rules for earlier seasons. Supplements to the game have been produced. Players can play the characters from Smallville, or create their own spin-off of the show that has as much or as little connection to the show as they like.[266]Smallville at TV.comDramaSuperheroScience fictionCharacters:Jerry SiegelJoe ShusterAlfred GoughMiles MillarAlfred GoughMiles MillarMike TollinBrian RobbinsJoe DavolaKen HortonGreg BeemanJames MarshallTodd SlavkinDarren SwimmerKelly SoudersBrian PetersonTom WellingThe WB (200106)The CW (200611)1 Series overview2 Cast3 Production

He uses his abilities to help others in danger. Clark's problems in season one include not being able to share his secret with anyone and his desire for a normal life. After months of scouting, Welling was cast as Clark.[18] David Nutter had to convince Welling's manager that the role would not hurt Welling's film career in order to get Welling to read the pilot script. After reading the script, Welling was convinced to audition.[4]Kristin Kreuk portrays Lana Lang, the girl next door. She has a "hole in her heart" because of the loss of her parents, and feels empathy for everyone. She feels connected to Clark.[19] Kreuk was the first to be cast after Nutter saw an audition tape the actress had sent.[4] Kreuk left the series after the seventh season,[20] but returned for five episodes in season eight as a guest star.[21]Michael Rosenbaum portrays Lex Luthor, a billionaire's son sent to Smallville to run the local fertilizer plant. After Clark saves his life, the two quickly become friends.[22] As the series progresses, his friendship with Clark crumbles until the pair consider themselves enemies. The role was hard to cast, as no one could agree on who they liked for the role.[5] Michael Rosenbaum twice auditioned for the role of Lex Luthor. Feeling he did not take his first audition seriously, Rosenbaum outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene, indicating all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing.[23] His audition went so well that everyone agreed he was "the guy".[5] Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons,[20][24] but reprised his role for the series finale.[25]Allison Mack portrays Chloe Sullivan, one of Clark's best friends. She is in love with Clark, although the feeling is not reciprocated.[26] Editor of the school newspaper, her journalistic curiosity, always wanting to "expose falsehoods" and "know the truth",[27] causes tension with her friends, especially when she investigates Clark's past.[28] After learning about Smallville from Dee Dee Bradley, the show's casting director, Mack thought about auditioning for the role of Lana Lang. Mack instead auditioned twice for the role of Chloe Sullivan.[27] The character was created just for the series,[5] and was intended to have an "ethnic background" before Mack was hired.[27] She has since appeared in the comic book.[29]Sam Jones III portrays Pete Ross, another of Clark's best friends. He is the first person Clark voluntarily informs of his secret.[30] He is in love with Chloe,[31] which he keeps to himself because of the Clark-Lana-Chloe love triangle already taking place.[32] Ross was written out of the series at the end of season three, but made a guest appearance in season seven. Jones was the last of the series regulars to be cast. Gough and Millar saw Jones four days before they began filming the pilot.[32] In the comics, Ross is Caucasian, but the producers chose to cast Jones, who is African-American, against the mythology.[32]Annette O'Toole portrays Martha Kent, Clark's adoptive mother. She, along with her husband Jonathan, give Clark sage advice about how to cope with his growing abilities. In season five, she takes a state senate seat.[33] In season six the character exits from the show.[34] Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, but during filming everyone, including Ettinger, realized she was not right for the role.[5] O'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger was filming the original pilot. Around the time the creators were looking to recast the role of Martha Kent, The Huntress was canceled, allowing O'Toole to join the cast of Smallville.[35] O'Toole had previously portrayed Lana Lang in Superman III.[36]John Schneider portrays Jonathan Kent, Clark's adoptive father. He goes to great lengths to protect his son's secret. According to Schneider, Jonathan is "perfectly willing to go to jail, or worse, to protect his son."[37] Schneider was written out of the show on the series' 100th episode, with Jonathan dying of a heart attack the night of his election victory.[38] Millar and Gough wanted a recognizable face for Smallville. They loved the idea of casting Schneider as Jonathan, because he was already known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard, which Gough saw as adding to the belief that Schneider could have grown up running a farm.[5]Eric Johnson portrays Whitney Fordman, Lana's boyfriend in season one, who becomes jealous of Clark and Lana's budding friendship, going so far as to haze Clark.[22] He eventually reconciles with Clark, before joining the Marines and going off to Afghanistan.[39] Whitney was written out of the show in the first season's finale, but he made cameo appearances in the season two episode "Visage", where it is revealed he was killed in action, and the season four episode "Faade", during a flashback to Clark's freshman year. Johnson has expressed his pleasure in the way the writers handled Whitney's departure, by giving the character the exit of a hero.[40] Johnson auditioned for the roles of Lex and Clark, before finally being cast as Whitney.[41]John Glover portrays Lionel Luthor, Lex's father. Lionel is responsible for the Kents being able to adopt Clark without any legal ramifications or questions about his origins.[28] Glover tried to make Lionel appear as though he was trying to "toughen [Lex] up". Glover saw the character as a rich and powerful businessman who was disappointed in his son and attempts to make Lex tougher.[42] Lionel was created specifically for the show to provide a parallel to the Kents, and to portray an "experiment in extreme parenting."[5] After being a recurring guest during the show's first season, Glover became a series regular from seasons two to seven until Lionel was murdered by Lex towards the end of the seventh season,[43] but returns as a parallel universe version of the character in the tenth and final season.[44]Jensen Ackles portrays Jason Teague, a love interest for Lana, in season four. He follows Lana to Smallville, from Paris, France, and takes a position as the school's assistant football coach.[45] He was fired from the school when his relationship with Lana came to light. By the end of the season, it is revealed he had been working with his mother to track the three Kryptonian stones of knowledge.[46] Ackles received top billing for season four and was contracted to remain through season five, but was written out of the show in season four's finale due to his commitments to Supernatural.[47]Erica Durance portrays Lois Lane, Chloe's cousin. She comes to Smallville investigating the supposed death of Chloe.[9] She stays with the Kents while in town. Durance was a recurring guest for season four, but afterward became a series regular. The producers were always looking to bring Lois Lane to the series, and the supposed death of Chloe in the season three finale seemed like the right time to bring her to the show. Durance was cast just three days before filming began, and initially was only able to appear in four episodes based on a stipulation from the film division of Warner Bros. After discussion, the character was cleared for more episodes.[48]Aaron Ashmore portrays Jimmy Olsen, Chloe's photographer boyfriend; he also works at the Daily Planet. Ashmore was a recurring guest for season six but became a regular cast member in season seven. Ashmore indicates his casting was a welcomed surprise. The actor states, "I auditioned for [the role] and I put myself on tape. I hadn't heard anything, and a couple of weeks later, all of the sudden (sic), I got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville.' It's a dream come true, really."[49] After three seasons on the show, two as a series regular, Ashmore's character was killed off. Although "Jimmy Olsen" was murdered, Ashmore stated that his Jimmy was not the "real" Jimmy Olsen and that the character's younger brother, who appears briefly in the season eight finale, is intended to be the Jimmy who works alongside Clark and Lois.[50] Ashmore returns to play the real, younger Jimmy, in the show's final episode.Laura Vandervoort portrays Kara, Clark's Kryptonian cousin. She was sent to look after Kal-El (Clark), but was stuck in suspended animation for eighteen years. When the dam confining her ship broke in the season six finale, "Phantom", she was set free. She has all of Clark's abilities, including the ability to fly.[51] At the end of the seventh season, Kara was shown trapped in the Phantom Zone. Vandervoort was not brought back as a series regular for the eighth season,[52] but she did a guest appearance to wrap up her storyline in season eight's "Bloodline" and later in season ten's "Supergirl" and "Prophecy".[53]Justin Hartley portrays Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, the CEO of Queen Industries and leader of a small group of superheroes. Hartley was a recurring guest in the sixth and seventh seasons and became a series regular in season eight.[15] Hartley was the producers' first choice to play Oliver Queen. He was designed to shake up the lives of both Clark and Lois in season six, as well as provide Clark with an alternate view of how to fight crime.[54]Samuel Witwer portrays Davis Bloome in season eight. He is a "charismatic" paramedic struggling with a darkness inside of him.[55] Davis Bloome is Smallville's interpretation of Doomsday, the only character to have succeeded at killing Superman. Witwer explained that Davis would come to resemble his comic book counterpart over the course of the season.[56] Brian Peterson explained that, with Michael Rosenbaum's departure, the new executive producers were looking for a villainous character that was "as great as Lex", and Doomsday fit what they were looking for.[57]Cassidy Freeman portrays Tess Mercer, Lex's handpicked successor to being CEO of LuthorCorp in season eight.[55] The name "Tess Mercer" is a homage to two characters from Superman lore, Eve Teschmacher and Mercy Graves.[58] As Freeman describes her character, Mercer is Lex's handpicked successor; she is "fierce", "fun", and "intelligent". Mercer's primary goal for season eight was finding Lex. Her attention is drawn to Clark, whom she believes will be able to help her.[59] In the season ten episode "Abandoned", it is revealed that her birth name is Lutessa Lena Luthor, and that she is the illegitimate daughter of Lionel.[citation needed]Callum Blue portrays Zod, an early version of the criminal from Krypton who was expelled to the Phantom Zone prison. His character is first mentioned in season five, when Brainiac uses Lex's body as a physical vessel for Zod's spirit to inhabit. Later, he appears from within a Kryptonian orb in the season eight finale.[60] The executive producers classify this incarnation as "Major Zod", as opposed to his typical "General Zod" identifier, and reveal throughout season nine "the venomous side of Zod rises because he experiences a few key betrayals with our beloved characters".[61]Official websiteOfficial MySpace pageTown of Smallville, KansasSmallville at the Internet Movie DatabaseThe template Tv.com is being considered for deletion.KryptonSiteSmallville Wiki at Wikia.com  A Smallville wiki encyclopediaThe Vampire Diaries is a supernatural drama television series developed by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec, based on the book series of the same name written by L. J. Smith. The series premiered on The CW Television Network on September 10, 2009. The series takes place in Mystic Falls, Virginia, a fictional small town haunted by supernatural beings. The main focus of the series is the love triangle between the protagonist Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev) and vampire-brothers Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley) and Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder). As the narrative develops in the course of the series, the focal point shifts on the mysterious past of the town involving Elena's malevolent doppelgnger Katherine Pierce and the family of Original Vampires, all of which have an evil agenda of their own.The pilot episode attracted the largest audience of any series premiere since the network began in 2006.[1] The first season averaged 3.60 million viewers.[2] The show initially received average reviews, but critics agreed that the series improved over the course of the season with both the second and third season premiering to generally favorable reviews. The show has received numerous award nominations, winning two People's Choice Award and many Teen Choice Awards. On April 26, 2011, The CW renewed the series for a third season which began on September 15, 2011.[3]On May 3, 2012, The CW renewed the series for a fourth season, which began on October 11, 2012.[4]The series follows the life of Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev) a 17-year-old girl, who falls deeply in love with a 162-year-old vampire named Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley). Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated as Stefan's vicious, and malevolent older brother Damon Salvatore (Ian Somerhalder) returns with a plan to wreak havoc on the town and a revenge against his younger brother. Both brothers begin to show affection towards Elena, mainly because of her resemblance to their past love Katherine Pierce. It is revealed that Elena is a descendant of Katherine, who eventually returns with plans against the trio.The series is set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia, a town charged with supernatural history since its settlement of migrants from New England in the late 17th century. Other story lines revolve around the other inhabitants of the town, most notably Elena's younger brother Jeremy Gilbert (Steven R. McQueen), her best friends Bonnie Bennett (Katerina Graham) and Caroline Forbes (Candice Accola) and their mutual friends Tyler Lockwood (Michael Trevino) and Matt Donovan (Zach Roerig). The town's politics are orchestrated by descendants of the original founding families, all comprising a "Founders' Council". Some of the founding families of Mystic Falls include the Salvatores, the Gilberts, the Fells, the Forbes and the Lockwoods. They guard the town mainly from vampires, although there are other supernatural threats such as werewolves, witches, ghosts and hybrids.Although the show is based on the books of the same name, many of the characters are changed, although the main story lines from the original books are maintained. Beginning in season one, ten characters received star billing, with one being written out and another being promoted.Nina Dobrev portrays Elena Gilbert, the main protagonist, and her doppelgnger Katherine Pierce, also known as Katerina Petrova, who was originally the main antagonist of the second season, but as the season progresses she becomes the secondary antagonist of the second season.[5]Paul Wesley portrays Stefan Salvatore,[6] a good-hearted and affectionate vampire, and the complete opposite of his older brother, Damon Salvatore.Damon is portrayed by Ian Somerhalder,[7] the malevolent vampire brother who, in the beginning, serves as the show's anti-hero; however he shows a kinder, more caring side as the series progresses. Later in the series, Stefan reverts to his old ways as a Ripper and his role becomes more antagonistic.Other cast members include Steven R. McQueen, who portrays Jeremy Gilbert,[8] Elena's younger brother, later revealed to be her biological cousin, with Sara Canning acting as Jeremy and Elena's aunt and legal guardian, Jenna Sommers who is killed at the end of the second season after being turned into a vampire.[9] Katerina Graham portrays Bonnie Bennett, Elena's best friend, who is also a witch.[10] Candice Accola portrays Caroline Forbes,[11] Elena's other best friend who was insecure and her occasional rival at first but becomes a vampire in the second season, making her more mature as a person. Zach Roerig portrays Matt Donovan,[12] Elena's childhood friend and ex-boyfriend, who later becomes romantically involved with Caroline. Michael Trevino portrays Tyler Lockwood,[13] a werewolf later turned into a hybrid, Jeremy's rival, Matt's best friend and son of the mayor of Mystic Falls; male members of his family have been shown to carry a lycanthropic trait. Kayla Ewell portrayed Vicki Donovan,[14] Matt's troubled older sister and girlfriend of Tyler and then Jeremy. She was written out of the show in the seventh episode of the first season, after being turned into a vampire by Damon and killed by Stefan. Soon afterwards Matthew Davis joined the cast as Alaric Saltzman,[15] a history teacher, vampire hunter, and love interest for Jenna. Joseph Morgan joins the main cast in season three, after being a guest star in season two, as Original Vampire Klaus, the main antagonist of the second and third season.Initially, Kevin Williamson had little interest in developing the series, finding the premise too similar to other vampire tales. However, at Julie Plec's urging, he began to read the novels and started to become intrigued by the story: "I began to realize that it was a story about a small town, about that town's underbelly and about what lurks under the surface."[16] Williamson has stated the town's story will be the main focus of the series, rather than high school.[17]On February 6, 2009, Variety announced that The CW had green-lit the pilot for The Vampire Diaries with Williamson and Julie Plec set as the head writers and executive producers.[18] On May 19, 2009, the series was officially ordered for the 20092010 season.[19]The pilot episode was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, but the rest of the episodes have been filmed in Covington, Georgia (which doubles as the fictional small town of Mystic Falls, Virginia) and various other communities around Greater Atlanta,[20] to take advantage of local tax incentives.On the morning of May 10, 2012, a fire broke out in the building on Clark Street in Covington that was used as the setting for Mystic Grill on the show.[21]The series was given a full, 22-episode order on October 21, 2009 after strong ratings for the first half of the season.[22]On February 16, 2010, The CW announced that it had renewed the show for a second season,[23] which premiered on September 9, 2010.[24] On April 26, 2011, The CW renewed the show for a third season.[3] The third season premiered on September 15, 2011.[25] The fourth season premiered October 11, 2012.President of The CW Mark Pedowitz said in an interview at the summer TCA's that The Vampire Diaries didn't receive an extra episode order at the request of Kevin Williamson. "Kevin Williamson felt to do the best show possible he would rather do 22. I'd rather have a great 22 than a good 24 if Kevin couldn't do it," he explained.[26] The Vampire Diaries initially received mixed reviews. Metacritic gave the show a Metascore of 50 based on 22 critical reviews, indicating mixed to average reviews.[27] Entertainment Weekly gave the pilot a B+, declaring that the show "signals a welcome return to form for writer-producer Kevin Williamson". Reviewer Ken Tucker ended his review by writing that "Diaries promises us a season of sharp-tongued amusement."[28] Linda Stasi of the New York Post gave the premiere a perfect score, saying that she was "hooked after one episode". Stasi praised the pacing of the episode and the "vicious, bloody vamp action", which "starts in the opening scene and continues throughout The Vampire Diaries with such ferocity and speed that it's truly scary."[29] Conversely, San Francisco Chronicle's Tim Goodman gave the episode a highly critical review, calling the series "awful". Goodman disliked the dialogue and hoped that the extras on Buffy the Vampire Slayer would "return en masse to eat the cast of Vampire Diaries, plus any remaining scripts."[30]Many TV critics felt the series improved with each episode. Sarah Hughes of The Independent says The Vampire Diaries turns into "a well-crafted, interestingly developed series", despite a poor opening episode.[16] The New York Post also praised the portrayal of Elena, finding the character to be a strong-minded woman who did not allow her feelings for her boyfriend to control her.[31] Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune said that "the supernatural drama is a first-class production, featuring an insanely gorgeous cast, sharp scripts and a brooding vibe that is hard for even the most levelheaded adult to resist."[32] Mike Hale of The New York Times gave the series an honorable mention on his list of the top TV shows of 2009.[33]The show's second season opened to universal acclaim from professional television critics as it received a 78/100 score on Metacritic. As the series progressed and developed onto the third season, critics praised the portrayals of the main characters and the development of the female characters such as Elena Gilbert played by Nina Dobrev and Caroline Forbes who is played by Candice Accola.The third season finale, The Departed, opened to generally positive reviews. Diana Steenbergen of IGN praised the episode and the writers for clearing up a couple story lines and making all of them come to a head. She also praised Dobrev's performance in this episode, addressing her behaviour as another reason the final revelation from Meredith was more shocking and believable. Similarly, Mandi Bierly of Entertainment Weekly review praised the writer's skills in creating the more unexpected final twist.The series premiere on September 10, 2009 gave The CW its biggest series premiere scoring 4.91 million viewers.[34] Adding in DVR numbers, the ratings for the premiere swelled to an official 5.7 million viewers.[35] The following is a table for the seasonal rankings, based on average total estimated viewers per episode, of The Vampire Diaries on The CW.

It is one of the longest-running scripted television programs in the world, airing nearly every weekday in the United States since November 8, 1965.[3] It has since been syndicated to many countries around the world.[4][5][6] It also rebroadcasts on SOAPnet with the most recent NBC episode airing weeknights at 8 and 11 p.m. (ET/PT). The series was created by husband-and-wife team Ted Corday and Betty Corday.[1] Irna Phillips was a story editor for Days of our Lives and many of the show's earliest storylines were written by William J. Bell. The show was renewed through September 2013 with a network option for 2014.Due to the series' success, it was expanded from 30 minutes to 60 minutes on April 21, 1975. From that date, for the next 37 years the mid-show bumper, featuring the phrase "We will return for the second half of Days of our Lives in just a moment" was aired every episode and voiced by the series' original star, Macdonald Carey. This mid show bumper aired until it was finally retired on January 20, 2012.The series focuses on its core families, the Hortons and the Bradys.[7] Several other families have been added to the cast, and many of them still appear on the show. Frances Reid, the matriarch of the series' Horton family remained with the show from its inception to her death on February 3, 2010.[8] Suzanne Rogers celebrated 39 years on Days of our Lives this year, appearing on the show more or less since her first appearance in 1973.[9] Susan Seaforth Hayes is the only cast member to appear on Days of our Lives in all six decades it has been on air.[10]Days of our Lives aired its 10,000th episode on February 21, 2005[11][12] and its 12,000th episode is due to air on January 11, 2013. The show was given the title of most daring drama in the seventies due to covering topics other soaps would not dare to do.[13] The show's executive producer is Ken Corday,[14] and co-executive producers are Greg Meng and Lisa de Cazotte. Days of our Lives is the most widely-distributed soap opera in the United States.[15] The original title sequence voiced by MacDonald Carey is still used to this day. The show has also been parodied by the television sitcom Friends, some cast members made crossovers on the show. Such would include Kristian Alfonso,[16] Roark Critchlow,[17] Matthew Ashford, Kyle Lowder, and Alison Sweeney.[18] The show has high profile fans such as actress Julia Roberts,[19] and the late Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall.[20]The Cordays and Bell combined the "hospital soap" idea with the tradition of centering a series on a family, by making the show about a family of doctors, including one who worked in a mental hospital.[21] Storylines in the show follow the lives of middle and upper-class professionals in Salem, a middle-America town, with the usual threads of love, marriage, divorce, and family life, plus the medical storylines and character studies of individuals with psychological problems.[22] Former executive producer Al Rabin took pride in the characters' passion, saying that the characters were not shy about "sharing what's in their gut."[23]Critics originally praised the show for its non-reliance on nostalgia (in contrast to shows such as As the World Turns) and its portrayal of "real American contemporary families."[24] By the 1970s, critics deemed Days of our lives to be the most daring daytime drama, leading the way in using themes other shows of the period would not dare touch, such as artificial insemination and interracial romance.[13] The January 12, 1976 cover of Time magazine featured Days of our Lives' Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes, the only daytime actors to ever appear on its cover.[25][26][27] The Hayeses themselves were a couple whose onscreen and real-life romance (they met on the series in 1970 and married in 1974) was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press.[28]In the 1990s, the show branched out into supernatural storylines, which critics immediately panned, as it was seen as a departure from more realistic storylines for which the show had originally become known. However, these storylines did have the desired effect, making Days of our Lives the most-watched daytime soap among young and middle-aged women, also becoming one of NBC's five most profitable shows in any time slot.[29][30] In 2006, when asked about his character, Jack Deveraux, "coming back from the dead"for the third timeactor Matthew Ashford responded, "It is hard to play that because at a certain point it becomes too unreal...actors look at that and think, 'What is this  the Cartoon Network'?"[31]Days of our lives, in addition to receiving critical acclaim in print journalism, has won a number of awards, including a Daytime Emmy for Best Drama in 1978[32] and a Writers Guild of America, East Award for Best Drama in 2000.[33] Days of our lives actors have also won awards: Macdonald Carey (Dr. Tom Horton) won Best Actor in 1974[34] and 1975,[35] Susan Flannery (Laura Horton) won Best Actress in 1975,[35] Suzanne Rogers (Maggie Horton), Leann Hunley (Anna DiMera), and Tamara Braun (Ava Vitali) won Best Supporting Actress for respectively 1979,[36] 1986, and 2009[37] and Billy Warlock (Frankie Brady) won Best Younger Actor for 1988.[38] In 2009, Darin Brooks (Max Brady) took home the Emmy for Best Younger Actor,"[39] and Tamara Braun (Ava Vitali) won for Best Supporting Actress,[40] the show's first acting victories in over 21 and 23 years, respectively[41]As with all other network programming, Days of our lives' ratings have declined somewhat since the 1990s. In January 2007 it was suggested by NBC that the show "is unlikely to continue [on NBC] past 2009."[42] In November 2008, in an eleventh-hour decision, it was announced the show had been renewed through September 2010. The 18-month renewal was down from its previous renewal, which was for five years. The show made somewhat of a comeback in 2009, with ratings increasing as the year progressed. In March 2010, the show was renewed once again through September 2011;[43][44] then again on November 8, 2010, its 45th anniversary, the show was renewed for two more years through September 2013, with an option for an additional year which would keep the soap on through 2014, its 49th year on the air.[45][46] Beginning on November 8, 2010, which marked Days of our Lives' 45th anniversary, the show began airing in high-definition.[47]When Days of our Lives premiered in 1965, the show revolved around the tragedies and triumphs of the suburban Horton family. Over time, additional families were brought to the show to interact with the Hortons and serve as springboards for more dramatic storylines. Originally led by patriarch Dr. Tom Horton and his wife, homemaker Alice, the Hortons remain a prominent fixture in current continuity. One of the longest-running storylines involved the rape of Mickey Horton's wife Laura by Mickey's brother Bill. Laura confides in her father-in-law Dr. Tom, and the two agree that her husband Mickey should never know. The secret, involving the true parentage of Michael Horton (a product of the rape) and Mickey's subsequent health issues as a result of the revelation, spanned episodes from 1968 to 1975. The storyline was the first to bring the show to prominence, and put it near the top of the Nielsen daytime ratings.[48] Another love triangle, between lounge singer Doug Williams, Tom and Alice's daughter Addie, and Addie's own daughter, Julie, proved to be very popular around the same time. The storyline culminated in the death of Addie in 1974 and the marriage of Doug and Julie in 1976.[49]In the early 1980s, the Brady and DiMera families were introduced, and their rivalry quickly cemented their places as core families in Salem beside the Hortons. Around the same time, with the help of head writers Sheri Anderson, Thom Racina, and Leah Laiman, action/adventure storylines and supercouples such as Bo and Hope, Shane and Kimberly, and Patch and Kayla reinvigorated the show, previously focused primarily on the domestic troubles of the Hortons. Since the 1990s, with the introduction of writer James E. Reilly, Days of our Lives has moved from traditional plots to some supernatural and science-fiction-themed stories, in conjunction with the rivalry of good vs. evil, in a Hatfield/McCoy feud style the Bradys versus the DiMeras. Under the tenure of Reilly, ratings rose to #2, and stayed there until he left in 1999 to start his own creation of Passions. Despite the introduction of new head writer Hogan Sheffer in 2006, ratings failed to revive, which led the show's producers to hire a few past fan favorites to stop the ratings hemorrhage.[50]In addition to the love triangles of Bill/Laura/Mickey and Addie/Doug/Julie, other memorable storylines include the 1968 story of amnesiac Tom Horton, Jr., who returns from Korea believing he is someone else and then proceeds to romance his younger sister Marie;[48] the 20-year tragic love triangle when John Black steals Marlena Brady from her husband Roman;[48] the 1982 "Salem Strangler" (Jake Kositchek, who was nicknamed "Jake the Ripper") who stalks and murders women;[48] the 1984 Gone with the Wind storyline in which Hope Williams Brady and Bo Brady hide out on a Southern plantation and dress up as Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler (devised to keep viewers tuned in while rival network ABC's soaps were preempted due to the 1984 Summer Olympics);[48][51] "The Cruise of Deception" in 1990, when madman Ernesto Toscano invites all his enemies aboard a ship, the S.S. Loretta, and holds them captive;[48] the shocking and ratings-grabbing 1993 plot when Vivian Alamain buried Dr. Carly Manning alive (the first controversial storyline from head writer Reilly);[52] and the 19941995 storyline in which the town's Christmas tree burns down and Marlena becomes possessed in Exorcist fashion.[29][48]From 1996-1998, the soap saw a lot of actress Eileen Davidson. Her character, Kristen Blake Dimera suffers a miscarriage in secret, and in a panic to keep John Black away from Marlena, pretends to still be pregnant with John's child. Stefano hires a doppelganger, Susan Banks to conceive and bear a child for her (which resulted in the birth of EJ "Elvis" DiMera). Eileen Davidson portrayed the entire Banks family clan, four in total (including one male), as well as her main character.[53][54][55]20032004's "Melaswen", saw several characters purportedly die at the hands of a masked psychopath, but are later revealed to have been kidnapped to the secret island of Melaswen (New Salem spelled backwards).[56] 2007's "Bradys and DiMeras: The Reveal", told the story regarding how the Brady/DiMera feud started.Past characters returned in June 2010 to honor the passing of matriarch Alice Horton, whose character died on June 23, 2010.[57] On June 23, 2011, Days of Our Lives introduced Sonny Kiriakis, the show's first contract gay character onto the canvas to be featured in the show's first gay storyline.[58] Freddie Smith (Sonny) said in an interview, "Hes very confident and mature, hes traveled the world and is very open-minded. Im very excited to portray him."[58] Subsequent to Sonny's arrival, Will Horton investigates his own sexuality, and reveals himself to be gay.[59] He later starts a romantic relationship with Sonny.[60]See Also: List of Days of our Lives cast membersWhen Days of our Lives debuted the cast consisted of seven main characters (Tom Horton, Alice Horton, Mickey Horton, Marie Horton, Julie Olson, Tony Merritt, and Craig Merritt).[61] When the show expanded to one-hour in April 1975, the cast increased to 27 actors. By the 25th anniversary in 1990, 40 actors appeared on the show in contract or recurring roles,[61] which is the approximate number of actors the show has used since then. Original cast member Frances Reid, who played Alice Horton, remained on contract with Days of our Lives through her death on February 3, 2010 though she last appeared on the show in December 2007.[1] Original cast member John Clarke, who played Mickey Horton, left the series in 2004. Suzanne Rogers, who plays Maggie Horton has been on the show since 1973, and Susan Seaforth Hayes has played Julie Olson Williams since 1968 with a few breaks in between and also her husband Bill Hayes, who has played Doug Williams since 1970, though neither Seaforth Hayes or Hayes is employed with the serial on contract.In recent years, Days of our lives has hired back many former cast members. Twenty of the current contract cast members have been with the show, off-and-on, since at least 1999. Since 2005, cast members from the 1980s and 1990s, such as Christie Clark (Carrie Brady), Stephen Nichols (Steve Johnson), Austin Peck (Austin Reed), Mary Beth Evans (Kayla Brady), Joseph Mascolo (Stefano DiMera), and Thaao Penghlis (Tony DiMera) have been brought back to Days of our Lives.[50] More additions to the show include the returns of Crystal Chappell (Dr. Carly Manning), and Louise Sorel as Vivian Alamain. In June 2010, characters such as Jennifer Horton, Bill Horton, Shane Donovan, and Kimberly Brady returned for a short time and were featured heavily in a tribute to Alice Horton. Guest cast members have included Elizabeth Alley. In late 2012, the show reintroduced actress Eileen Davidson in the role of Kristen Blake DiMera after a 14 year absence.The co-creator and original executive producer, Ted Corday, was only at the helm for eight months before dying of cancer in 1966. His widow, Betty, was named executive producer upon his death. She continued in that role, with the help of H. Wesley Kenney and Al Rabin as supervising producers, before she semi-retired in 1985. When Mrs. Corday semi-retired in 1985, and later died in 1987, her son, Ken, became executive producer and took over the full-time, day-to-day running of the show,[14] a title he still holds today. The series' current co-executive producers are Greg Meng and Lisa de Cazotte.The first long-term head writer, William J. Bell, started writing for Days of our Lives in 1966 and continued until 1975, a few years after he had created his own successful soap, The Young and the Restless. He stayed with the show as a storyline consultant until 1978. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many writing changes occurred. In the early 1980s, Margaret DePriest helped stabilize the show with her serial killer storyline. Later head writers, such as Sheri Anderson, Thom Racina, and Leah Laiman, built on that stability and crafted storylines of their own, temporarily bringing up ratings. Many writing changes occurred after Laiman left the series in 1989 and would not become stable again until James E. Reilly started with the show in 1993. His tenure, which lasted for four-and-a-half years, was credited with bringing ratings up to the second place spot in the Nielsens. Other writers who succeeded him, such as Sally Sussman Morina and Tom Langan, failed to keep the ratings success, and another writer turnover continued until Reilly returned to the series in 2003.Five-time Daytime Emmy winner Hogan Sheffer was named head writer with great fanfare in October 2006, but lasted less than 16 months with the show, with his last episode airing in January 2008. Current head writer Dena Higley's first episode aired on April 23, 2008.[62] Her co-head writer was Christopher Whitesell until Feb 2011. His replacement has yet to be named. On May 18, 2011 Dena Higley was fired. The new head writers are Marlene McPherson and Darrell Ray Thomas Jr.In April 2012 it was confirmed that McPherson and Thomas Jr. were fired from their positions as co-head writers. They are due to be replaced by Gary Tomlin and Christopher Whitesell.[63] It was later confirmed that former All My Children headwriter Lorraine Broderick would join Tomlin and Whitesell as a breakdown writer on the series.[64]Days of our Lives won the Daytime Emmy Award in June 2012 for Outstanding Drama Writing Team.[65]For the first three years on the air, Days of our Lives was near the bottom of the Nielsen ratings, and close to cancellation. However, its ascent to the top was rapid; as the 1969 TV season ended, it became an effective tool of NBC, which attempted to dethrone daytime leader CBS. By 1973 the show, pitted against CBS' popular Guiding Light and ABC's The Newlywed Game at 2 p.m.(EST)/1 p.m.(CST),[2] had matched the first-place ratings of As the World Turns and sister NBC dramatic serial Another World. Due to the success of the program, it expanded from a half hour to one hour on April 21, 1975. This expansion had followed the lead of Another World, which became TV's first-ever hour-long soap on January 6, three-and-a-half months earlier. Further, Days of our Lives' new starting time of 1:30/12:30[2] finally solved a scheduling problem that began in 1968 when NBC lost the game Let's Make a Deal to ABC, and in its wake, eight different shows were placed into the slot (Hidden Faces, You're Putting Me On, Life with Linkletter, Words & Music, Memory Game, Three on a Match, Jeopardy!, and How to Survive a Marriage).However, this first golden period for NBC daytime proved to be short-lived, as Days of our Lives' ratings began to decline in 1977. Much of the decline was due to ABC's expansion of its increasingly popular soap All My Children to a full hour, the last half of which overlapped with the first half of Days of Our Lives By January 1979, the network, in a mode of desperation more than anything else, decided to jump headlong against AMC and moved the show ahead to the same 1 p.m./12 Noon time slot.[2] In exchange to its affiliates for taking away the old half-hour access slot at 1/Noon, NBC gave them the 4 p.m./3 slot, which many (if not most) stations had been preempting for years anyway.[66] By 1986, ABC and CBS followed suit, under the intense pressure of lucrative (and cheap) syndicated programming offered to affiliates.By 1980, Days of our Lives had displaced Another World as NBC's highest-rated soap. However, the entire NBC soap lineup was in ratings trouble. In fact, by 1982, all of its shows were rated above only one ABC soap (The Edge of Night) and below all four CBS soaps. The "supercouple" era of the 1980s, however, helped bring about a ratings revival, and the 19831984 season saw Days of our Lives experience a surge in ratings. It held onto its strong numbers for most of the 1980s, only to decline again by 1990, eventually falling back into eighth place. In the mid-1990s, however, the show experienced a resurgence in popularity and the show reached number two in the ratings, where it remained for several years before experiencing another ratings decline beginning in 1999, the year that Days of our Lives became NBC's longest-running daytime program (upon the cancellation of Another World). Throughout the 2000s (decade), Days of our Lives and all the other remaining network daytime serials have witnessed a steady erosion of viewers, mainly due to vastly altered viewing habits induced by cable networks and alternative genres such as reality and talk shows on minor network affiliates.On January 17, 2007, NBC Universal Television president Jeff Zucker remarked that Days of our Lives would most likely not "continue past 2009."[42] This contributed to an immediate ratings decline for Days of our Lives. The show was averaging a 2.4 rating prior to the announcement, dropped to a 2.2 average household rating in the months after. In an April 2007 interview with Soap Opera Digest, executive producer Ken Corday commented on the ratings decline of the previous months, "If I don't pay attention to the ratings and what the viewers are saying, I'm an ostrich. I have not seen a decline in the ratings on the show this precipitous  ever. I've never seen this much of a percentage decline."[67] Since January 1993, WPXI-TV in Pittsburgh, PA airs Days weekdays during its 3:00 p.m. timeslot while some stations such as WJAC-TV in Johnstown, PA air the program during the 2:00 p.m. timeslot, but most stations continue to air Days at its 1 pm timeslot. With the cancellation of Passions, Days is now NBC's last remaining daytime soap opera.[68]Days of our Lives had finished the 2008-2009 television season with substantial increases in viewers (3.0 million vs. 2.8 million) and has risen to the #3 spot behind The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful, respectively. It was the #2 daytime program behind The Young and the Restless in the much coveted 18-49 demographic. During the first few months of the 2009-2010 season, Days of our Lives increased its average household rating to 2.4, and averaged consistently over 3,000,000 viewers. It was only one point behind the #2 daytime drama The Bold and the Beautiful, and has beat that soap on several days during the season. In 2010, Days of our Lives continued to increase viewership and has as high as 3.6 million viewers on several days. A substantial increase in viewership such as Days of our Lives has had lately, also bucks the viewership trend in daytime dramas, which had declined since the 1990s for all other daytime drama series. Days of our Lives is the only daytime drama series to increase in viewers between 2008 and 2010 and had reduced its operating budget, making it a profitable asset to NBC's broadcast line-up.[69]However starting in 2011, Days of our Lives started to lose ground significantly to the point that it sometimes occupied the last position among all soaps for both total viewership and the 18-49 women demographic. The ending of All My Children combined with the return of several cast members allowed a brief resurgence of Days of our Lives in October 2011, but ratings soon declined again. In December 2011, Days of Our Lives recorded three consecutive weeks of new lows in the 18-49 women key demo category.,[70][71][72][73] and again another consecutive three weeks of low ratings in the same demography during MarchApril 2012 [74][75][76]As of 2012, Days of Our Lives generally ranks #3 among the four daytime soap operas on the air when it comes to the total number of viewers (surpassing only General Hospital).[77][78] However, Days of Our Lives is last among all soap operas for the numbers of viewers in the targeted demographic of women aged between 18 and 49 years old.[77][78]According to Variety, Days of our Lives is the most widely-distributed soap opera in the United States, with episodes not just broadcast via NBC, but also via cable (SOAPnet), and as of June 2007, episodes are offered via iTunes.[15] and also has an international audience.In Australia, it started broadcasting locally on 25 March 1968 at 12 noon,[4] via the Nine Network. Over time, Days of our Lives ended up airing at a delay of nearly five years behind the United States due to cricket pre-emptions in the summer, so in 2004, Nine aired a special titled Days of our Lives: A New Day, which summarized four years of storyline in one hour, in an attempt to catch up to more current telecasts.[4] This speed-up caused mixed feelings as viewers missed many vital storylines and it landed right in the middle of the Melaswen storyline. Now, episodes are 16 months behind the United States and will eventually fall to again being years behind due to summer cricket.Throughout Canada, Days of our Lives currently airs at 1:00 pm on Global Television Network.[79] Episodes are aired in sync with the NBC broadcast to take advantage of simultaneous substitution regulations. However Global stations in the Prairies air the show a day before the U.S broadcast (Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg affiliates) The show also airs on Newfoundland's NTV at 1:30pm Newfoundland Standard Time.[80] Since September 5, 2011, French-language network TVA has aired the show in Quebec as a 30 minutes serial under the name Des jours et des vies; it premiered with episodes that originally aired on NBC in early 2002. The Quebec version is exactly the same translation as the one running in France which has been on the air since 2000.New Zealand has aired Days of our Lives nearly as long, debuting on Television New Zealand by 1975 at the latest,[5][81] and was currently running approximately five years behind the United States on TV ONE. TVNZ Stopped airing Days of our Lives on 19 May 2010 despite a national petition from fans, Sky has no plans to pick it up.In South Africa the soap airs on SABC 3 each weekday from 16:30 to 17:30. Episodes are currently 2 and a half years behind that of the USA.Days of our Lives also airs in a number of countries across Europe, premiering in Turkey on October 8, 1990, France on July 29, 1991, and since July 1998 after the end of Loving diffusion on France 2 (currently 6 years behind the U.S.), Germany on September 6, 1993, Denmark, Norway and Sweden in 1997 (currently four years behind the U.S.), Finland on August 11, 2003, and Hungary on June 14, 2004. Channel 5 aired episodes of Days of our Lives in the United Kingdom from March 2000 to April 2001, eventually pulling it off the air; network executives deemed its audience of 200,000 viewers as too low a figure.[6] Days had previously aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on the Sky Soap channel between 1994 and 1999; episodes were three years behind U.S. telecasts. Days of our Lives became available to viewers again in the United Kingdom in 2007 - to 2010; CBS Drama ended the run after relegating the show from daytime to 1.00am.In Italy Days of our Lives aired for only three months in 1985 on Rete A with the title Passano gli anni, passano i giorni; in 1992 Italia 7 started to air Days of our Lives with a new title, Il tempo della nostra vita, and new episodes, five years behind U.S. telecasts. In 1993, after 260 episodes, the show was cancelled.In Greece the show aired from 1994-1996 on Mega Channel (focusing on the Cruise of Deception storyline), 1997-2000 on Star Channel (broadcasting the 1992-1995 Reily era), and 2005-2006 on NET (with the first 320 episodes of the Salem Stalker/Melaswen storyline).On February 2011 the show continued on ET1 in a late night zone...In the Middle East and the Arab World, Days of our Lives aired on MBC2 before moving to MBC4, with episodes 5 years behind the U.S.Belize's Tropical Vision Limited features Days of our Lives as an afternoon staple. Currently it airs at 2:00 pm UTC-6 (Central Time), though it previously aired as early as 1:00 pm or as late as 5:30 pm as a lead in to the news.Almost unmodified since the show's debut in 1965, the title sequence of Days of our Lives features an hourglass, with sand slowly trickling to the bottom against the backdrop of a partly cloudy sky,[82] as well as the trademark voiceover, "Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives." From the show's debut in 1965 until March 1966, announcer Ed Prentiss spoke the phrase, adding "Days of our Lives, a new dramatic serial starring Macdonald Carey."[82] Since April 1966, the voice has been that of Macdonald Carey, who played Dr. Tom Horton from the show's premiere until the actor's 1994 death from lung cancer.[83] From 1966 to 1994, he would add "This is Macdonald Carey, and these are the days of our lives." After Carey's death in 1994, this second part was removed out of respect for Carey and his family.[82] His full introduction was restored during the 45th year anniversary show that aired on November 8, 2010.The theme that regularly accompanies each sequence was composed by Charles Albertine, Tommy Boyce, and Bobby Hart.[84] The theme has only been modified a few times since Days of our Lives premiered: in 1972, in 1993, when the opening titles were changed to computerized visuals, and in 2004, with an orchestral arrangement that was only used in eight episodes, at which time the theme was reverted to the 1993 arrangement. In 2009, the longtime 1993 version was retired and shortened. Beginning with the November 8, 2010 episode, there were slight changes to the coloring of the sky background in the sequence now being displayed in 16:9 widescreen. However, there was very little change in the sequence's appearance from the 1993 version.SCTV had a recurring soap opera sketch called "Days of the Week" which featured Martin Short and Andrea Martin.Days of our Lives was somewhat satirized (or perhaps merely referenced) on the hit NBC sitcom Friends when series regular Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) was cast as "Dr. Drake Ramoray" on the show,[85] and despite Joey living in New York when Days of our Lives is shot in California.[85] Subsequent episodes featured pseudo-Days of our Lives storylines invented for the sitcom, and included some guest appearances by real-life cast members from the soap opera. Joey's stint on the show ended when he angered the show's writers; his character was killed after falling down an elevator shaft.[86] Later, his character was brought back to life thanks to a brain transplant from the character Jessica Lockhart, played by Susan Sarandon.[87] Alison Sweeney (Sami Brady) appeared on Friends as faux Days character "Jessica Ashley,"[18] Kristian Alfonso as Hope Brady,[16] and Roark Critchlow as Mike Horton.[17] In an episode in which Joey hosts a "soap opera party" on the roof, Matthew Ashford and Kyle Lowder make appearances as his co-stars. In the spin-off sitcom Joey, Joey is nominated for "best death scene" after his character is stabbed while performing surgery.[88] The show was also parodied as "Light of our Love", or "LOOL", in the Nancy Drew video game Stay Tuned for Danger.Days of our Mornings is a long-running radio parody, broadcast weekday mornings on 5FM in South Africa.The show has had many high-profile fans. In 1976, TIME magazine reported that then-Justice of the Supreme Court, Thurgood Marshall, would call a recess around the 1 p.m. hour to watch Days of our Lives.[20] Actress Julia Roberts admitted at the 2002 People's Choice Awards that she was a fan of Days of our Lives, and asked to be seated near the cast at that event as well as other award shows. In 2004, during the show's Melaswen storyline, Roberts' interest was considered notable enough that Entertainment Weekly quoted her saying that "the show has gotten a little wacko."[19] A 1998 TIME article mentioned that Monica Lewinsky was a passionate fan of Days of our Lives, so much so that she wrote a poem about the series in her high school yearbook. The article compared her whirlwind experiences in the White House to a story on Days of our Lives.[89] Best-selling novelist Brian Keene has stated in interviews that he has watched the show since 1983, and pauses from writing each day during the hour it is on.[89]The Bold and

After a hiatus, 12 first-season episodes aired January 5, 2009 through March 23, 2009, despite being marketed as season 2, for a total of 23 episodes.[13] The first season was aired on Canadian broadcaster CityTV starting on September 3, 2008.[14] In early 2009, CityTV removed Secret Life from its schedule.[15] Therefore, MuchMusic started to air the first season in Canada on November 30, 2009, followed by the second season on December 7, 2009.[16]Following the success of its first season, ABC Family announced on January 31, 2009, plans to renew Secret Life.[17] The official press release was released on February 9 and was added to ABC Family's line up on April 7, 2009.[18] The show was renewed for a 24-episode second season, which began airing on June 22, 2009.[2][19][20] Season 2 began with 12 episodes broadcast starting June 22, 2009 through September 7, 2009. After a four-month hiatus, the second half of the season returned on January 4, 2010,[21] and concluded on March 22, 2010.[22]Following their record-breaking, mid-season returns, Make It or Break It, and Secret Life were both picked up for an additional season.[4] The third season premiere of Secret Life was aired on June 7, 2010, at 8pm.[5] On January 10, 2011, it was reported that Secret Life was picked up for a fourth season to be shown in Summer 2011 and season three would resume on March 28, 2011 after an extended season break.[23] The second half of the fourth season is set to air on March 26, 2012.On February 2, 2012 it was announced ABC Family renewed The Secret Life of the American Teenager for a fifth season.[24]Secret Life received mixed reviews at the time of its debut. It currently has a score of 47 out of 100 from review aggregator Metacritic.[25] The New York Post praised the series for having a set of characters that are "... real and come from families of all stripes  from intact to single-parent households to one boy in foster care..."[26] However, most mainstream critics haven't embraced the show, indicating it as a TV-series version of an after school special, "filled with didactic messages and a lotta wooden acting," in the words of Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly.[27] The New York Times claimed that "Secret Life" must surely be the collective effort of an anti-pregnancy cabal. [...] ABC Family means well but could not have done worse. "Secret Life" doesnt take the fun out of teenage pregnancy, it takes the fun out of television" and calls the show a "Prime-Time Cautionary Tale".[28] Variety Magazine reports that "ABC Family's latest original drama wants to be a slow-motion version of "Juno" but settles for being an obvious, stereotype-laden teen soap [...] based on first impressions, "The Secret Life of the American Teenager" should probably stay a secret."[29] ReporterMag's Andrew Rees says, "The show...might be the worst scripted drama on television. Suffering from gag-worthy dialog, horrific plot twists, terrible acting, and characters who not even the best of 3-D glasses could give depth to, its a wonder how this show stays on the air."[30]Brenda Hampton does not mind the poor reviews, saying, "I'd rather get good ratings and bad reviews than bad ratings and good reviews.".[27] Despite its lackluster critical reviews,[31] Secret Life received the highest premiere viewership ratings ever for an ABC Family original program. The pilot episode brought in 2.82 million viewers and a 0.9/3 share in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Secret Life also scored high in the female demographic, registering a 6.5/24 among female teenagers and a 3.1/11 among 12- to 34-year-old females.[32]Secret Life's mid-season finale episode of season one defeated the first hour of the much-publicized series premiere of 90210 on The CW in viewers 1234 and females 1234, beating 90210 in total viewers and all their key demographics, and bringing in some of the best ratings of the season for Secret Life.[33][34] The season one finale brought in 4.50 million viewers and was the highest rated telecast on March 23, 2009 in viewers aged 1234 and the number one scripted telecast that night. The episode also beat 90210, which had 2.20 million viewers, more than half the usual number.[10]On Monday, June 22, 2009, Secret Life opened its second season with the largest audience so far, posting a series high in total viewers with 4.68 million viewers, and second-best numbers ever in adults 1834 with 1.4 million viewers, behind season one's mid-season finale, adults 1849 with 2.1 million viewers and viewers 1234 with 2.9 million viewers. In June 2009, Secret Life ranked as cables number one scripted telecast in females 1234, and the number one scripted series telecast in viewers 1234 and female teens. Additionally, Secret Life stood as ad-supported cables number one telecast this month in female teens. The season debut became cables number one scripted series premiere of the 2008/2009 season to date in women 1834, women 1849, and viewers 1234, and the number one scripted original premiere of summer 2009 in adults 1834.[35]Secret Lifes second season debut stands as cables number one scripted original series season premiere of summer 2009 in adults ages 1834 and across core female 1834, 1849 and 1234 demos, ahead of such high profile series as USAs Royal Pains and Burn Notice, and TNTs The Closer.[36] Some critics praised the new developments of the show's second season, saying they could be "interesting material to build on." Jean Bently of EW Popwatch says that now that the whole "teen going through a pregnancy" plot has played out and the "frustrated young mother" thing is going on, we have room to explore some other topics. She remained hopeful that the writers will not just turn these new problems into issues of the week, instead allowing time for the characters to grieve Marshall's death, deal with Ann's accidental pregnancy, and explore the more emotionally complex aspects of teenage sex.[9]With more than 4.55 million people watching the season two mid-season premiere, the episode became ABC Familys most-watched telecast ever in the key 1234 and teen demos.[37] The episode stands as the series second-most-watched episode in viewers and is TVs number one telecast of the season in female teens, cables number one telecast in females 1234, and cables number one scripted telecast in viewers 1234.

This is the same attitude that Adrian had when she threw Amy a shower (Grace actually threw the shower). Adrian was so cruel that she had sex with her stepbrother during Amy's baby shower.

Grace and Jack resume their rocky relationship and have sex for the first time. After having sex, Grace learns of her father's death in a plane crash and feels guilty that the crash happened while she was having sex with Jack, and wonders if, in some way, her father's death was punishment for having sex outside of marriage. She takes a while to recover from this idea and then tries to compensate for her feelings by pledging to wait to have sex again until marriage, even organizing a group of kids to embrace abstinence. She is somewhat interested in Ben, who shows up on her doorstep occasionally, usually when he's worried about Amy and then, later, Adrian. However, after Ben begins to take responsibility for Adrian's pregnancy, she then begins to date Grant. The two of them are interested in taking their relationship to the "next level," but Grace's mother extracts a promise from Grant that he would not have sex with Grace at med camp, much to Grace's chagrin.

He goes on to explain that Grace has been with Jack after Jack had oral sex with Adrian. Adrian has been with Ricky and both Ricky and Adrian have been around with a bunch of other people. Grace then tells him he should get tested also but, he tells her the truth (about him and his ex girlfriend losing their virginity to each other) then Jack walks in and tells Grace that it would not be a bad idea to get tested because he has come into contact with an STD (that was treatable) before they had sex. This scares Grace who already does not want to do the test and she tells Grant that they should not have sex anymore. Grant then skips school the next day and goes to look for her and tells her that if she is not ready to have sex then they can wait until she is because he loves her (he wanted to tell her that he loved her before they did anything so that she would really see that he was in love with her).

The series was created and largely written by Doug Ellin and chronicles the acting career of Vincent Chase, a young A-list movie star, and his childhood friends from Queens, New York City, as they navigate the unfamiliar terrain of Los Angeles, California.Mark Wahlberg and Stephen Levinson served as the show's executive producers, and its premise is loosely based on Wahlberg's experiences as an up-and-coming film star.[1][2] The series deals with themes of male friendship and real-life situations in modern-day Hollywood. The show is known for its array of guest stars, usually featuring at least two celebrities per episode.According to Mark Wahlberg, Entourage was initially conceived when his assistant asked if he could film Wahlberg and his friends, calling them "hilarious."[3] Other reports credit Eric Weinstein, a long-time friend of Wahlberg's, with the idea of filming the actor's group of friends.[4][5] In order to be more satirical of the Hollywood lifestyle, a fictional approach was chosen rather than a straight documentary in order to keep the content light, and avoid directly depicting Wahlberg's violent past.[4]Vincent Chase was envisioned to be more similar to Wahlberg, but it was decided that some of his and his friends' activities (particularly some elements of their criminal past) would not work well on television.[3] A lighter approach was subsequently decided upon.[3]However, according to Donnie Carroll, who was the inspiration for the Turtle character, the idea for a show involving an actor and his friends had come from him.[6] It had originated as a book idea, centered on Carroll's own life and his experiences with Wahlberg, titled From the 'Hood to Hollywood, A Soldier's Story.[6]Entourage revolves around Vincent Chase (Adrian Grenier).[7][8] His best friend and manager is Eric Murphy (Kevin Connolly).[9] "E," as his friends call him, is based on Mark Wahlberg's friend and executive producer Eric Weinstein.[6] He's also been reported to be inspired by Stephen Levinson, Mark Wahlberg's manager.[4]Vincent's older half-brother, Johnny "Drama" Chase (Kevin Dillon), is Vince's personal chef, trainer and bodyguard. Johnny is a C-list actor who was in the fictional show Viking Quest during his younger days. His role in the new fictional hit show Five Towns had begun to resurrect his fame and career, although he still received less acknowledgment than he would have liked for it. As the show went on, Drama got offers for more and more roles. The show ended with Drama having his own animated TV show called "Johnny's Bananas" and him landing a new TV movie with the help of Vince. Drama's character is based on Johnny "Drama" Alves (cousin of Mark Wahlberg), whom Donnie Wahlberg had hired to keep his younger brother out of trouble.[2][6][7]Rounding out the entourage of friends is Salvatore "Turtle" Assante (Jerry Ferrara), who is another of Vince's old friends from childhood. Turtle's official role is as Vince's driver and assistant, though his value as such is often brought into question. This character is based on Mark Wahlberg's former "gofer" Donnie Carroll aka "Donkey."[2][6][7][10] Carroll auditioned for the role, but the Boston native was turned down when it was decided the actors would have to be New Yorkers.[6] Carroll died on December 18, 2005, after an asthma attack.[10]Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven) is Vince's abrasive but lovable agent. The role has led to several nominations and Emmy Awards for Piven. Ari is based on Wahlberg's real-life agent Ari Emanuel.[5][6][9]Kevin Connolly, Adrian Grenier, Kevin Dillon, Jerry Ferrara, and Jeremy Piven are credited in every episode in the opening credits of the entire series. Debi Mazar, who had a recurring guest star role as Shauna in season 1, began to receive opening credits billing in season 2. Her appearances in season 3 were limited due to her pregnancy and Mazar made her final regular appearance in episode 42 (season 3 finale). Mazar has made appearances in seasons 4 through 8 and is credited as a special guest star. Melissa Gold (Perrey Reeves) and Lloyd (Rex Lee) had recurring roles in the first two seasons. Starting in season 3, Reeves and Lee were credited as "starring" in the end credits in the episodes that they appeared in. After Debi Mazar left on maternity leave, Reeves replaced Mazar in the opening credits starting with season 4. Rex Lee was added to the opening credits starting with season 5. In season 4, Rhys Coiro's recurring character Billy Walsh was given a bigger role in the storyline, and Coiro was credited as "starring" in the first six episodes of the season. However, when his character returned in episode 52 (season 5, episode 10), he was again credited as a guest star; he returned in season 7 as a recurring special guest star and is credited as "starring" in the end credits again with season 8. Gary Cole guest starred in three episodes of season 5 as agent Andrew Klein, beginning with season 6 he was credited as "starring" in the end credits and returned in season 7 as a special guest star. Emmanuelle Chriqui has portrayed E's on-again, off-again girlfriend Sloan McQuewick (daughter of Malcolm McDowell's character Terrance McQuewick) as a recurring guest star from season 2 to 5, and beginning with season 6 she was credited as "starring" in the end credits. Scott Caan guest starred in two episodes of season 6 as Scott Lavin, and beginning with season 7 he was credited as "starring" in the end credits.Entourage features many recurring characters. Some are fictional, such as Malcolm McDowell's "Terrance McQuewick" character, while other actors, such as Bob Saget, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Mandy Moore, Sasha Grey, and Seth Green, appear as fictional versions of themselves.Entourage typically has at least one celebrity guest per episode, such as actors, film directors, film producers, musicians and professional athletes playing themselves. Appearances include Ali Larter, Peter Jackson, Christina Aguilera, Mark Wahlberg, Kanye West, Tom Brady, Chuck Liddell, Jessica Alba, Gary Busey, Larry David, Scarlett Johansson, James Cameron, Dennis Hopper, Martin Scorsese, Matt Damon, Eminem, LeBron James, Mark Cuban, John Cleese, and many others.The first season chronicles Vincent Chase's adventures as he climbs the celebrity ladder after his first successful film: Head On. At the forefront of the first few episodes is the conflict between Vince's best friend "E" and his agent Ari, who are both working to get the best for Vince, but often differ on how to accomplish this.Vince's next project is decided halfway through the season: Queens Boulevard. Signed on is indie director Billy Walsh (Rhys Coiro), who comes into immediate conflict with E. Eventually their differences are put aside and the season ends with the crew leaving for New York to start production on Queens Boulevard, with E having become Vinces official manager (with salary).Running subplots include: Turtle's laziness and quest for marijuana; Drama's struggle to follow in his younger brother's footsteps; E dating Ari's assistant Emily (Samaire Armstrong); and Vince's many and varied girlfriends.The second season focuses on Vince's proposed role in the film adaptation of Aquaman as the eponymous hero. Ari's inability to close the contract leads to trouble, but Vince manages to convince the film's director, James Cameron, that he is right for the part. However, new problems arise when the role of the leading lady goes to Mandy Moore, Vince's ex-girlfriend, for whom he still has feelings, but who is engaged to be married. Mandy and Vince resume their romance after Mandy's engagement shows signs of problems, but she eventually returns to her boyfriend. Initially devastated, Vince finds the will to go on with the film in the end.However, Ari has his own problems in the form of his boss and partner, Terrance McQuewick (Malcolm McDowell), who is trying to steal Vince away from him. Near the end of the season, their conflict reaches a head and Ari is fired from the agency after another agent, Adam Davies, leaked information suggesting that Ari may be plotting against Terrance. E, meanwhile, begins dating Sloan (Emmanuelle Chriqui), McQuewick's daughter.Meanwhile, Drama continues to try to become a star, even considering getting his calves augmented. He is eventually dropped by his agent, Adam Davies, after Vince decides to stick with Ari after Ari is fired. Turtle starts a career of his own, as manager of rapper Saigon.The third season continues with the Aquaman plotline as the film premieres and becomes a huge hit, attaining the highest-grossing opening weekend in movie history. Problems arise, however, when Medellin, Vince's dream project about the life of Pablo Escobar, conflicts with the schedule of Aquaman 2. The end result is that Vince is unable to star in either and is fired by Warner Bros.E's relationship with Sloan comes into question when he has a threesome with her and her friend Tori (Malin kerman), to whom E is attracted. Tensions rise further when E is confronted by Sloan's stalker Seth Green.Near the end of the season, Drama finally lands his big break as he's signed on to the new TV series Five Towns. Turtle's career as a music manager ends unceremoniously when he is forcefully bought out by Saigon's original manager. Ari meanwhile has to juggle his new, initially failing, business with keeping Vince happy. Even though Ari manages to set up a successful new agency with the help of Barbara Miller (Beverly D'Angelo), it leads him to neglect his star client. In the season finale, he is fired as Vince's agent after his abrasive methods result in failure to secure a film about punk band The Ramones.The second part of the third season focuses almost entirely on Vince and Ari and the troubles surrounding Medellin. Attempting to get Vince back, Ari convinces him that he can secure the film after all. Vince's new agent, Amanda (Carla Gugino), tries to steer Vince towards a different film, but he ends up refusing. To compound their problems, Vince and Amanda both admit to a mutual attraction, and have a relationship. When Medellin once again slips Vince's grasp, he questions Amanda's motives. After proving her innocence, she drops him as both client and boyfriend. With the help of Ari, who is once again hired, Vince and E finally secure their dream project when they buy the rights to the film Medellin themselves. Billy Walsh is signed on as the director with E given his first shot at producer.In the continuation of the previous part's subplot, Drama's star rises, and Five Towns becomes a hit. E moves in with Sloan.The fourth season continues the Medellin plotline as production of the film finally begins. Conflicts quickly arise when E admits to being dissatisfied with the first cut after Walsh reluctantly agrees to a midnight screening. Vince and E subsequently clash over the creative direction and financing of the film in an arc which escalates through the season. There is much contention over the ending of the script, and Stephen Gaghan is brought in briefly, at which point Walsh comes up with what he believes to be a good ending.When the Medellin trailer leaks to the public via YouTube, an opportunity is presented to leverage the resultant hype to broker a deal attaching Vince to a new big-budget project.

Series creator Doug Ellin stated, "Entourage works because it's about male friendship. The Hollywood setting is entertaining but it's really about the relationship between these guys".[16] He later added that, "Ultimately, the show's theme is friendship and family. The characters may have the bling, but they're grounded guys who look out for each other. That's the backbone of the show. If it was just about fantasy lifestyles, it wouldn't be relatable".[16][17]This view was supported by Jeremy Piven, who plays the talent agent, Ari: "If it was just a show about wish fulfillment and guys getting (sex) because their best friend was famous, it wouldn't be that interesting."[17]To strengthen the bond between the actors, only actors with ties to New York were chosen.[6][16][17]Episodes of Entourage focus, besides the friendship between the four main characters, on their lifestyle in Hollywood. Specifically, the various parties and film premieres they visit, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of being, or being connected to, a star on a person's social status. To lend credence to the show's situations and locations, most episodes of Entourage feature at least one celebrity guest star, appearing as him or herself.Entourage has generally received favorable reviews from critics, scoring 73/100 for season 3,[18] 71/100 for season 5[19] and 61/100 for season 7[20] and season 8[21] on the review aggregator site Metacritic. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, called season 3 "Almost preposterously enjoyable."[18] In 2009, Tucker remarked regarding the sixth season premiere, that "the show really isnt that funny anymore".[22] The Wall Street Journal commented on the writing, saying it "is almost always smart, sharp and funny."[18] Season 7, while still gaining generally favorable reviews, had a much more mixed reception than the earlier seasons because "it all feels maybe a little too familiar."[20]The series has been nominated for 25 Primetime Emmy Awards, in categories such as acting, directing, writing and for Outstanding Comedy Series. Jeremy Piven was nominated four consecutive times for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, winning the award three times in a row in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Kevin Dillon received three consecutive nominations in 2007, 2008, and 2009, for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.

In some countries nudity and/or profanity is edited out. The series was syndicated on local stations and WGN America,[24] but was removed from both outlets due to low ratings.[25] The series was also syndicated on Spike TV in an attempt to improve their late night ratings.[26]Kevin Dillon and Jerry Ferrara appeared as their Entourage personalities in a set of commercials for the video game Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. In the commercials, the guys are valets during the day, and racers (Turtle) and interceptors (Drama) at night.[27]Nike SB collaborated with creator Doug Ellin to commemorate the final season with an Entourage branded version of their Nike SB shoes, which will be featured on the series. However, these shoes are only exclusive for the families of the cast and crew.[28]Entourage at TV.com1 Development2 Cast and characters

The show is set in the fictional town of Tree Hill in North Carolina and originally follows the lives of two half-brothers, Lucas Scott (Chad Michael Murray) and Nathan Scott (James Lafferty), who compete for positions on their school's basketball team. Their relationship evolves from heartless enemies to caring brothers as the show progresses, and the drama that ensues from the brothers' romances with female characters and from the basketball atmosphere are significant elements within the series.The first four seasons of the show focus on the main characters' lives through their high school years. With the beginning of the fifth season, Schwahn advanced the timeline by four years to show their lives after college, and he made it jump a further fourteen months from the end of the sixth to the start of the seventh season.[2] The opening credits were originally accompanied by the song "I Don't Want to Be" by Gavin DeGraw. The theme was removed from the opening in the fifth season; Schwahn said that this was to lower production costs, to add more time for the storyline, and because he felt that the song was more representative of the core characters' adolescent past than their present maturity.[3] The credits then consisted only of the title written on a black background. The theme was restored for season 8, in response to audience demand, and was sung by different artists each week.The series premiered to 2.5 million viewers and rose to 3.3 million in its second week, becoming one of only three shows to rise in their second episode during the 20032004 television season. Season one went on to average 3.5 million viewers, and the second season was the highest rated in the series, averaging 4.3 million viewers weekly and a 1.9 Adults 1849 rating.[4] The series received numerous award nominations, winning two Teen Choice Awards.On May 12, 2009, it was confirmed that Murray and Hilarie Burton had declined to return for the seventh season, although accounts of what transpired vary.

Basketball and literature being his greatest passions, Lucas tries to find a balance between basketball, his hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and his love life. Season 6 was Murray's last season on contract as Lucas, but he returned in season 9 for one episode. Murray was first offered the lead role of Ryan Atwood on The O.C., which began seven weeks before One Tree Hill but ended in February 2007.James Lafferty portrays Nathan Scott, When Murray declined to portray Nathan, Schwahn chose Lafferty, partly because of his skill at basketball.[14] Nathan is an enemy to Lucas in season 1, but bonds with him in later episodes. He uses Haley to get revenge against Lucas, but not long after emancipating himself, he marries her out of love. Like his father and Lucas, Nathan loves basketball and dreams of playing in college. However, his dream is complicated, as his career on the court becomes entangled with supporting his family.Hilarie Burton portrays Peyton Sawyer, whose two greatest passions in life are music and art; she uses her art to express the issues that play out in her life. After Burton auditioned unsuccessfully for the part of Ed Harris's daughter in the film Radio, the casting department remembered her and asked her to audition for One Tree Hill.[15] Schwahn said, "[Burton] is an old soul. She's great. She's always just thrilled to do the job, even though she's kind of new to acting. She's just a joy to be around."[16] Peyton's best friend is Brooke Davis, and she is close friends with Haley as well. In season 1, Peyton is a cheerleader and dates Nathan, the most popular basketball star in Tree Hill High. She becomes attracted to Lucas after meeting him and soon falls in love with him. Throughout the series, Peyton is met with one tragedy after another. She is deeply in love with Lucas, who always supports her, whether things are good or bad. Season 6 was Burton's last season as Peyton.Bethany Joy Lenz portrays Haley James Scott, the quintessential girl-next-door who is best friends with Lucas Scott. Galeotti immediately identified with the character, saying, "This is me in high school." Schwahn added, "We looked for a girl who could be a sort of an everywoman, but also be unique and talented. Haley is someone who sees the world with a little skewed perspective at a time in high school when fitting in, adhering to the company line, gets you through. [Galeotti] has a point of view that isnt necessarily career-based and I wanted those qualities for Haley."[17] The pilot episode reveals that Haley grew up in a large family, but often spent her time with Lucas and Karen because she felt that they needed her more. Working as a waitress at Karen's Caf and as a tutor at Tree Hill High presents her with opportunities, as well as obstacles. She finds herself in a predicament when Lucas's half-brother Nathan asks her to tutor him. Risking her relationship with Lucas, Haley agrees, but on the condition that her best friend is no longer tormented by Nathan and his friends. This arrangement changes the Scott family dynamic forever and allows a romance between Nathan and Haley to flourish. They experience many ups and downs together throughout the series and find themselves having to deal with the consequences of each others' actions.Sophia Bush portrays Brooke Davis. "What I do like about her the things that I have had to portray her going through you always learn a lesson from Brooke", stated Bush. "She always manages to pick herself up when she falls on her face. And I respect that. She is not all high and mighty and she doesn't act like she is always right. She has a lot of convictions and she is [a] really loyal friend. I appreciate how loyal she is. She doesn't take betrayal lightly and she doesn't think it is OK to lie to someone."[18] Brooke is the beautiful captain of the high school cheerleading squad, and a friend of Peyton and Haley. She has twice been a girlfriend to Lucas. Though her life appears perfect at the beginning, she is seen to suffer from having to deal with her distant parents. Her friends' inability to take her seriously and the betrayal of Lucas and Peyton when they date behind her back leave her hurt. She eventually overcomes the betrayal and is determined to live a full, happy life.Paul Johansson portrays Dan Scott, Lucas and Nathan's father and the primary antagonist for the early seasons. "The most interesting characters you see on most shows, don't you think, are the ones that have a mixture? There's no such thing as pure evil. There's no such thing as pure good," said Johansson. "I love this character. [Schwahn] has come up with something that is a mixture between my father, his father, and The Great Santini."[19] His evil side comes to the forefront when his marriage to Deb crumbles. Dan experiences rivalry with his brother throughout the early seasons. His relationships with Karen and Deb are also major storylines in the series, and he tries to make amends for his wrongdoings despite his occasional impulse not to. He dies in the hospital in the ninth season after being shot saving Nathan from European assassins.Barry Corbin portrays Brian "Whitey" Durham, the Ravens' coach for over 35 years, who retires in season 4. Schwahn said, "Whitey was often good counsel to Lucas and his world, but when we jumped the show ahead, it was time for Lucas and his world to find their own way."[20] Over the course of the series, the show emphasizes how Whitey and Dan never saw eye-to-eye and often bickered over differences of opinion when Dan was one of Whitey's players. Whitey often laments the death of his wife Camilla and the fact that he did not spend more time with her while she was alive. He retires after the Ravens win the much-coveted NC State Championship title for him, but later takes a coaching position in a college near Tree Hill, giving Nathan the chance to play college basketball. Whitey makes an appearance in the season 6 finale.Craig Sheffer portrays Keith Scott, Dan's older, kinder, under-achieving brother. Sheffer said that characters like Keith are not the most enjoyable to play. "Keith is a very simple character. I actually prefer more of a challenge. He wasn't a hugely interesting character. But he was a good guy and he was just a really genuine human being with good intentions", commented Sheffer. "And thats a nice thing to play and come home at the end of the day. You dont bring too much with you. We had some good scenes within the framework of a simple character, so there was some of that stuff to play, but also a lot of cheesy stuff."[21] After Dan chose Deb rather than Karen, Keith helped Karen to raise Lucas and fell in love with her, but they only get together in season three. He had a recurring drinking problem and rivalry with his brother. Towards the end of the season, Dan kills Keith, believing that Keith had attempted to murder him in the dealership fire. After Keith's death, Karen gives birth to their daughter, Lily Roe-Scott. Keith haunts Dan as a teen and as an adult ghost, but later forgives him. He guides his nephews Lucas and Nathan like a guardian angel throughout season 4. He returns again as an angel in the ninth season, to take Dan away who just died.Moira Kelly portrays Karen Roe, Lucas's mother. Kelly said, "as long as they keep Karen [as] the words of wisdom, the kind of sane one, the one who is trying to make her son understand what it is that they're really going through at this age, you know, that she keeps it together, then I'm happy because it's nice to be the voice of reason. It's better for me, personally, to have that kind of role, especially on that kind of show that's geared towards teenagers. There's got to be, I feel, a role model that says, 'Okay look, it seems this way right now, but it may very well be this way later.'"[22] Dan abandoned Karen after she became pregnant in high school. With help from Dan's brother Keith, who in later years is her lover and father of her second child, Karen raises Lucas to strive for his best potential. She is devastated by Keith's death in season 3. In season 4 she becomes close to Dan again, until she learns that he killed Keith. In season 5 Karen travels the world with Lily. When she returns for Lucas's wedding, she is accompanied by Andy Hargrove. Karen also makes an appearance at the end of season 6.Barbara Alyn Woods portrays Deb Scott, Dan's wife and Nathan's mother. Initially normal, she later becomes neurotic. Woods said, "She's fun to play, I love Deb Scott, she's a well-rounded character. I can't say I'm a lot like her, but I think our desires are the same. I think we want to be career women and good moms I hope I'm a bit more successful than she is." Explaining their differences, Woods added, "I've never done any drugs in my whole life, I've never even smoked a cigarette that's where I'd start lay off the drugs. I'm not a big drinker, so I'd lay off the booze. So, that would be a good start for a mom I would say. And I've never cheated on my husband."[23] Seventeen years of marriage to Dan have made Deb bitter, and she divorces him in season 3, her hatred of him once driving her to try to kill him. Deb battles a addiction to pills in season 2 and again in season 4, but overcomes it permanently the second time. She makes a return in season 5 to help Nathan and Haley with the babysitting of their child. Woods reprised the role in the final season.Lee Norris portrays Marvin "Mouth" McFadden, one of Lucas's oldest friends they were both members of a group of children who played together at the Rivercourt, an outdoor basketball court in Tree Hill. Schwahn spoke of seeing himself in Mouth.[24] Norris said that during the spring break in his junior year at school, when the pilot for One Tree Hill came up, he drove alone to the casting director and Mark Schwahn. "[A basketball announcer] was easy for me to play because I was this big college basketball fan, and I even wore my college team t-shirt to the audition," said Norris, adding that "at the end of the day, I think Mouth always remains a good guy in his heart and its absolutely good to play that, because you feel good when you have a character like that on TV. Even if he doesnt always do the right thing, you know its coming from a good place."[25] Mouth is unlucky in love: he has an unrequited love for Brooke in season 2; Erica dumps him when she becomes popular; and he falls for Rachel only to see the older Cooper preferred over him. GiGi, his fellow sports announcer, also breaks up with him, and Shelly Simon leaves him after he loses his virginity to her. In season 5, he has an affair with his boss Alice, before finally settling down with Millicent.Antwon Tanner portrays Antwon "Skills" Taylor, one of Lucas' oldest friends and another of those who played at the Rivercourt as children. Tanner said that at first he had thought Skills would become an important character, but later had come to doubt it. "My character was originally on the thing as recurring, possible series regular, and I was told that once we got picked up my character would become a series regular", he said. "Then when I didn't and the show went in a different direction, I was kind of like, 'Uh-oh.' I didn't think the fans took to him at first, so I thought maybe that's why the studio did it like that. But now he's doing his thing, so I ain't mad at it. They need to write me in more!"[26] Skills takes on a more prominent role in season 4, when he fills Lucas's vacancy in the Ravens. In season 5, he becomes the assistant head coach of the Ravens basketball team and lives with Mouth, Junk and Fergie.Danneel Harris portrays Rachel Gatina, who moves to Tree Hill in season 3. Harris said, "Rachel is a dynamic character who is known for changing her opinions, personalities, friends, and locations. I feel like each time she returns to Tree Hill from one of her many adventures, she is a bit different... ...Rachel is such a fun character to play, so the intrigue is more of...'What will she do next?'"[27] After joining the cheerleading squad, Rachel clashes with Brooke over Lucas, but the two become friends later on. In season 5, Rachel is a former employee of Brooke, and a heroin addict who takes an overdose after being fired by her friend. Brooke brings Rachel back to Tree Hill to help get her life back on track, but Rachel leaves again, taking a large amount of Brooke's cash with her. In the seventh season, Rachel returns as Dan Scott's new wife.Jackson Brundage portrays Jamie Scott, the highly-intelligent eight-year-old son of Nathan and Haley. "Jackson Brundage is a rock star. He's such a great kid and we all feel blessed to have him in our lives," said Schwahn. "Some credit for his performances has to go to his parents, especially his [mother] who works with him on his preparation and understanding of the more complex material, but Jackson is very gifted and very sweet. And the cast is at their best around him."[20] Jamie sees Nathan as a role-model and is first introduced in the fifth season.Lisa Goldstein portrays Millicent Huxtable, Brooke's assistant at her shop Clothes Over Bro's. "I was constantly auditioning for TV and film while performing in professional theatre", said Goldstein. "My agent in Orlando called and told me there was an audition for One Tree Hill, and told me I could either audition for the receptionist or the quirky fashion assistant, 'Millicent.' I jumped at the chance to audition for the 'quirky assistant,' I thought it would be fun." She added, "[Millicent] found someone to love her quirks and all, which made her perfectly OK with being exactly who she is."[28] Millicent is involved in a romantic relationship with Marvin "Mouth" McFadden. In the first episode of season 6 she moves to Omaha with him. She returns to Tree Hill during the fifth episode to work for Brooke in her new store. She reunites with Mouth only to endure a series of mishaps.Austin Nichols portrays Julian Baker, Peyton's ex-boyfriend from Los Angeles. "The funny thing about Austin is that there was initially much resistance from the folks who have to OK our casting choices. Which is not rare, by the way," commented Schwahn. "When that happens, I pick up the phone and try to rationalize with everyone, or pout or bitch or whine and eventually I get my way (and probably get called an ass****) and this leads to Austin Nichols killing it as Julian, just as I suspected he would in the first place." Schwahn added, "This is not to say that there aren't good people and good allies working on my show at both the studio and network, just that the fans would be surprised at how things work behind the scenes."[20] A regular from season 7, Julian initially comes to Tree Hill to win Peyton back. He offers to produce a film based on Lucas's first book. At first Peyton does not reveal to Lucas that Julian is her ex-boyfriend, but she is forced to do so when the plans of the movie take shape. Brooke rebuffs his advances until Peyton gives her blessing when she sees that Brooke has a serious interest in Julian. After Brooke opens up to Julian, they begin a relationship.Robert Buckley portrays Clay Evans, Nathan's sports agent from season 7 onwards. Buckley described Clay as part bad boy, part good guy, a man who plays the field when it comes to relationships, but who is extremely dedicated to his job, clients and friends. "He gets around, he's very popular with the females," said Buckley. "But at his core he's a very great friend to Nathan. He's a very loving and protective person."[29] The New York Post stated, "Its clear that he's the new Lucas in terms of stepping in and being Nathan's buddy, but, even after the first two episodes, viewers can tell theres more purpose to Clay than just being a sidekick."[30] Clay is initially shown as a flirt, but the back story reveals that he has adopted this persona to cope with his wife's death. Clay is romantically involved with Quinn James.Shantel VanSanten portrays Quinn James, Haley's free spirited older sister. Fans were unreceptive to the character at first, but eventually warmed to her. "Its funny. I feel that. I struggle because I take it personally. Obviously, it is a personal thing. Quinn is a character that the writers and myself have developed", said VanSanten. "And there was no way that I could ever change the way that we started last season where I came into the picture all of a sudden, crying all the time. It was a really emotional thing and it wasnt something that we could really explore a whole lot of. So, I think it was a hard place for people to accept as I came in. I wasnt bubbly and happy. You know?"[31] Quinn is introduced in season 7 when she moves back to Tree Hill after her marriage breaks down.Jana Kramer portrays Alex Dupre[32] (Alice Whitehead), an actress turned model who moved to Tree Hill to become the new face of Brooke's fashion line. Later she makes sexual advances towards Julian, Brooke's boyfriend. Alex started out as a recurring character, but was upgraded to series regular status in the second half of season 7.Stephen Colletti portrays Chase Adams, a "clean-teen" introduced in season 4 as a potential love interest for Brooke. He had a recurring role until the later half of season 8, when he was upgraded to series regular status.[33] In season 8 Chase becomes involved in a love triangle with actress Alex and musician Mia. He also becomes a Big Brother for Jamie's classmate, Chuck Scolnik. In season 9, he develops a friendship with Chris Keller.Tyler Hilton portrays Chris Keller. The character makes his debut in season 2 as an an arrogant, selfish man who constantly refers to himself in the third person. He connects with Haley through her music and succeeds in breaking her relationship with Nathan. Chris returned for minor appearances in seasons 3 and 4, and again returned as a series regular for season 9, as Mark Schwahn had wanted him to return since the time jump into season 5.[34] In season 9, Chris Keller manages Red Bedroom Records.Schwahn originally planned to make One Tree Hill a feature length film with the title Ravens, the name of the show's high school basketball team. However, he became convinced that it would be more interesting as a television series.[35] He said the idea for the story came from his own personal experiences. As in the setting of the show, Schwahn went to school in a small town and played on a basketball team. He described himself as similar to the character of Mouth McFadden. Schwahn said that in designing the show, he created Lucas as "this underdog kid from the wrong side of the tracks" who crosses over to the pretty and popular; he wanted to show the life of such a person in a basketball context, feeling that basketball was a great platform for telling stories.[24]The title of the show and the name of the fictional town where the series takes place are derived from the song "One Tree Hill", which is named after the landmark in New Zealand. Most of the show's episodes are titles of songs, bands or albums.[36] Schwahn named the town "Tree Hill" because, while he was writing the idea for the show, he had been listening to the album The Joshua Tree by U2.[35] In the early days, fans often asked Schwahn why the show was named One Tree Hill when the town was just called Tree Hill. The question is ostensibly answered when Karen tells Lucas in episode 1.22, "There is only one Tree Hill... and it's your home."[37] The same sentence was said by Haley to Jamie on the roof of Karen's Cafe in episode 9.13, the series finale.[38]One Tree Hill consists of various themes, such as love, friendship, rivalries and betrayal, and explores the reasons behind them.[39][40] Neal Solon of DVD Verdict explained, "Much of the show is based on the mistakes the teens' parents have made and the way these mistakes manifest themselves in the students' lives."[39] Two of the show's most prominent themes have been basketball and romance.Basketball is a core aspect of the show,[42] helping to create an atmosphere of masculinity and attract male viewers.[43][44][45] TheCinemaSource.com said of the show's early seasons, "The only thing you might notice that's strange is that the teens' school lives are heavily focused on basketball and cheerleading. If they do happen to be in a classroom, the only teacher they have is Coach Whitey."[46]Schwahn stated of the basketball element, "A lot of times, the basketball games for us are like the crimes, or it's the courtroom, the police precinct, or the medical operating arena  it was like our home turf." He said the other shows rarely focus on the court case or medical problem being dealt with, but are more about the people. "For us, that's what basketball was. It was never about playing basketball, but it was about what was happening to the people when this game or tournament was approaching."[42]In season 2, the basketball drama was completely removed from the series, as executives felt that the show was geared more toward a male audience.[47] David Janollari, then entertainment president at The WB, attributed the shows sophomore success partly to its shift in focus from a male-driven sports plot to expanding the stories of its girls. He felt they had time to "step back and learn from audience response" and that Schwahn tailored the show toward the "core audience". Schwahn said, "Girls watch the show in large numbers. [In the first season], the girls were sort of appendages to the boys." Show producer Joe Davola and Schwahn agreed with the "sex sells" and "skin to win" sentiments. Less time on the basketball court could afford One Tree Hill more time for plots fueled by sex and drugs.[47] Lack of basketball drama, however, meant a decrease in male viewership. In a 2006 interview, Schwahn said, "In the second TV season, we didn't play any basketball, which was the rest of their junior year, and I felt that the show suffered a little bit."[42]Schwahn made Lucas and Peyton's love affair a central theme of the show, saying he "designed a world where Peyton and Lucas were meant to be together"[49] and that "the seeds were planted for [Lucas] to pick Peyton in the pilot in [that] first episode... When Lucas is at the Rivercourt at the end of that pilot, you know. I think we feel like this is the girl [who] is his soulmate. And, you know, the pilot ends with him saying, 'I'll be seeing you.'"[50]Lucas and Peyton have been referred to as star-crossed.[51][52] Schwahn described the theme of their relationship as "two kids that carry around the weight of the world quite a bit. Can they agree together to let go of that weight? The theme for Lucas and Peyton is, 'How do you learn to be happy when you've spent so much time carrying grief around? Do you feel guilty for being happy? Is it OK to let it go?'"[53] The couple was also given theme music to enhance the scenes where Lucas rescues Peyton (from despair, dangerous situations, or herself). The theme, titled "Saving Peyton", was composed by John Nordstrom and first heard in the school shooting episode "With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept", in which Lucas strives to save a dying Peyton.[54]Making Lucas and Peyton the central love story created an intense rivalry between their fans and those who would prefer him to be with or end up with Brooke. "[These] are two very passionate camps. And don't think I don't know it," acknowledged Schwahn. "I think sometimes one camp thinks they're being ignored." Schwahn said that although he designed Lucas and Peyton to be together from the start, this did not preclude Brooke and Lucas ending up together, and that he was aware of the "great chemistry" between their portrayers, real-life ex-spouses Murray and Bush. He was not stubbornly holding on to the idea of [Lucas and Peyton].[55] Schwahn said the Peyton-Lucas-Brooke love triangle is also by design and became a staple of the show.[3] "There is a huge fanbase dedicated to Brooke and Lucas, and sometimes [those people] feel a bit betrayed, just as the fanbase dedicated to Peyton and Lucas felt betrayed [in season 2 and parts of season 3]", said Schwahn. "That tells me that we've done things correctly that's the strength of a love triangle."[53]The idea that fanbases could be betrayed was first expressed in the season 2 episode "Don't Take Me For Granted", in which Lucas says that a girl is "slipping away" and he needs to confess his love for her but shows up at Brooke's house instead of Peyton's. Most viewers (including Lucas-Peyton and Brooke-Lucas fans) could not relate the "slipping away" line to Brooke, since Peyton had been the girl Lucas was in love with in season 1 and had since become estranged from him. Sources cited fans as pondering four questions: When was Brooke slipping away? Did Lucas simply mean he did not want to lose her? Was it a plot device to make it seem like Peyton? Or was it Peyton? Speculation that Murray and Bush's marriage affected Lucas's sudden change of heart, including whether or not Brooke and Lucas would be together, was also rampant.[56] Schwahn stated:The show's other prominent pairing, Nathan and Haley, emerged as a supercouple. James Lafferty, Nathan's portrayer, said, "I think Nathan and Haley... Well Schwahn always says that he had that sort of as an 'ace in the hole' the entire time. As he was writing the pilot script, he was planning on doing that, he really didn't know how it would pan out or what would happen. But, the fans have responded so passionately towards it, and I'm not really sure why."[58] However, Lafferty has said that there is a genuine relationship between Nathan and Haley: "It started as something sort of based on betrayal and deceit. It then kind of transgressed over into something based on actual true love. So, I think that it's a transition that the fans really bought into, and I think that people really enjoy to watch."[58] Schwahn called the couple "gold"[59] and said, "I love Nathan and Haley, and most of our audience does as well."[53] He explained that Nathan and Haley's fan base is strong because they have always been the most stable couple on the show, admitting that it confuses him when people ask when he is going to let them be happy. "They have a lot of obstacles come their way", said Schwahn, "but I see them growing especially with the jump [the four years that elapse between seasons 4 and 5] ahead and aging them a little bit I see them growing into some really great places, not only as individuals, but as a family."[59]Music plays a significant part in the plot and the movement of the scenes throughout the show.[60] Schwahn revealed that each episode is named after a particular song, band or album that has something in common with the theme of the episode.[36] Popular indie music has been featured on the show, and various artists have guest-starred.[61]Three soundtrack albums from the show have been released: One Tree Hill  Music From The WB Television Series, Vol. 1, Friends with Benefit: Music from the Television Series One Tree Hill, Volume 2 and The Road Mix: Music from the Television Series One Tree Hill, Volume 3. A portion of the proceeds of the second soundtrack go to the National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF), tying in with a storyline on the show involving breast cancer.[62][63] On November 13, 2008, iTunes published a soundtrack called Music From One Tree Hill, which contained songs from the sixth season.[61]Episodes follow a regular structure. An episode normally begins with a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative, although this is sometimes dropped to satisfy time constraints. During the first four seasons, the theme tune is played either immediately after the recap or after the first few scenes. Whenever an episode features sensitive or violent subjects, or when an episode's running length is close to the total allotted time, there is no opening montage, but only One Tree Hill written on a black background. From the beginning of season 5, the theme song, "I Don't Want to Be" by Gavin DeGraw, was abandoned, and only the single white-on-black title was used. The theme was restored for season 8, sung by different artists each week. Schwahn's reasons for removing the theme were various:One Tree Hill is known for its numerous voice-overs featuring either literary quotes or characters reflecting on events of the episode. Most of them have been made by Chad Michael Murray's character Lucas. However, other characters have done so several times. Guest stars Bryan Greenberg, Sheryl Lee, Torrey DeVitto and Ashley Rickards have also done voice-overs for single episodes. Characters who interact with the main cast, such as Bevin, Chase, Shelly and Glenda, helped to narrate the joint episodes, being portrayed by Bevin Prince, Stephen Colletti, Elisabeth Harnois and Amber Wallace.[64] As the show progresses, songs continue to replace voiceovers occasionally. At the beginning of season 7, Paul Johansson's character, Dan Scott, has taken over the narrator's role.In 2008, a black and white episode on a Film noir theme was planned, to be written by Chad Michael Murray. Schwahn said, "I think that noir-themed is very risky, because I think that can be very dark and very guy-ish in its approach. I'd say this is more Casablanca infused."[3]One Tree Hill starts in 2003 and has an ever more complicated timeline, which varies between contrasting with and corresponding to the real world. In the first season, the main teenage characters are aged sixteen.[65] The first and second seasons cover one year, and the third and fourth seasons another,[42] so the main teenage characters are nearly eighteen at the end of the fourth season.[66] The timeline was further complicated in the fifth season, when the show was "dramatically retooled and set four years into the future after the characters [had] already graduated from college".[67][68] The fifth season began shooting on July 30, 2007, and premiered January 8, 2008.[68] In it, the characters were stated to be aged twenty-two.[69] In 2009, Schwahn altered the timeline again, setting the seventh season fourteen months after the sixth, thus giving a better explanation for the somewhat abrupt departures of series leads Chad Michael Murray and Hilarie Burton.[70]Explaining the decision to start the series with the teenagers as juniors, Schwahn said, "Lucas and Nathan were important players on the [basketball] team, the most important, and I just couldn't see that happening to freshmen." He also wanted to keep the characters in high school longer, saying, "I know a lot of the shows that we started with, the kids are out of high school now and into college and what have you, and I always thought that there was a loss of energy when that happened. It's hard to have everyone go to the same college and everyone stay together for whatever reason, or you lose some of your principles."[3] Schwahn wanted to reinvigorate the show. "The show in many ways has been refaced and reinvigorated. It's very much a twenty-something show now with some relevant adult characters, and I really like that energy for the show," he said,[3] and elaborated:Schwahn felt that altering the series in this way allowed the storylines to be a little more complex, and said the actors welcomed the change.[3] One critic said, "The fifth season of One Tree Hill completely reinvented the series... It was a risky move, but one that ultimately paid off."[3]AT&T has been a sponsor of the show. An example includes allowing fans to text whether or not Nathan should kiss Haley's sister, Taylor, in season 2, and having that be the storyline's outcome.[71] Sunkist is another sponsor; it is visible at concerts in episodes such as "When it Isn't Like it Should Be" and "Just Watch the Fireworks", in the characters' fridges, and on the school's vending machines. It held a contest to choose which town the characters would visit in "It Gets the Worst at Night", and Honey Grove, Texas won.[72]In episode 4.04, "Can't Stop This Thing We Started", Rachel takes part in a Maxim photoshoot, which mirrored a real-life photoshoot for Danneel Harris, Hilarie Burton and Sophia Bush in 2006.[73][74] In episode 4.07, "All These Things That I've Done", CariDee English, winner of a challenge on America's Next Top Model, played a small role as a model named Tia in a fashion show.[75] In episode 5.17, "Hate is Safer Than Love", Mia, played by Kate Voegele, agrees to take part in both Rock the Vote and a Starburst-funded concert.[76] In 2008, The CW, Warner Bros. and Macy's partnered to offer eight "passionate" fans the chance for a walk-on role on the show and a weekend with the cast, billed as the "Ultimate Fan Weekend in Wilmington".[77]In 2009, Chad Michael Murray and Hilarie Burton were confirmed as having declined to return to the series.[5][6][7] For months, it was speculated that they would not be returning for the seventh season. Then, in February, The CW announced a series renewal without specifying which cast members had renewed their contracts. A video of Murray, seemingly unaware he was being filmed, saying the show was not bringing him back because they wanted to save money, and encouraging fans to rally behind him, intensified speculation.[5] A video of Burton saying she would stay if she had creative control also surfaced, fueling speculation that The CW did not want to keep Burton on the show without Murray.[78] To some fans, One Tree Hill without Murray and Burton sounded "kind of like Seinfeld without Seinfeld... and Elaine". It elicited skepticism from fans who consider the heart of the show to be the dynamic between their characters, Lucas and Peyton. A TVGuide.com poll found that nearly half of respondents, however, were willing to take a "wait and see" approach to a revamped version of the series.[79] In April, Schwann told a crowd in Paris that all of the actors had signed on for season 7, except for Murray and Burton. "They're in negotiations right now and I know they've been offered great things, and hopefully they'll decide to come back", he said. "If they don't, that's always a possibility... [the show] has made it through some of the riskier moves we've done."[5] In May, CW entertainment president Dawn Ostroff stated, "We tried to get them to stay; we would have been thrilled if they wanted to." She said that since Murray and Burton were moving on, Tree Hill now had to reinvent itself a bit as it did in 2007, with the four-year flash-forward. "A show going into its seventh year is very open to reinventing itself," said Ostroff. "And one thing I have to give Mark Schwahn a lot of credit for is that he has kept the show so fresh all these years."[80]Burton told Entertainment Weekly that there was a possibility that she would return for guest appearances if asked, and clarified what happened behind the scenes regarding her contract. "... when I hear that theres turmoil or negotiations based on money, it kind of hurts my feelings, because its not whats been going on at all," she said. "I think my fan base in particular knows that money isnt necessarily a big motivator for me, thats why I work in the world of independent film."[78] She said she had known "for a little while" that she was leaving, and that she made that decision. "For me, it was definitely an emotional decision. And a professional decision as well. I got really, really lucky. One Tree Hill was my very first television audition; it was a fairytale," said Burton. "I feel really lucky to have that level of success right out of the gate." Burton further stated:Criticism of how their characters, Lucas and Peyton, were written out of the series focused mainly on a lack of explanation about where they went, and the exit not having been morbid enough for a star-crossed couple.[51][81] Although the episode featuring their departure is initially grim, the episode's tone is drastically different by the end. Fans expected a tragic ending because of Lucas and Peyton's star-crossed history and the show's penchant for shocker-finales. MTV composed tragic scenarios for how to write the couple out of the series, but concluded by saying, "OK, OK. Maybe after all they've been through in six seasons, these two deserved their happy ending. Lucas and Peyton, you were this generation's Joey and Pacey: the overly dramatic couple we couldn't help but root for. We'll miss you."[81] The exit was picked as one of the "12 most essential episodes of One Tree Hill" in 2009 by fans at starnewsonline.com.[41] Schwahn said, "I know there are a lot of fans who are going to watch to see how we explain Peyton and Lucass absence.... Theyre traveling, theyre spending time with [Lucass mother] Karen and [her husband] Andy, theyre raising their child, hes working on his book." Schwahn said he found it realistic that Lucas and Peyton would be out just living their lives. "Ive been very upfront with the studio and network in saying, 'Look, the audience may not accept a new version of the show. But weve reinvented it a few times before. I dont want to be dismissive of [Murray and Burton]. But when you see the first couple of episodes [in the new season], youre either in for this new show or not'", he said. "So every week, to talk about Lucas and Peyton actually feels like it hurts us more than it helps us. Obviously, they were a huge part of One Tree Hill. But you move forward.[51] To fill the void of Murray and Burton's departures, Robert Buckley and Shantel VanSanten were cast as Nathan's agent Clay and Haley's sister Quinn respectively. Austin Nichols, who plays Julian Baker, was also upgraded to series regular status.[5]Plans for Murray and Burton to return to the series in Season 8 were confirmed. Schwahn said that the actors' busy schedules could possibly prevent a return in time for Brooke's wedding, but he hoped they could return later in the season.[82] On December 7, 2010, Kristin Dos Santos stated that Murray and Burton would definitely not be back for Brooke's wedding, but that they were still expected to return.[83] In January 2011, Burton confirmed that she would not be returning.[84] In August 2011, The CW revealed that Murray would return for a guest appearance in the final season.[12] Burton did not return, as she was not asked back that time around.[85]The show has received mixed reviews. Critics have compared it to The O.C. and Dawson's Creek, but with a more masculine appeal,[44][45][86][87][88] and a significant number of fans have debated the relative merits of One Tree Hill versus The O.C.. Lucas and Ryan Atwood have been noted for their similarities in being brooding blond male leads in a new environment, having a wealthy nemesis and falling in love with the nemesis's popular girlfriend (Peyton/Marissa Cooper). Comparisons have also been made between Brooke and Summer Roberts for being dark-haired vixens and best friends of the popular female lead. Chad Michael Murray was originally chosen for the part of Ryan Atwood[89] and had guest-starred on Dawson's Creek as a minor character, which led to One Tree Hill referencing Dawson's Creek in the first episode.[44] "Where Dawson's was about relationships, especially between boys and girls, One Tree Hill tries to be about masculinity, especially as negotiated through sports", wrote Tracy McLoone of PopMatters,[44] who predicted that, despite this, it would probably be pinned as a girl's show. "This doesn't mean boys won't watch it, just that they won't talk about it."[44] Allison McCracken of flowtv.org, on the other hand, called it a "boy soap opera", saying, "The new boy-centered soap employs 'feminine' generic serial elements to explore male adolescence and relationships between males, often focusing around brothers or fathers & sons",[45] and, "The boy soap is as pleasurable a text for female viewers as television offers today."[45]Chris Carle of IGN said, "One Tree Hill, like The O.C. is helping to infuse network television with a much-needed renaissance of teen drama. The series is a bit less fun and more dramatic than Fox's, and the themes and storylines hold a little more gravity than The O.C.'s sometimes soap opera dynamic, but it's a solid show."[87] Keith Helinski of Moviefreak.com disagreed with The O.C. comparisons. "Ever so often I hear people refer to the show as The WBs version of The O.C., but I disagree. Summerland is more like The O.C. with similar scenarios and settings, while One Tree Hill is more suited as a Dawsons Creek knock off," he said. "In fact, story lines, characters, and even the themes are so similar that one would think One Tree Hill is like Dawsons Creek: The Next Generation."[90]The Wall Street Journal said, "The WB's One Tree Hill, a slick prime-time drama about a small town packed with hunky teenagers and simmering family secrets, is one of the fastest-growing shows on network television."[72] The Star-Ledger commented, "One Tree Hill is a welcome surprise... Every choice it makes from pacing to photography to music seems just about right, and the casting is inspired."[72] Alynda Wheat of Entertainment Weekly called the show a "guilty pleasure" and said they had not had one "this guilty" since Melrose Place. "Their relationships change so quickly you'd need a spreadsheet to keep up," she stated. "As Brooke put it to Peyton, 'I think Nathan likes Tutor Girl, but I think Tutor Girl likes Lucas. And I know I like Lucas, and I don't know who the hell you like anymore.'"[86] However, Wheat criticized the lack of parents in most of the teenage characters' lives. "Any time order threatens to reign, the writers ship out the parents  to Italy, a boating accident, whatever," said Wheat.[86] Daniel Fienberg of zap2it.com said that, though the show has all the elements that make for a good show about teenagers/young adults, "it's also a show that has stubbornly refused to be categorized merely as a guilt  [sic] pleasure and its myriad artistic pretensions  Lucas's Bartlett's Familiar Quotations-spewing narration, Peyton's (Hilarie Burton) pedantic lectures on indie rock, countless expositional monologues lifted from a Philosophy 101 lecturehave often rendered it merely bad, rather than so-bad-its-good". Fienberg did, however, compliment the school shooting episode.[91] Cynthia Boris of DVDVerdict.com, on the other hand, said, "One Tree Hill doesn't claim to be anything more than it is. They acknowledge that they're a teen fantasy complete with an appropriately emo WB soundtrack."[39]Ginia Bellefante of The New York Times criticized the show's lack of insight into the consequences of teenage pregnancy. "In the wake of the discussion surrounding Juno and the horror over Jamie Lynn Spears, the show displays an almost aggressive aversion to moralizing about teenage pregnancy", she said. "Refusing to lay out the grim consequences of premature motherhood, it seems as if it wants to make fans on either end of the political spectrum stick their heads in fiery hampers."[69] Author Emily B. Anzicek said that pregnancy seems to be the only possible physical consequence for the residents of One Tree Hill and that discussion of STDs is non-existent, criticizing the "potential threat" due to the amount of promiscuity, such as several characters having sex with people they hardly know. "Of all the episodes in the first three seasons, there are two mentions of condoms. One happens when Deb catches Brooke and Lucas at the drug store buying condoms and whipped cream", said Anzicek. "The second happens in season two when Brooke throws a wedding reception for Nathan and Haley and decorates the room with condoms blown up like balloons." Anzicek said the teenagers, who are only supposed to be sixteen and seventeen at this time, are presented as very sexually-experienced, especially Brooke, and that the one exception is Haley.[48]Ian Arbuckle of Chud.com complimented the series on its musical aspect. "Pop music is built on repetition of themes and structures. Pop television follows a similar pattern, revisiting old plots with new characters in a sort of 'Here comes the new show, same as the old show' mode", he said. "One Tree Hill is firmly couched in both the pop television and pop music traditions."[60] Chris Carle of IGN said, "Like the series itself, the offering is a little more adult (read: adult contemporary) and a little less fresh than other similar soundtracks. It's not without its standouts, but overall the selection is plucked from the lighter fare on alt rock radio."[87]Regarding the show's flexibility, Arbuckle stated, " One Tree Hill doesn't focus exclusively on the teenagers, but also stretches out to include dedicated subplots for their parents and other adults." He said there is not much of a maturity gap between the two sides. "[In]stead, to keep the structure somewhat separate, the respective focuses are on different emotions. For the teens, it's love; for the adults, it's revenge."[60] For example, one of the audience's main concerns has been "Who should Lucas end up with?"[92] "If you're a huge fan of One Tree Hill, chances are you've had a debate at some point about who Lucas Scott should ultimately settle down with," stated Don Williams of BuddyTV.com. "... these shippers can be an extremely rabid bunch. There are some fans who want Lucas with Peyton, others who'd like to see him go back to Brooke, and even a few who think that Lindsey was his perfect match."[92]The show's first season was well regarded.[39][88] "One Tree Hill: The Complete First Season is a surprisingly rewarding experience", said Neal Solon of DVD Verdict. "Throughout its first season, One Tree Hill distinguishes itself from other teen dramas by dealing with more than just the backstabbing, backbiting, and backwards morals of today's youth," he said. "Certainly, the show contains its fair share of this petty drama, but it also explores the reasons behind it." He gives the effect of the parents' mistakes on the teenagers as an example.[39] Solon felt that the Season 1 finale was strong partly because its creators did not know if the WB would renew the show. "The last few episodes bring some form of closure to the major story arcs, while leaving the door wide open for further development should the show continue. It is an artfully employed strategy that paid off," he said.[39] Also reviewing season 1, Paul Cooke of DVDActive.com stated, "If you take the time to invest some emotional capital in the lives of the characters, you usually will find yourself absorbed in their trials and tribulations. One Tree Hill is no different, in fact, it may be notch above some of the other teen angst shows." Cooke added, "All of the actors are pleasant to look at, the storylines are interesting and the music is fresh and enjoyable. How could someone not enjoy this show? Do yourself a favour, and visit One Tree Hill."[88]Though season 2 is the show's highest-rated season,[4] it is also one of its most criticized. The complaints include: the loss of basketball, confusion over which girl is Lucas's true love,[57] backstabbing and plotting with nothing to make the show unique[40] and Dan being turned into an almost cartoon-ish villain. "Dan is a jealous man, and the writers come dangerously close to making him nothing more than an evil man," said Arbuckle. Amy Kane of Film.com called the character "the most ridiculous villain never to twirl a mustache".[93] Though he called the plot-level elements satisfying, Arbuckle also criticized the dialogue, saying it begins to break down. "The series' writers never have a good grip either of the rhythms of teenage slang (including painful forays into ebonics) nor the erudite beats of businessmen," he said.[60] He credited male viewers with watching partly for the physically attractive girls.[60] In contrast, TheCinemaSource.com said of the show's third season that the dialogue is "clever and sarcastic from the last word of a scene to the very first of the next. Whoever writes Dan's witty comeback lines is hilarious".[46] One of the more complimented additions to season 2 was the character Anna Taggaro,[40][94] credited by AfterEllen.com as the first recurring bisexual character of color on television; though whether the character is "truly bisexual" or simply gay is debated among fans.[94]Jeffrey Robinson commented, "As the show progressed, the focus changed to melodrama from backstabbing, scheming, murder attempts, love affairs/triangles."[95] The season 5 timeline skip, showing the characters in their lives after high school and college, was successful.[3] It is thought to have successfully avoided jumping the shark, and viewership returned to an all-time high.[96] Ginia Bellefante of The New York Times, on the other hand, said, "Not one of the newly minted 22-year-olds on One Tree Hill blogs or dresses coolly or speaks cleverly or gives any indication of having learned anything at all in college." She characterized the portrayal of twenty-somethings as "so wildly inauthentic and unfamiliar as to make watching it feel like foreign correspondence" but added that "One Tree Hill is a no-arrogance, no-entitlement zone, and Im (shamefully) happy to pull up and park".[69] AOL TV placed the show in its list of TV's Biggest Guilty Pleasures.[97]The series premiere was watched by 2.5 million viewers and achieved a 1.9 Adults 1849 rating on September 23, 2003. The following week, it rose to 3.3 million and a 2.4 demo,[jargon] becoming one of the three shows to rise in its second episode in the 20032004 TV season.[98]The CW only attracts a fraction of the audience its competitors do. "So the strategy is super-serving a young coveted demographics. The network's sweet spot is women 1834 and with a viewer median age of 33, it boasts the youngest audience among its broadcast competitors by almost a dozen years."[99] Averaging 4.3 million viewers weekly, season two was One Tree Hill's highest-rated season.[4] During this season, the show emerged as one of The WBs hits. "Of all the shows that theyve launched in the last two years, this one has the most traction," said Stacey Lynn Koerner, at the time an executive vice president at Initiative, a media planning agency. "It does have an audience its connecting with a loyal audience that comes back week in and week out." The show was particularly popular among the young viewership. It became the first choice of prime-time television for teenage girls and was reported in January 2005 to be the program in Tuesday's 9 pm time slot most viewed by women aged 12 to 34.[47]The series finale was the highest rated among women 18-34 (1.4/4) for The CW in more than a year. It was The CWs best Wednesday night in adults 18-34 since premiere week which took place on September 14, 2011 and best adults 18-49 and women 18-49 ratings since December 7, 2011. Comparing to a year earlier, One Tree Hill's last episode was up 50% in adults 18-34, 40% in women 18-34 and 33% in adults 18-49.[100] The first hour of the finale event, a series of interviews with the cast, garnered approximately 1.37 million viewers, with 1.42 million tuning in for the actual series finale.[101]Below are the seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of One Tree Hill on The WB and The CW.Over its 9 year run, One Tree Hill has been nominated and won various awards, most commonly in the Teen Choice Awards.On February 7, 2007, SOAPnet announced that it would broadcast reruns of The O.C. and One Tree Hill. The deal, made with the show's production company Warner Brothers, stated that SOAPnet retained the option of picking up the fifth season for syndication. SOAPnet did so, starting to air season 5 episodes in January 2009.[119]Seasons 19 of One Tree Hill have been released on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4, with commentary on selected episodes by cast and crew members, deleted scenes, gag reels and featurettes. Four box set collectors' editions have also been released: the first in August 2009 containing the complete seasons 16, and the second in August 2010 containing seasons 17 and in 2011 seasons 1-8. On May 12, the complete box set of One Tree Hill was revealed, with a release date of June 11, 2012. This box set was initially for sale in the UK only,[120] however, the set will be available in Australia from October 31.[121]One Tree Hill at TV.com 1 Plot2 Cast3 Production

The series, which is TV Land's first original scripted series, premiered on June 16, 2010, and was TV Land's highest rated telecast in the cable network's 14-year history. The series was picked up for ten episodes.[1] On January 12, 2012, TV Land renewed the series for a fourth season.[2]The series was created by Suzanne Martin (Frasier, Ellen) and is executive produced by Martin, Sean Hayes and Todd Milliner, through their production companies SamJen Productions and Hazy Mills Productions, and is produced in association with TV Land.

The first season scored a 65 out of 100 on Metacritic.[34]Hot in Cleveland has been referred to as a modern spin on the classic 1980s television series The Golden Girls in which actress Betty White played a starring role. Craig Berman of Today stated that the show is "as close as we're likely to get to a repeat of White's 1980s ensemble comedy hit, The Golden Girls... [TV Land] the network known as the refuge for people looking to fall asleep to reruns of shows from their childhood has made its first scripted program a modern version of the classic sitcom premise."[35] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times commented: "This is the first original scripted comedy on TV Land, a network that was founded on reruns. So not surprisingly, Hot in Cleveland is a pastiche of classics a little bit Cheers and Frasier, a little bit The Golden Girls."[36] Michael Musto of The Village Voice wrote: "Wendie Malick is basically the modern-day Bea Arthur. Sweet-faced Valerie Bertinelli is the new Betty White. Been-around Jane Leeves is the nouveau Rue McClanahan. And witheringly sarcastic Golden Girl Betty White has turned into Estelle Getty."[37]Betty White received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her role as Elka Ostrovsky, and went on to win the award. The cast received a nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.On May 17, 2011, TV Land entered the show in the race for the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards.

Kessler (collectively known as KZK). It premiered on July 24, 2007 on FX and aired for three seasons before moving to the DirecTV channel Audience Network in 2010, where it aired for a further two seasons, concluding with the fifth season.[1][2]The series revolves around the brilliant, ruthless lawyer Patty Hewes (Glenn Close) and her protge Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne). For the first few seasons the series centers around the law firm Hewes & Associates (located in New York City). Each season features a major case that Hewes and her firm take on, while also examining a chapter of the complicated relationship between Ellen and Patty. Later seasons center more on Patty and Ellen's relationship as Ellen begins to distance herself from Patty and begins to concentrate on her independent career.Known for its depiction of season-long cases from the point of view of both the law firm and the target, the series is noted for its plot twists, nonlinear narrative, technical merit, season-long storylines, and the acting ability of its cast. The series has attracted many stars to play characters on the side against Hewes, including; Ted Danson, William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden, Martin Short, Lily Tomlin, John Goodman, Dylan Baker, and Ryan Phillippe. The series has received widespread critical acclaim and several television award nominations, with Close and first-season co-star eljko Ivanek winning a Primetime Emmy Award for their performances, while several of the other performers have been nominated as well.Creators Todd A. Kessler, Glenn Kessler and Daniel Zelman devised the series as the relationship between a mentor and a protge: two women in powerful positions. Although the initial story idea did not have the series set in the legal arena, the creators chose it because they felt the legal world included women who commanded power and influence.[3] The concept was inspired by the creators' interaction with their superiors along with their experiences in the entertainment industry.[4] The series steers away from usual legal dramas, where storyline is set inside the courtroom and instead describes the characters' lives and interactions outside the courtroom and the behind-the-scenes power maneuvering and manipulation.[4] About the characters of the show Zelman notes, "We don't look at any of the characters as good or bad or anything like that. What really motivated us to write about this world, first and foremost, was our interest in power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society."[5]The series was designed with the main character, Patty Hewes, tackling one case per season.[6] The first season of the series focuses on a class-action lawsuit against the fraudulent multi-billionaire CEO of a defunct company. The plot was inspired by various corporate scandals and characters involved in them,[7] most notably from the 2001 scandal surrounding Enron.[8] The second season deals with the energy industry and related environmental issues. The story is influenced by recent and ongoing environmental cases in the United States in the mining industry and also by the events of the 2001 California energy crisis.[9] The writers were guided by environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who shared his experience in the field with various corporations and CEOs.[10] The third season is largely based on the 2009 epic Bernie Madoff scandal, with veiled references and similarities to the case of the collapse of the Stanford Financial Group of companies and their use of Antigua's opaque banking laws.The series uses nonlinear narrative while employing flashforwards, foreshadowing and red herring narration techniques. This approach has given the writers flexibility in storytelling.[11] The narrative handles multiple plot lines and has loose ends. Zelman explains, "We know where were going. We have tent-pole moments that were building to all the way through to the end, and its very clear to us where we want to end up. [However], we want to leave room for improvisation..."[7] While the two different time-frames format was initially intended for the first season, in preparation for the second season the producers felt that the nonlinear format had become a signature of the series and decided to continue it for the second season.[12] With the serialized format of the show decreasing the viewership,[11] Todd Kessler contended that the second season would contain stand-alone storylines to make the show more accessible.[13]When creators Kesslers and Zelman pitched the show to executives at FX, network president John Landgraf suggested that they should consider Glenn Close for the main character Patty Hewes.[14] Close had earlier worked on FX's The Shield and had conveyed to the network officials that she would be interested to be cast as a lead in another show, so long as the show was set in New York City.[15] After a three-hour meeting with the creators, Close accepted the role, impressed particularly by the powerful persona of the character "as the head of her own law firm [...] in a male-dominated world."[7] In preparation for the role, Close met with several female attorneys in New York, including Mary Jo White, Lorna Scofield and Patricia Hynes.[14] The creators chose Ted Danson for the part of Arthur Frobisher, a corrupt billionaire CEO, because of his role in the 1979 film The Onion Field.[15] Danson was immediately attracted to the project after he learned that Close would be playing the lead role.[16] As part of preparation, Danson studied the collapse of Enron by watching documentaries such as The Smartest Guys in the Room and meeting CEOs of various Fortune 500 corporations.[17] The producers also suggested that Danson consult Close's acting coach Harold Guskin. Danson was initially hesitant about this suggestion, but found the consultation extremely helpful.[18]Series cast members Rose Byrne and Tate Donovan, portraying Ellen Parsons and Tom Shayes respectively, secured their parts through auditions. Byrne had been unavailable the first time she was approached because she was shooting the film 28 Weeks Later, but was able to audition later when the part had not yet been cast.[8] Both Byrne and Donovan prepared for their roles by consulting lawyers and attending court trials.[19] According to producers, the characters of Ellen's fianc David Connor and his sister Katie were the hardest to cast.[3]For the first season cast, Noah Bean, who got the role of David, said he "gave an awful first audition," but managed to get the part when he was given a second chance while waiting for an elevator.[3] When British actor Anastasia Griffith auditioned for the part of Katie Connor, the producers were hesitant to have a British actor play an American, especially since they already had an Australian (Byrne) playing an American. However Griffith convinced the producers by speaking in an American accent throughout their follow-up meeting.[20] At the time of casting, Griffith's role was intended only for three episodes, but was extended after the producers realized the success of the character.[4] eljko Ivanek scored the initially very-minor role of Ray Fiske through an audition, but as producers watched Ivanek's work in the dailies they beefed up the role considerably.[21]For the second season cast, Marcia Gay Harden was, according to producer Josh Payne, a "no-brainer" for the role of Claire Maddox. They wanted an actress that could hold her own against Close. Harden's casting was also due in part to the fact that she lived in New York City where Damages shoots.[22] William Hurt and Timothy Olyphant were cast late in the process. The producers debated whether they should go with one actor that created a love triangle involving Patty and Ellen, but they ultimately went with the two separate actors.[23]For the third season cast, Lily Tomlin's casting evolved out of her fandom for the show. At an art exhibit she bumped into creator/exec. producer Todd A. Kessler, and interrogated him for information about upcoming twists on the show. Todd kept her in mind, and later cast her as Marilyn Tobin.[24] Dominic Chianese was also cast because of his past relationship with Kessler, as the two worked together on The Sopranos.[25] Martin Short was the last major actor to be cast that season; he too was a Damages fan. Producers were excited to work with Martin, though he had very little dramatic work to refer to; he added to the Damages reputation of casting against-type.[26]For the fourth season cast, producers initially considered actors like Edward Burns and Wentworth Miller for the role of Howard T. Erickson because they were closer in age/physique to Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater whom the season was based on. John Goodman stressed his availability and the role was tailored to suit his style.[27] Creator Daniel Zelman saw Dylan Baker on stage years ago when Daniel was an apprentice at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts. His performance left an impression, and producers had thought about casting him several times before and the timing didnt work out until Season 4, where he was cast as Jerry Boorman.[28] Chris Messina at his first casting call, refused to play a Republican or a lawyer on the show because he was repeatedly cast in such roles beforehand. He was awarded the role of PTSD-plagued Chris Sanchez, and went through considerable preparation for the role. He would "stay awake and not sleep...and right before action...drink two Red Bulls." He was also reluctant to join a show so late in its run.[29] The role of Bill Herndon was, like with Ray Fiske or Katie Connor, conceived as a very minor role but was significantly increased after Judd Hirsch made a good impression.[30]For the fifth season cast, Ryan Phillippe initially wasn't too interested in doing Damages, but on a phone call with producers he changed his mind after being told his character was modeled after Julian Assange, with whom Phillippe was fascinated.[31] Jenna Elfman followed in the steps of Ted Danson, Martin Short, and other well-known comic actors by playing against-type on Damages. She enthusiastically signed on for the opportunity to "play the types of scenes I haven't yet had the opportunity to play."[32] Janet McTeer became close friends with Glenn Close while working on the film Albert Nobbs, and Close worked with producers to offer her a key role in the fifth season.[33]The title sequence, set to the song "When I Am Through with You" by The VLA, depicts images of New York City public sculpture, including "The Glory of Commerce" atop Grand Central Terminal, "Civic Fame" atop the Manhattan Municipal Building, and "Asia" in front of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House. The frieze of the New York County Supreme Court Building is also shown, inscribed with a quote from George Washington, "The true administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good government." The title sequence, produced by the graphic design firm BigStar, was nominated for a People's Design Award, awarded by the Smithsonian Institution's CooperHewitt, National Design Museum.The series cast consists of Glenn Close, Rose Byrne, Ted Danson, Tate Donovan, eljko Ivanek and Noah Bean.A young woman, Ellen Parsons, is found running through the streets half naked and covered in blood. Investigation by the police reveals that her fianc, David, has been bludgeoned to death in their apartment, and Ellen is quickly arrested.The scene shifts to six months earlier when Ellen, a newly minted lawyer, is being courted for prestigious jobs. She turns down an offer to work with the defense attorney Hollis Nye (Philip Bosco) in favor of working for notorious lawyer Patty Hewes. When Nye finds out about this, he warns Ellen that working for Patty will change her.Ellen soon becomes engrossed in the major case which Patty's firm, Hewes and Associates, is pursuing. Hewes and Associates has been retained in a class action suit by the former employees of billionaire Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson). In a case reminiscent of Enron, Frobisher is accused of insider trading and lying to his employees about the health of his company even as he unloaded hundreds of millions of his own stock, depriving his employees of their retirements and benefits.Early on in the series Patty shows that she is willing to go to extreme, even unethical and illegal, lengths to win her case. One such instance is when she has the pet dog of a reluctant witness killed in a manner which makes it look as if Frobisher is responsible. This action emboldens the witness to testify against Frobisher.As the season progresses Ellen becomes more and more involved in the case, and in Patty's shady dealings. Part of this is due to Ellen's personal connections to the case. Her fianc's sister turns out to be an important witness in the case. For most of the season Ellen skirts the edge of what is unethical, but eventually comes to cross that line.As Ellen becomes more and more devoted to the case, her relationship with her fianc becomes strained. The situation is not helped when Patty betrays his sister. Eventually Ellen and David tire of Patty and Ellen publicly leaves Hewes and Associates. However, she still has an interest in the case and soon becomes personally embroiled in it again.Throughout the first season, the series plays with time. The narrative switches back and forth between a traditional linear narrative of events happening in "the past" and a more temporally disjointed narrative of events happening in "the present." The main plot focus of these flashes was the murder of Ellen's fianc David and the apparent attack on Ellen that same day when she was staying at Patty's apartment. The flashes served to increase speculation among viewers since the audience was privy to information about the future which the characters were not. Until the final episode, speculation over the identity of the murderer switched between a whole host of characters including Ellen, Patty, Frobisher, and a stalker whom David acquired.By the end of the first season the main narrative of the show has "caught up" with the flash forwards and most of the questions raised by them are resolved. The murder charges against Ellen are dropped. The identities of David's murderer and Ellen's attacker are revealed to the audience, and the Frobisher case is resolved with Frobisher giving up two billion dollars of his own fortune to the employees, in exchange for no criminal charges being filed against him. He is later shot and left for dead by a former employee he double crossed earlier by manipulating him for information.Glenn Close, Rose Byrne, and Tate Donovan returned as regulars for the second season. Season 1 recurring star Anastasia Griffith became a regular and season 1 regular Ted Danson returned for five episodes. William Hurt, Timothy Olyphant and Marcia Gay Harden joined the cast. John Doman guest starred.Season 2 begins with once naive young attorney Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne) talking to an unknown person off-screen. Suddenly, she pulls a gun into the frame and pulls the trigger twice.Six months earlier, a mysterious scientist named Daniel Purcell (William Hurt) sends Patty (Glenn Close) a box of documents after her victory over Arthur Frobisher. Purcell asks for Patty's help, proclaiming he is being threatened, but she refuses. The following night, Purcell's wife, Christine (Paige Turco), turns up dead and Patty agrees to help him. As the case of the murder unfolds, Patty realizes that there is a major conspiracy taking place between Purcell's scientific firm and a huge energy corporation, Ultima National Resources. As they continue to make headway the case rolls on. Over time, the presumed killer of Purcell's wife is arrested and the corporation's environmental hazards are exposed. When Patty is moments away from bringing UNR down, however, Daniel turns on her in open court and defends UNR. We later realize that Purcell has been working for UNR all along and he is indirectly yet knowingly responsible for the murder of his wife. UNR CEO Walter Kendrick (John Doman) is revealed to be merging his company with another corporation for reasons far more complicated, bizarre and secretive than meet the eye. When Patty realizes this, she decides to use a plaintiff of the UNR lawsuit to stop what could happen. She is then able to convince Frobisher (Ted Danson) to become involved, to repair his image. Meanwhile, unbeknown to Patty and the remaining plaintiffs, Kendrick's attorney, Claire Maddox (Marcia Gay Harden), had an affair with Purcell. Claire at this time is unaware of Kendrick's involvement in Christine's murder.The mystery of the murder later comes to a close when it is discovered that Purcell choked his wife when she threatened to tell the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency about UNR's contamination. He thought he had killed her, but she was still alive when Deacon (Darrell Hammond) arrives at the house. Kendrick tells Deacon to finish the job. He does just that, leaving Purcell to think he had murdered his wife. Purcell cannot bear the guilt and confesses to police that he murdered his wife.Ellen, meanwhile, still under the impression that Patty had tried to have her killed, is working with Agent Werner (Glenn Kessler) and Agent Harrison (Mario van Peebles) of the FBI to bring her down. The audience discovers it was possible that it was Uncle Pete who commissioned Ellen's attempted murder. In grief counseling, Ellen meets and befriends a mysterious loner named Wes Krulik (Timothy Olyphant) and begins to confide in him. Wes, however, is secretly working with Rick Messer, the police detective on Frobisher's payroll who had murdered David Connor and who is still working for Frobisher. Krulik also has a shrine of newspaper articles on Arthur Frobisher, articles about David's murder, and articles from Ellen's arrest, as well as a large variety of guns and other weapons. As the season closes, Wes refuses to follow Detective Messer's order to kill Ellen, as Ellen has begun to suspect police involvement. As Messer tries to lure Ellen into a trap, Wes executes Messer in the season finale.When Katie (Anastasia Griffith) re-enters Ellen's life, she begins to bring up old conflicts as well as new issues. Katie recognized a police officer as the man who tried to kill her. She told Ellen, who enlisted Patty's help. They got nowhere, so Katie went to the police dept. and filed a report against him. This led to an argument between Ellen and Katie, with Katie claiming that if Ellen had never met Patty, David would still be alive. Katie questions Ellen's reasoning for going back to Patty. Ellen attempts to explain that she has her reasons, reasons that Katie would not understand. When Messer realizes that his partner's cover has been blown, he shoots and kills him.Frobisher returns as a plaintiff against UNR for Patty in an effort to "get his name back". This creates an opportunity for Ellen to find new information and eventually link Frobisher to Detective Messer's agency. Wes recovers this information and lets Messer know, and he threatens Frobisher's life, forcing him to pull out of the case. Messer's problems continue. However, as Wes begins to develop feelings for Ellen, he wonders if Wes can be trusted. When he tells Wes to take Ellen out, Wes refuses until Messer brings up his past and Wes feels he has no choice but to comply.Walter Kendrick is now initiating a merger which is discovered to be a scheme to make money based on manipulated energy fraud. His partner, Dave Pell (Clarke Peters), has much more incentive than Kendrick because he has a relationship with Patty's husband Phil (Michael Nouri). Pell makes Phil a tempting offer, which Phil accepts. It is at that time that Phil's extramarital affair comes to light. When it is leaked to the press, Patty kicks him out of their house and Phil is no longer considered a candidate. We also find that Pell has been talking to the FBI with information on Patty. Subsequently, when Agent Werner's cover is blown, Pell executes Harrison.Kendrick's illegal activities continue. When Claire attacks Patty, Patty mentions Fin Garrity (Kevin Corrigan), the energy trader being used by Walter and Dave. Claire begins to realize she is being used in a conspiracy and asks for the assistance of Daniel. Claire lets the idea of power get the best of her, realizing she could head up UNR. A suspicious Kendrick catches her having sexual relations with Daniel. Kendrick uses this to get Claire thrown out of UNR, and she immediately goes to Patty saying, "I want you to destroy him." Claire tells Patty that she can trust Daniel Purcell. Patty therefore successfully uses Purcell to crack the energy codes which gives Patty enough evidence to testify against UNR in court.Tate Donovan returns as Patty's partner Tom Shayes. After he is given an infant mortality case which the FBI wanted Patty to take in order to bring her down, the witness asked Tom for some money to hold her over until the trial or she would go to another attorney. He was about to hand over the money until Patty heard about the bribe and convinced Tom to join her in the case against UNR. While chasing a lead to find out more information on Fin Garrity, Tom is propositioned by a call girl. It is unknown whether Tom gave in to her advances. Despite being named a partner with Patty, he is still left in the dark when it comes to certain issues regarding the case. Tom's wife also just gave birth to a son this season.Patty realizes that victory in the UNR case relies on the GPS code from Walter Kendrick's Cadillac to be entered into evidence. Because the car was stolen to retrieve the codes, it cannot be entered into evidence. To fix this, Patty puts Ellen up to the task of bribing the judge. But Patty soon takes back the request and gives the job to Tom. After Ellen and Agent Werner were planning to use this to bring down Patty, they target Tom and take him into custody, citing his almost-bribe with Agent Hawkins in the infant mortality case as the reason, while he is on his way to the hospital where his wife is giving birth. Ellen convinces Tom to wear a wire and he goes back to Patty and turns down the job of bribing the judge, and urging Patty not to do so either. Angry, Patty fires Tom for letting her down.In the season finale, Ellen convinces Patty to bribe the judge after the judge makes it clear that in the current state of the case, he will not allow the evidence of the stolen SUV (a subtle hint to Patty's firm that he needs a payoff). Ellen feels she has Patty setup and arranges with Agent Werner to monitor the payoff. Meanwhile Patty confronts Fin Garrity, the energy trader involved with UNR. This sets off a chain reaction between Garrity, Kendrick, and Patty and which causes Garrity to seek out Patty as she is taking the bribe to hand over to Ellen at Ellen's hotel room. In the run-up to the final confrontation between Patty and Ellen (alluded to in flash forwards all season), Patty makes a deal with Pell. Pell will call off the FBI and reveals Ellen to be the insider working for the Feds. Patty gets Pell to hand over the data that UNR is using toxic chemicals. In return, Patty will drop the energy trading angle of the case. She also sets up Ellen as the fall guy for bribing the judge. Ellen, meanwhile, works a deal with Tom, procuring a handgun in the process, after Wes refuses to get her one.Ellen confronts Patty about her actions from season one. She has evidence from Uncle Pete's wife that she feels is proof Patty set her up to be killed. However, when she hands the evidence to Patty, the folder is shown to hold only a message that the Feds are watching, not the evidence of Patty's involvement with Ellen's attempted murder. Ellen fires two shots at Patty, but instead of aiming for Patty, she aims at the camera installed by the FBI. She then gets Patty's confession that she indeed was responsible for setting up Ellen to be murdered. Satisfied with the confession, Ellen leaves with the bribe for the judge. Patty leaves after Ellen, but is shown to be bleeding. Patty is found in the elevator by Agent Werner, who assumes Ellen shot Patty and leaves to pursue Ellen. Wes, who was monitoring Ellen from across the hall, also finds Patty (right after Agent Werner leaves) and gets her to the hospital. It is revealed that Patty had been stabbed by Fin Garrity on the elevator before her confrontation with Ellen. When Ellen bribes the judge, Agent Werner has her and the Judge arrested for bribery. As they leave, Federal Marshals (led by Tom's sister) arrest Agent Werner for corruption. Tom reveals to Ellen that Patty, apparently, had discovered the FBI scheme and worked with him to record the conversation with Pell. This leads to both Kendrick and Pell getting arrested. The season ends one month later with Patty recovering at home, Tom returning to Patty's firm, and Ellen with a new unrevealed job offer (and out of touch with Hewes and Associates). However, Patty states she feels that Ellen will be in contact with them soon.Glenn Close, Rose Byrne, and Tate Donovan returned as regulars for the third season. Season 1 regular Ted Danson returned for five episodes. Martin Short and Campbell Scott joined the cast. Lily Tomlin and Keith Carradine special guest starred.At the start of season three, Patty is involved in a car accident. The other car belongs to her partner, Tom Shayes, who is later found dead in a dumpster. It is implied that Ellen is involved in Tom's death, as her blood-stained purse is found among a homeless man's belongings. Prior to his death, Tom is seen handing Ellen a bag full of money from Leonard Winstone, the Tobin family's attorney. The police discover that Tom had drowned, and died two hours after Patty's accident. When Patty finds out about his death, we see her making a phone call, hysterical, screaming "I told you not to go through with it! I don't understand, I told you to stop!"When Detective Huntley questions Ellen, he discusses what the homeless man told him and asks if she was romantically involved with Tom. Ellen replies "We were starting a law firm together."Six months earlier, Patty Hewes is tackling a new case. Appointed a trustee by the US government, she is tasked to recover billions of dollars lost to the largest investment fraud in Wall Street history; a fraudulent Ponzi scheme run by Louis Tobin (Len Cariou), a Bernie Madoff-type. Patty believes Tobin has hidden the money, and that members of his family, most notably his loyal son Joe (Campbell Scott), his secretive wife Marilyn (Lily Tomlin), daughter Carol, and his trusted attorney and family friend Leonard Winstone (Martin Short), know much more than they claim to. It is revealed that Tom has a personal involvement in the case; he invested in the Tobin fund and lost his savings, which compromises his professional involvement. Ellen, meanwhile, has stayed true to her promise not to return to Patty, and has not seen her for the past year that she has been working at the District Attorney's office. Ellen runs into Tom and she mentions she has trouble cracking a drug case. Shortly afterward, Ellen's case is suddenly resolved under suspicious circumstances, and she receives a package from Hewes & Associates containing an expensive Chanel bag from Patty (the same bloodstained bag that ends up in the hands of the homeless man). While Hewes & Associates is working on recovering money for the victims, the District Attorney's office is only interested in bringing criminal charges against the Tobin family. Believing Hewes and Associates is more capable than the district attorney to bring about restitution, Ellen starts to secretly cooperate with Patty and Tom and they all get drawn into the Tobin family's world of lies and deceit.The story begins on Thanksgiving night when Louis Tobin tells his family the truth about the fraud. Knowing he will be imprisoned, he shares his secrets with his much-loved but weak son Joe. The night before his prison sentence is set to begin, Louis Tobin commits suicide, leaving Joe to take responsibility for the disgraced family. A recovering alcoholic and a disappointment to his father, Joe finds Louis's body along with a potassium mixture his physician supplied earlier that night and an envelope addressed to Patty Hewes. The envelope contains all details about the fraud and instructions on how to recover the hidden money. Joe must decide whether to give the money up and clear his name or risk imprisonment and take care of the family and its future. Not wishing to lose his wife and son and wanting to provide for his mother, Joe chooses money over the truth and begins working with the family's lawyer, Leonard Winstone, to follow his father's conspiracy plan. Leonard, who was intensely loyal to Louis and considers himself part of the Tobin family, shifts his allegiance to Joe. Already devastated by his father's fraud and death, Joe learns his old flame, Danielle Marchetti (Mdchen Amick), had an affair with his father that resulted in a daughter, his half-sister. Her involvement with Louis may have drastic influence on the family's future with regard to Patty finding the money. Joe crumbles under the pressure and starts drinking again, spiraling out of control. Leonard has him followed and is prepared to have him committed to rehab to prevent compromising the family further; but Joe realizes how important he is to the family and stops drinking. As more obstacles and threats appear and the plan to recover the family fortune is endangered, his remaining moral integrity becomes more compromised. He almost lets his ex-girlfriend and his father's mistress die, trying to get her out of the country so she could not testify against them.Danielle doesn't escape death though and after a brief visit by Carol Tobin, Joe's sister, Danielle is found poisoned with the same mixture Louis Tobin used to invoke his heart attack. Joe and Leonard are recovering the money through Louis Tobin's old friend, shady businessman Mr. Zedeck. The money is stashed in a secret account in Antigua in the Caribbean, transported to the US in smaller amounts by a courier and then laundered through a charity. The courier is a young flight attendant and no one else but Danielle Marchetti's daughter Tessa. Tessa makes weekly visits to the bank but seems to think she is signing legitimate documents to receive her salary, unaware of any fraud. Fond of Louis Tobin, whom she believes was her father, she withholds information that could incriminate the family and make her a witness for Patty and the DA.Joe is pleased with Tessa at first but she's contacted by the lawyers repeatedly Joe expresses concerns about her loyalty. Leonard hastily meets with Marilyn Tobin, telling her that Tessa isn't safe and that Joe needs to know the truth. Marilyn promises to tell Joe that Tessa is, in fact, his daughter. Meanwhile, Tessa is approached by both by Patty and the DA's office and when Tom desperately tries to make her testify and he tells her Tobins killed her mother, she agrees to cooperate. Tessa is found dead together with Patty's private investigator Malcolm in Antigua where they were trying to obtain the documents from the bank. Leonard is seen talking to Marilyn Tobin again, clearly outraged she did not tell Joe the truth, thus causing Tessa's death. With that, each member of the family has caused somebody's death.After Tessa's demise, Patty is desperate and the case stalls. Patty decides the only way to win is to "rip that family apart". Carol is guilt-ridden over killing Danielle and is the first to be apprehended for her crime. Joe receives information about their attorney Leonard Winstone, who turns out to be a small-time crook with stolen identity and no law degree so Joe fires him. In return, Leonard and his career-criminal father get access to the account and make withdrawals without the knowledge of Joe or Mr. Zedeck. Marilyn Tobin eventually tells Joe that his father only devised the fraud to cover up Joe's mistake which left his investors high and dry. Joe is furious, tells his mother she will never see him or her grandson again and kicks her out. Marilyn gets drunk and sentimental watching old home videos, leaves home, takes a taxi and just asks the driver to take her to the East River and jumps off the bridge. Her body is later found in the water. With nothing left to lose, Joe decides to find Tom whom he blames for losing his house, family, and everything.In the meantime, Tom has made a deal with Winstone. Tom and Ellen promise Winstone immunity from prosecution in return for money for Tom and the envelope Louis Tobin left on the night of his death. Ellen meets with Winstone to present him with the immunity deal and Winstone takes her purse without her noticing. Patty doesn't trust Winstone and has an odd feeling about the arrangement and instructs Tom and Ellen not to go through with the deal. But Tom is motivated by being scammed himself and refuses to let go of his chance for revenge. Winstone and Tom meet so that Winstone can give Tom the money, but first Winstone replaces Ellen's purse in Tom's car. Seeing this, Tom's homeless friend steals the purse. After Winstone leaves, Zedeck's associate shows up asking about Winstone's whereabouts. When Tom can't tell him, he stabs Tom. It appears he might be killed but is saved by Leonard in the last moment. Tom, Zedeck's associate and Winstone fight and it appears that only Tom survives. He asks his homeless friend to do something for him. Injured, Tom makes his way home. Joe finds Tom, bleeding in the bathroom of his house and after Tom calls Louis Tobin a thief, Joe becomes enraged, drowns Tom in the toilet and puts his body in a dumpster. Meanwhile Tom's homeless friend begins to take care of things in the flat where Tom was stabbed, and he realizes that Winstone is still alive. Winstone calls Ellen to let her know he left the evidence in her purse because he didn't trust Tom or Patty. When he hangs up, we see he has a bag full of money and is boarding a flight. Ellen, knowing that the purse was recovered from a homeless man, goes to find him where he lives and he gives her the envelope with the evidence Winstone provided. Joe is arrested and after a short, private talk with Patty, confesses all.Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson) returns, launching his new environmentally-friendly company. He is working with an actor (Craig Bierko), who originally showed little interest in working with him beyond an investment. However, after reading Arthur's book, he decides that he wants to make this into a movie about Frobisher's case against Patty  and he is given the film rights to the book in exchange for being Frobisher's company spokesman. In the season finale, Ellen contacts Wes who comes back to tell her of his previous covert role and execution of Messer, who murdered her fiance David. He offers to help her convict Frobisher, but she rejects his offer on the grounds she does not want Wes to go to prison. Wes nonetheless later corners Frobisher at gunpoint in his car and with Frobisher begging for his life, Wes calls the police to confess everything. Frobisher's last scene is sitting in the back of a police car under arrest for murder, trying to figure out how he can get off.The relationship between Patty and Ellen is different than in past seasons, because they have reached a point of clarity and distance between them. The unspoken bond between the two resurfaces as they work on the same case. Throughout the third season, Ellen is trying to prove that she can get to and manipulate Patty although she never really succeeds. Ellen is bitter about being replaced by a new, young and highly ambitious girl, Alex, who is willing to do just about anything to get the job and please Patty. Unaware of the animosity, Alex comes to Ellen for advice and Ellen is sabotaging her every step of the way. Patty eventually gets tired of Alex being so submissive and enslaved and fires her anyway. Patty is trying to come to terms with her son Michael being grown up and leaving home but she cannot overcome the fact he is dating a woman (Jill) at least fifteen years his senior. When Patty finds out the couple is expecting a baby, she decides to step in and offers Jill money to leave her son and the city. Jill returns to accept the offer, asks for five hundred thousand but breaks the conditions of the deal, stays with Michael and spends the money on a luxury car and an apartment. Before long, Jill finds herself in custody for having sex with a minor and about to lose everything including her freedom and the baby. In one brief moment we learn that indeed the car that hit Patty was driven by Michael, raging because of Jill's incarceration.Ellen too deals with a family crisis when her sister is arrested on a drug charge. She denies selling drugs and blames a friend for ratting on her. Ellen uses Malcolm, Patty's investigator, to try to help but digs out her sister was lying to her all along and has been dealing drugs for some time. Ellen decides not to help her out of jail to straighten her out but also not to tarnish her reputation at work. Finally, we also learn about an old and painful secret Patty has been keeping for years. Through memories and dreams Patty repeatedly sees herself, highly pregnant, walking somewhere up to a ranch with horses and a man she briefly talks to. He asks her what she's doing so far away from her home in her condition and Patty answers her doctor said she'd be ok. In a flashback Patty is talking to a doctor and they agree that the child is more important than school, work or anything else. In another flashback however, the doctor is telling Patty she absolutely must stay in bed and avoid any physical activity or else the baby will die. Then her memories and dreams reveal the walk and that she started bleeding at the ranch. Following Tom's funeral, Patty indirectly admits to Ellen that she brought on the miscarriage so that she could go to New York and accept an important job offer thus beginning her climb to the top of the legal profession. Ellen then asks her "Is it worth it?". Patty doesn't reply, and Ellen leaves.Glenn Close and Rose Byrne returned as regulars for the fourth season. John Goodman and Dylan Baker joined the cast.

And if you want to see some prime, grade-A Acting, well, you could do a lot worse."[41] While TV Guide's Matt Roush gave it a 91 and stated that "Damages is worth it. And for those without access to DirecTV, worth the wait."[42]Damages is a winner of 4 Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe, a Casting Society of America Award, and a Satellite Award. It has been nominated for a Producers Guild of America Award, a Writers Guild of America Award, 4 Screen Actors Guild Awards, and 4 Television Critics Association Awards, among others.For its first season, Damages was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series at the 2008 Primetime Emmy Awards, along with six other nominations.

Season Two premiered with only 1.7million viewers watching, even with the momentum that was built following its Golden Globe and Emmy wins. Despite the show's low ratings, FX picked up and secured the program for a third season. John Landgraf hoped the show would continue on the air following its third season; after taking into account the encore presentations and "extraordinary" DVR numbers, the ratings appeared to be quite good.[54]The third season premiere, which aired on January 25, 2010, only managed to draw in 1.483million viewers,.[55] The third season finale managed to pull in only 960,000 viewers.[56]Due to the low ratings and high costs, it was speculated early that Season 3 might be the last season of Damages.

There she meets her new roommate and team captain Savannah Monroe, the injured flyer Alice Verdura, her new partner Lewis Flynn and the Hellcats coach Vanessa Lodge who hopes to win nationals, otherwise the cheer leading program will be cut. All the while, Marti also has to deal with her financially unstable and sometimes irresponsible mother, Wanda Perkins, whom she often has to bail out of difficult situations, and her best friend Dan Patch.Marti Perkins (Aly Michalka) is the protagonist of the series and a townie from Memphis, Tennessee. Described as "wicked smart", she is a pre-law student at Lancer University. Her mother, Wanda Perkins (Gail O'Grady), works at the university pub and is a party girl who never grew up. Her mother's behavior is, for the most part, an embarrassment to Marti. When Lancer's administrative department cuts scholarships for Lancer employees and families, Marti learns she can get a new one by choosing one of Lancer's programs. She then auditions for a position on Lancer's cheerleading team, the Hellcats.Savannah Monroe (Ashley Tisdale), the captain of the Hellcats, is described as "peppy and petite" with a "fierce intensity". She initially clashes with Marti, but realizes she is the godsend that the Hellcats need to win the championship. She votes for Marti when the team has auditions for a new flyer. Savannah is from a very religious southern family. After a fight with her family, she left the university she was attending, Memphis Christian, and transferred to secular Lancer.

He was once a star on the Lancer football team but quit when he discovered a scandal of players being paid by the college.

Morgan Pepper (Craig Anderson) is a pre-law student and Marti's classmate. He later befriends Marti and joins her to solve a legal case introduced by their teacher Julian (Gale Harold). Other Hellcats members include Darwin (Jeremy Wong), a gay cheerleader, and Frankie (Alana Randall). Kathy (Magda Apanowicz) is a member of the Cyclones, usually called "Nasty Kathy"."Through that book we were able to understand that there was a whole world here that hadn't been tapped into and Kevin Murphy was able to go in and bring it to life and create this universe for these characters. I just think it's a great story. I think there's a lot of heart. I think there's a lot of struggle for all of our characters, especially our lead and her journey and her finding her identity and what she's going to do with her life. I just found that interesting."Hellcats is based on the book Cheer: Inside the Secret World of College Cheerleaders by journalist Kate Torgovnick and the series has been described as "Election meets Bring It On".[6][7][9] Actor Tom Welling teamed with Kevin Murphy to executive produce the series, which was initially given the name Cheer.[10][11][12] The pilot episode was written by Murphy[13] and directed by Allan Arkush.

Michalka has said that it was difficult for the writers to incorporate her storylines in with the others.[42]During the 2010 Television Critics Association press tour held in Los Angeles on July 29, 2010, lead actresses Michalka and Tisdale were asked about the idea of singing on the show. They stated that they plan to keep their music careers separate from the series, although Michalka advised that she would sing in the fourth episode.[21] In addition to that, Michalka's band 78violet recorded "Belong Here", which served as the theme song for Hellcats. It was later released into digital stores.[43]Executive producer Kevin Murphy confirmed in an interview that a soundtrack would be released for the series, which would include the theme song and other songs recorded for the series. He later added "So we are building a library of material. Once we have enough, we're gonna put it on iTunes and definitely do a soundtrack album."[44] Songs covered for the series include "The Letter"[45] originally by The Box Tops, Sting's "Brand New Day",[46] Squeeze's "Tempted" and The Go-Go's hit "We Got the Beat".[47] Canadian singer Fefe Dobson recorded "Rockstar", an exclusive song for the series that was played during the "A World Full of Strangers" episode.[44] However, "Rockstar" was ultimately released on the iTunes Deluxe Edition of Dobson's album Joy.

Los Angeles Times had a good first impression of the pilot episode, saying Hellcats has a predictable story but, on the other hand, Michalka and Tisdale seem perfect for their roles. The newspaper also wrote the cheerleading world portrayed in the series is a "fun and deep world to explore".[58] The journal later gave a complete review of the series, comparing it to 1983's film Flashdance aimed squarely at audiences too young for Gossip Girl but too old for Hannah Montana.[59]Verne Gay of Newsday praised Michalka's performance in the series,[60] while The Hollywood Reporter praised the series itself and said it has "multilayered characters that defy expectations."[61]Curt Wagner of ChicagoNow said the series is predictable and has unrealistic situations, and criticized the lack of fun in the jokes. The journal also praised Tisdale's performance, claiming she was the one who made him laugh the most.[62] Hellcats has also received positive reviews from Entertainment Weekly and People.[57]Mara Reinstein of Us Weekly gave an early review of the first episode of the series, saying Hellcats has "plenty of winning elements" but added that the series lacks spirit. She also praised the performance and Marti's relationship with her mother.[63] ABC News listed Hellcats as one of the ten best new shows of 2010's fall season and described the series as "almost laughably formulaic" and added it "works like a charm".[64] Brian Lowry of Variety praised the series' promise, and said that the series has a Glee-like element in the script, while also criticizing Michalka and acclaiming O'Grady's performance. Lowry also added Hellcats's premiere "isn't quite unabashedly trashy enough to completely qualify as a guilty pleasure".[65]Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times criticized Michalka's performance and called the series a "soft-porn music video for teenagers".[66] Washington Post's Hank Stuever was critical about the pilot episode, describing it as "mean-spirited, painfully dumb and badly acted." He also wrote Hellcats is the opposite to Fox's Glee.[67]The pilot episode "A World Full of Strangers" averaged a total of 3.0 million viewers and scored a 2.0 rating in the network's target audience of women 1834, which marks the first premiere to ever match or build on an America's Next Top Model lead-in since The CW began.

Kara VallowAmerican Dad! is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Smiths, a dysfunctional family consisting of parents Stan and Francine and their children, budding adolescent Steve and new-age hippie Hayley. Other main characters include Hayley's stoner husband Jeff Fischer; the family's pet, Klaus, a man in a fish's body; and Roger, an alien who Stan has rescued from government capture and harbors in the family's attic.The show is set in the fictional town of Langley Falls, Virginia in the Washington, D.C. metro area, which is a gesture of parody of the actual town of Langley, Virginia, home to the headquarters of the CIA. Unlike its sister shows Family Guy and The Cleveland Show, American Dad! does not use cutaway gags, but rather focuses more on situational humor and non sequiturs.Since its debut on February 6, 2005, the show has broadcast 137 episodes and began airing season 8 on September 30, 2012.[1]American Dad! has been nominated for awards, most prominently two Primetime Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards.[2] American Dad! has also received mixed to positive reviews, mirroring the reception of Family Guy, and has been criticized by watchdog groups such as the Parents Television Council.[3] It holds a TV-14 rating for suggestive dialogue (D), offensive language (L), moderate to strong sexual content (S), and graphic violence (V).American Dad! officially premiered after Fox's broadcast of the Super Bowl XXXIX on February 6, 2005, alongside The Simpsons, with "Pilot". The show debuted to 15 million viewers,[4] with 23 million viewers in overall, alongside The Simpsons with ratings.[5] The show returned on May 1, 2005, with "Threat Levels", obtaining 9.47 million viewers, after the season premiere of the revival of Family Guy.[6]American Dad! centers on the domestic life of its nominal title character, Stan Smith, a staunchly neoconservative Republican CIA agent and self-proclaimed American patriot. His conservatism is deliberately treated in the show as severe intolerance and self-abnegating. He is married to Francine Smith, a ditzy housewife who is trying to make up for her wild past. Their two children are Hayley, a passionately liberal, environmentalist college-aged activist with whom neoconservative Stan almost always butt heads and Steve, a nerdy, wimpy high schooler who is always trying to be popular with the girls, but never can. He constantly attempts to live up to Stan's expectations but can never really measure up to the high standards in place for him. The Smith family is also in possession of two bizarre nonhumans Roger, a fugitive alien from Area 51 whom Stan is covertly housing in defiance of his employer because Stan owes Roger a "life debt"; and Klaus, a goldfish whom the CIA implanted with the brain of an East German Olympic ski jumper.The Smith family resides on 43 Cherry Street, in the fictional community of Langley Falls, Virginia. The town name is a composite of Langley and Great Falls, two unincorporated communities located in Fairfax County.Plots generally center on the misadventures of various family members in their respective realms, as well as raucous interactions between the characters. Recurring themes include Stan's desire to see Steve mature properly (e.g. "The Magnificent Steven"), Roger's desires to establish a life outside of the house (e.g. "A.T. the Abusive Terrestrial"), Francine's desire of breaking out of an overly structured lifestyle (e.g. "Dungeons and Wagons"), Hayley's desire to rebel against her father's politics (e.g. "Stan Knows Best"), and Steve's desire to finally become one of the cool kids and lose his virginity, or at least "get some boob" (e.g. "Big Trouble in Little Langley").In its initial seasons, American Dad! featured a recurring gag in its opening sequence that changed for every episode: changing newspaper headlines, usually featuring a topical, satirical joke directed at the United States Government, the media, or current affairs (such as "Pedophilia Down as Childhood Obesity Goes Up", "Israel Pulls Out of Gaza, Gaza Not Pregnant", or "Economy Takes a Turn, Falls Down Flight of Stairs"). As of Season 4, the opening sequence changed, with the newspaper gag being replaced by Roger wearing a different costume each episode to sing the final "Good morning, USA!" before Stan shoves Roger into the seat and crashes into the flagpole outside the CIA office. Syndicated airings use the costume running gag, regardless of what episode airs.American Dad! has received mixed to positive reviews from critics and scoring an average user score of 7.2/10 on Metacritic.[7] Critics of the show initially focused on the similarities of the show's format and characters to Family Guy, but have also praised the show's more relaxed, approachable tone.Characters from Family Guy and The Cleveland Show have made crossover appearances in American Dad! and vice versa. Family Guy and The Cleveland Show and American Dad! have all made an episode related to the same theme. The Hurricane episode was all the premieres in the 2011 season.The first ever crossover with all three MacFarlane series occurs in Night of the Hurricane, with a hurricane storming through the towns of Stoolbend, Quahog and Langley Falls. In the first part of the crossover, "The Hurricane!", Channel 6 News reporter Larvell makes a meta-reference to the event stating that the hurricane will make its way through Stoolbend, Quahog and Langley Falls (which is referred to as "American Dad town"). The actual crossover of the event takes place at the end of the final part  the American Dad! episode, "Hurricane!", when Stan faces Cleveland Brown and Peter Griffin in a standoff after the hurricane has passed.NotesAmerican Dad! at TV.com1 Production

Brian carelessly asks Stan, "Do I know you?" before walking away and Stan shouts, "Stop pretending I don't exist!"Brian has an epiphany in the episode "Excellence in Broadcasting" where he changes his political views to Republican Conservatism. Once he realizes this, a cut away shows Stan Smith sitting on the couch supposedly watching Brian and says, "Good. Good for Brian."Stan and Deputy Director Avery Bullock attempt to catch Stewie after he breaks into the CIA in "Lois Kills Stewie", where Stewie mistakes Stan for Joe Swanson.In "The Worst Stan", Steve and Roger are watching a fictitious episode of Family Guy featuring Stewie and Brian going to Miami to enroll in Florida State University, with Steve questioning how a baby and a dog were able to get on an airplane.At the end of the Family Guy episode "Meet the Quagmires", Peter is commenting that everything is back to normal when Roger enters the living room and says, "Who ate all the Pecan Sandies?", a reference to the American Dad! pilot.In the first Family Guy Star Wars special "Blue Harvest", Roger is seen as one of the various aliens in the Mos Eisley cantina.In the third Family Guy Star Wars special "It's a Trap!", Roger makes a cameo as an Imperial Officer sent to meet Darth Vader (played by Stewie) when he arrives at the second Death Star and Stewie remarks "Did we run out of our own characters?" Elsewhere in the episode, Klaus plays Admiral Ackbar.In "Killer Queen", Barry is shown as one of the fat kids that is sitting next to Peter Griffin.In the Family Guy episode, "Foreign Affairs", Bonnie remarks to Lois before having an affair, "Joe just isn't the same man I married." The American Dad! opening sequence from the early episodes (in which the running gag that is the newspaper headlines, not the later ones with Roger in a different costume) is then shown, with Joe replacing Stan.At the beginning of "The Return of the Bling", Klaus proclaims he is ready to pretend to go to school if someone wants to pretend to see his bus outside. He has a Family Guy lunch box and is wearing a baseball cap with Brian Griffin on the front.The end of "The Unbrave One" had Quagmire as the mysterious Internet doctor, Dr. Vadgers, whom Francine kept emailing for results on her pregnancy.In "Gone With the Wind", Quagmire tells Cleveland that after he drops Loretta's coffin at the funeral home, he is heading to Langley Falls for a background gag in a bachelor party scene in American Dad!.In "Ain't Nothin' but Mutton Bustin'", Rallo has a belt buckle of Roger that he was looking to replace after winning his first mutton busting competition at the fair.Roger is shown on a stained glass window in "Jesus Walks".The Volume One release was retitled Season One for the Region 2 and 4 releases, however the subsequent releases retained the Volume titles.On the packaging for the Season 1 release on Region 2 DVD, there was no mention of audio commentaries or some of the bonus features whatsoever, leading many to (incorrectly) believe they had been omitted from the release.The Region 2 and 4 DVDs do not have censored audio tracks on any episodes, although Volume 3 has so called "uncensored tracks" on the set, which was probably an error from the transfer because the tracks are already automatically uncensored on the set.The Volume 4 DVD release blurb contained information on the episode "Phantom of the Telethon", which was instead featured on Volume 5.On Volume 6, despite claims of being uncensored, the bleeps from "Home Adrone", "My Morning Straitjacket", and "G-String Circus" are not removed.Animation DominationAmerican Dad! on Fox.comAmerican Dad! on AdultSwim.comAmerican Dad! on TBS.comAmerican Dad! at the Internet Movie DatabaseAmerican Dad! at the Big Cartoon DataBaseThe template Tv.com is being considered for deletion.Detroit 1-8-7 is an American police procedural series about Detroit's leading homicide unit, created by Jason Richman for ABC. It features an ensemble cast of actors including Michael Imperioli and James McDaniel. The series originally ran on ABC from September 21, 2010 to March 20, 2011.The show's executive producer, David Zabel stated, "This is a crime show but we will explore various nooks and crannies in the communities and within that context there's a lot of opportunity to see what's positive in the city and see what's heroic about the people fighting for whats best for the city of Detroit."[1]The 1-8-7 of the title is a specific reference to the California Penal Code designation for homicide, which has become a slang term for murder. The Michigan Penal Code designations for the various forms of homicide begin at 750.On May 13, 2011, Detroit 1-8-7 was canceled by ABC.[2] With the cancellation, series creator Jason Richman has said he is pursuing options for the series to continue on cable television, also stating that chances for the move are "slim".[3]The DVD set for the series was released on August 30, 2011.[4]The following characters appeared in several episodes:The following unnamed characters appeared in several episodes:On November 6, 2009 ABC picked up five new projects from Mandeville Films which included Detroit 1-8-7, at the time called "187 Detroit".[6] ABC ordered the pilot of Detroit 1-8-7 on January 4, 2010.[7] Jon Michael Hill was the first person cast for the show in late January.[8] Nellie Andreeva, then of The Hollywood Reporter, reported on January 27, 2010 that the lead role in Detroit 1-8-7 had been offered to British actor Jason Isaacs.[9] Aisha Hinds, Natalie Martinez, and D.J. Cotrona were all cast in February 2010.[10][11][12] It was announced on night of March 2, 2010 that Michael Imperioli joined the cast of Detroit 1-8-7.[13] Three days later it was announced that James McDaniel, Shaun Majumder, and Erin Cummings had been cast in the remaining principal roles of Detroit 1-8-7.[14] The character Detective Louis Fitch was originally named Joseph Fitch and the Wayne County Medical Examiner's name was Dr. Hailey Cork in the pilot.[15] The pilot was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia in March 2010.[16]On May 18, 2010 it was confirmed that ABC had picked up Detroit 1-8-7 for the 2010-11 TV season.[17] Although the pilot episode was shot in Atlanta, the series is filmed in Detroit.[1] Originally planned as a mockumentary, ABC decided to abandon the format after the Detroit Police Department suspended real-life documentary ridealongs by camera crews after a controversial police shooting during filming of the A&E documentary series The First 48.[18][19] The casting call for extras in Detroit was announced on June 18, 2010.[20] Production on the series began on July 20, 2010.[21] Scenes from the pilot were re-shot to remove the mockumentary format before the episode aired.[19]There was a controversy over a single word in the script of the premiere, "soda". The character Pooch, played by Mo McRae said, "You just drunk the last of my soda."[22] The next morning it was a recurring topic on local radio station WDZH (98.7 AMP) about which is the proper term for soft drink in Detroit, "soda" or "pop". The winner was "pop".[23] The character Pooch was also in the seventh episode and that time he asked for a "pop".[24] At the end of the season 1 finale, Detective Fitch asks his son if he would like to get a Coney and soda, to which his son replies that "they don't say soda here, they say pop...everyone knows that", as Detective Fitch nods and smiles.The score is composed by Dave Kushner and John O'Brien. Detroit 1-8-7 has been noted for its usage of Motown music in its episodes.[25] Motown music featured in Detroit 1-8-7 includes "Ball Of Confusion" by The Temptations, "Higher Ground" and "Living for the City" by Stevie Wonder. The ringtone on Detective Washington's phone in the first episode is "Baby Love" by The Supremes.[26]Episode 1: "Pilot"Episode 2: "Local Hero / Overboard"Episode 3: "Nobody's Home / Unknown Soldier"Episode 4: "Royal Bubbles / Needle Drop"Episode 5: "Murder in Greektown / High School Confidential"Episode 6: "Lost Child / Murder 101"Episode 7: "Broken Engagement / Trashman"Episode 8: "Deja Vu / All In"Episode 9: "Home Invasion / Drive-By"Episode 10: "Shelter"Episode 11: "Ice Man / Malibu"Episode 12: "Key to the City"Episode 13: "Road to Nowhere"Episode 14: "Beaten / Cover Letter"Episode 15: "Legacy / Drag City"Episode 16: "Stone Cold"Episode 17: "Motor City Blues"Episode 18: "Blackout"Detroit 1-8-7 premiered on September 21, 2010 at 10:00 PM on ABC.[27] The first season was initially to be 13 episodes. On October 25, 2010 ABC announced the order of an additional 5 episodes to bring the first season to 18 episodes.[28]The thirteenth episode, "Road To Nowhere", was initially scheduled for January 18, 2011 but was replaced with a 20/20 special interview with Mark E. Kelly, the husband of U.S. Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords who is believed to have been the intended target in the shooting near Tucson, Arizona ten days before.[29][30] The 2011 State of the Union Address was broadcast on January 25.[31] "Road To Nowhere" was broadcast on February 1, 2011.[29]On February 22, 2011 an episode of Primetime: What Would You Do was shown in place of the previously scheduled sixteenth episode, "Stone Cold".[32] A special 20/20 interview with Charlie Sheen was broadcast on March 1, 2011, again displacing "Stone Cold".[33] "Stone Cold" was eventually broadcast on March 8.[34] The rescheduling of previous episodes put the season finale in conflict with season 12 of Dancing with the Stars and as a result Detroit 1-8-7 was moved to Sunday, March 20 at 10:00 PM.[35]Detroit 1-8-7 has an average score of 63/100 on Metacritic based on 22 reviews from television critics.[36] Robert Bianco of USA Today describes the series as the best police drama on ABC since NYPD Blue ended. Bianco says the show's best trait is its uncommon setting and that it is filmed where it is set, "which gives it an authenticity and a palpable sense of place."[37] The New York Times's television critic Alessandra Stanley said the show is "a throwback to an earlier era of cop shows when steel-edged realism was still novel and there was a thrill to watching terse, streetwise detectives on shows like Dragnet and Kojak cajole witnesses and browbeat suspects."[26]Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found Detroit 1-8-7 brings nothing new to the police procedural genre but that it does offer strong performances from its cast. Owen further said that the drama is disappointingly generic, but expected it to appeal to die-hard fans of the genre.[38] In his review of new shows for autumn 2010 Hank Stuever of the Washington Post gives Detroit 1-8-7 a grade of D+ and says "nothing to see here."[39] John Doyle of The Globe and Mail called Detroit 1-8-7 "a too-conventional cop show."[40]Many critics point out that the ghost remnants of the show's original premise as a mockumentary can be found throughout the first episode.[37][38][41][42]James Poniewozik of Time Magazine said that "Detroit 1-8-7 does not look bad. It's more character-focused than a typical procedural and has a strong, multiethnic cast (including The Sopranos' Michael Imperioli). And it has a sense of the city's history: an African-American cop, referencing the city's white-flight past, says he's been on the force so long that "when I started, half of the suspects were white."[43]John Roach, former Detroit Police Department spokesman, in speaking of the first episode, said, "I think the show portrayed Detroit's police officers as real people, dedicated, even heroic, which is entirely deserved."[44]The premiere of Detroit 1-8-7 received 9.34 million viewers and 2.3/7 Adults 18-49 rating/share.[45] The twelfth episode, "Key To The City", recorded 5.05 million viewers and a series low 1.0/3 rating/share among adults 18 to 49 years old.[46] The following episode, "Road to Nowhere" was up to 5.6 million viewers [47] The series finale, "Blackout", marked a series low in viewers at 4.652 million, and a 1.1 in adults 18-49.[48] According to Nielsons, Detroit 1-8-7 has averaged 7.57 million viewers and rank #64.[49]Detroit 1-8-7 was nominated for Favorite New TV Drama at the 37th People's Choice Awards but it did not make the final cut for the five finalists. [50] [51] [52] The series was also nominated for Outstanding Drama Series at the 2011 NAACP Image Awards.[53][54] Detroit 1-8-7 was also nominated for a Golden Reel Award and a Banff Rockie Award.[55][56] Tom O'Neil of the Los Angeles Times has said that Detroit 1-8-7 is a possible contender for the Outstanding Drama Series Emmy and that Michael Imperioli is a possible nominee for an Outstanding Lead Actor Emmy.[57][58]Detroit 1-8-7 premiered on Fox Crime in Spain, where it is known simply as Detroit, on November 15, 2010.[59] On November 29, 2010 Variety reported that Canal+ has acquired rights to the series and will be showing it in France beginning on January 27, 2011.[60] Detroit 1-8-7 is shown on the national broadcast station RTE 2 in Ireland.[61] In India, STAR World India began broadcasting Detroit 1-8-7 on December 14, 2010.

The show was created by Nick Wauters, and premiered on NBC on September 20, 2010. The plot centers on a group of extraterrestrials, some of whom have been detained by the United States government for sixty-six years since their ship crashed in Alaska, while others have secretly assimilated among the general populace. The series was picked up for a full first season of 22 episodes on October 18, 2010.[1] NBC canceled the series on May 13, 2011.[2]Near the end of World War II, a craft of undetermined origin crashed in the Brooks Range of northern Alaska. It carried passengers who appeared outwardly human, but were eventually determined to be of extraterrestrial origin. Their DNA is slightly less than one percent different from humans, and they age at a much slower rate. Ninety-seven of the survivors were captured by the U.S. government and held in a secret facility nearby, Mount Inostranka, run by intelligence agencies, since they have refused to disclose much about their origin. The remaining survivors, also known as the Sleepers, who only sustained minor injuries, were able to escape the crash scene and currently live among the population.President Martinez learns of the facility's existence shortly after his inauguration and decides, after meeting the leader of the detainees, to release them and disclose their existence to the world over the objections of the intelligence agencies. His plans are put on hold when an assassination attempt on him is foiled by means beyond human technology. The CIA realizes there are other aliens and secretly plans to find and detain them. Unknown to the agency, the agent chosen to head the effort is himself an alien. The aliens are divided internally on how to respond to this.Caught in the middle of these events is Sean Walker, whose plans to propose to his girlfriend Leila on a Caribbean cruise are cut short when she mysteriously disappears from the ship. His investigation eventually leads him to uncover the assassination plot.The show's pilot episode is told almost entirely in retroversions to three different time frames. According to Nick Wauters, the show's creator, later episodes will use flashbacks more to develop the characters. "There will be big reveals and big clues in each episode," he said, promising that viewers will not have to wait too long for answers to questions raised.[3] After the pilot aired, he and executive producer Steve Stark answered some viewer questions on their Twitter feeds, for example explaining that the fate of the plane will be disclosed early in the next episode.[4] The characters also have Twitter feeds, and one has a blog, truthseeker5314.com, which may reveal additional information.[3] The last two episodes before[5] and all episodes following its hiatus no longer feature flashbacks. Cast member Blair Underwood said regarding the removal of the flashbacks, "We had been jumping around a lot and doing flashbacks and that was confusing to people," and "So when we come back, that device is done with! We are now telling the story straight through so people can track it and follow it easier."[6]Producer Steve Stark brought the original script to NBC in 2009, after hearing that the network was looking for "event-type" series to add to its television lineup.[19] The script was written by Nick Wauters in 2006.[19] The show appeared on NBC's development slate in early January 2010, when the network announced at the Television Critics Association presentation that it had green-lit production of a pilot episode.[20][21]Casting announcements began in early February, with Jason Ritter landing the lead role of Sean Walker.[22] In late February, eljko Ivanek was cast as Blake Sterling, a director at the CIA, and Ian Anthony Dale signed on as Simon Lee, a government operative.[23] This was followed a few days later by the addition of Scott Patterson and Sarah Roemer to the cast.[24] Roemer was cast as Sean's girlfriend, Leila Buchanan, with Patterson portraying her father, Michael. In late February, Laura Innes was cast as Sophia Maguire, the inmate leader at a mysterious prison facility, a role which was originally envisioned as male.[25][26] Blair Underwood came on board in early March in the role of President Eli Martinez, a role which was originally planned for a Hispanic actor.[27][28] Finally, the addition of Taylor Cole completed the main cast.[29]Jeffrey Reiner signed on to direct, after having agreed to a deal with Universal Media Studios to work on new projects.[30] He will also serve as an executive producer. After having read the pilot script, he called it a "page turner."[30] Lisa Zwerling, who also signed a deal with UMS, will serve as a consulting producer.[31]On May 7, 2010, NBC announced that it had given a series order for The Event,[32] followed by the announcement that Evan Katz was signed as showrunner and executive producer.[33][34] A week later the network announced that the series would appear on the Fall 2010 television schedule, airing on Mondays at 9 pm.[35] On October 18, 2010, NBC announced it ordered nine more episodes, adding to the original thirteen.[1]In mid-July 2010 Clifton Collins, Jr. was cast as Thomas, a character described as "a key player in the show's secret conspiracy".[36][37]The series is a thriller, love story, and mystery with an element of science fiction.[38] Unlike other well known series of the same genre, producers have promised timely answers to mysteries, with some answers provided as early as the upcoming episode.[38][39] Executive producer Evan Katz stated that "everything is designed to answer questions so you're not frustrated or feeling like we're making it up as we go along" and the writers intend to keep the viewers guessing in a "fair way."[39]The Event was one of four new series screened at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2010, with The Hollywood Reporter saying the crowd response suggested "NBC's fall drama The Event came up a big winner."[40][41]Reviews of the pilot episode were generally favorable, scoring 67 out of 100 on Metacritic[42] many invoking comparisons to Lost and 24, each of which had ended its run the preceding spring. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times called it "as big, brash and promising as Heroes was a few years back".[43] Variety's Brian Lowry called it "an enticing start".[44] Linda Stasi of the New York Post stated that "if 24, Lost, and The 4400 had a baby, it would be The Event".[45]More cautious commentators said the show had promise but could not go on tantalizing the audience with a proliferation of mysteries. "The effort required to follow the story" said Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter, "goes well beyond what most viewers might be willing to give."[46] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly called the pilot "an irritating tease" and hoped the second episode would answer some of the questions the pilot asked.[47]The pilot episode received 10.88 million viewers and a 3.6/9 adults 1849 rating/share, placing third in its timeslot at 9:00 pm ET.[48] After averaging 9.1 million viewers for the first four episodes, NBC picked up the series for a full season.[1]However, by the final episode of 2010 on November 29, the series had cut its audience by 46% and its demo rating by 48%, to 5.83 million and a 1.9/5 respectively,[49] although both of these were up noticeably from the previous week.[50] On November 15, NBC announced that The Event would be going into hiatus after the November 29 episode, and would return on February 28, 2011[51] (later pushed back to March 7).[52] Upon its return, the series received 5.23 million viewers and a then-series-low 1.4/4 1849 rating/share;[53] the latter of these figures represented a 26% plunge from the fall finale.[54] The series has since gone as low as 3.85 million viewers and a 1.1/3 rating/share in 1849, first on April 18[55] and again on May 9.[56]The complete series was released on DVD in region 1 on August 23, 2011[57] and in region 2 on October 17, 2011.[58] Special features on the DVD include seven behind-the-scenes featurettes, six audio commentaries with cast and crew, deleted scenes, episode recaps, a photo gallery, and a never-before-seen look at Dempsey's back story.[57]The Event has been syndicated for broadcast in several countries worldwide, including Canada where it aired simultaneously as the U.S.,[59] United Kingdom,[60] Sweden,[61] the Netherlands,[62] Russia,[63] Italy,[64] Ireland,[65] New Zealand,[66] Finland,[67] Belgium (Flanders),[68] and Israel.[69]After the series' cancellation, the Syfy channel had been rumored to be in talks to continue the series as a miniseries;[70] this was later denied by Syfy's Craig Engler.[71] At the 2011 Television Critics Association Tour, NBC chairman Robert Greenblatt revealed a possibility of a TV movie. He said, "It's been discussed with Syfy and a few weeks ago it seemed more possible than it does today, but I honestly don't know." If it were to happen, it would air on Syfy, and not NBC.[72]The Event at TV.comSerial dramaThrillerMysteryScience fictionJason RitterSarah RoemerLaura InnesIan Anthony DaleScott PattersonTaylor ColeLisa VidalBill SmitrovichClifton Collins, Jr.eljko IvanekBlair UnderwoodEvan KatzSteve StarkJeffrey ReinerUniversal Media StudiosSteve Stark Productions1 Synopsis

The series is produced by K/O Paper Products and 101st Street Television in association with CBS Productions. The title of the new show uses a zero in place of the letter "O" in the original title.[1]Hawaii Five-0 debuted on CBS, the same network that aired the original version. Like the original version, it follows an elite state police unit/task force set up to fight crime in the state of Hawaii. It premiered on Monday, September 20, 2010, 42 years to the day from the premiere of the original show, September 20, 1968. On October 21, 2010, CBS announced that Hawaii Five-0 had been given a full season order of 24 episodes.[2]On March 14, 2012, CBS renewed Hawaii Five-0 for a third season,[3] which premiered on September 24, 2012.[4]The series covers the actions of a small special state task force created by the Governor of Hawaii, Gov. Pat Jameson, to investigate serious crimes throughout the Islands, as Hawaii does not have a conventional state police force. The team is headed by Lieutenant Commander Steve McGarrett, USNR as it investigates crimes ranging from terrorism to kidnapping. McGarrett chooses as his partner Honolulu PD Detective Danny "Danno" Williams. He fills out the team by selecting Chin Ho Kelly, and Chin's cousin, a rookie HPD cop named Kono Kalakaua. The task force does not follow the normal chain of command and instead reports directly to the Governor's office. One unexplained part of the story concerns the name Five-0. Taken from a shirt worn by the young Steve McGarrett in a video that the team watches, Kono decides that Five-0 would be a good name for their task force. However, it is not explained how everyone (including tourists) seems to know what Five-0 is despite it being an unofficial name coined in a private meeting,[5][6] although the name appears to have been made official in later episodes. Five-0's headquarters are apparently located in Aliiolani Hale, site of a famous Kamehameha Statue, which features prominently in the series; in real life Aliiolani Hale serves as the central headquarters of the Hawai'i State Judiciary and where the Supreme Court of Hawaii regularly convenes.Each episode typically begins with a crime being committed or a body being discovered (although in one episode the team was assigned to provide protection for a foreign dignitary), and assignment of the subsequent criminal investigation to the unit by either the governor herself or her representative. The task force uses the authority of the governor's office to gain access to crime scenes and investigations involving the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) when they cross paths. To assist them in their investigations, the team is granted immunity from prosecution for actions committed in the line of duty, although this immunity is revoked by the lieutenant governor following the governor's assassination.A major character arc set up in the pilot episode revolves around the murder of McGarrett's father, who was working on a corruption case even after retiring from the HPD. After the terrorist responsible for his father's murder is apprehended, a mysterious figure interrogates him about Steve's investigation into his father's old cases. This figure is later revealed to be Wo Fat, a criminal with ties to the Japanese Yakuza, and is possibly connected to the suspected car-bomb murder of Steve's mother (a death originally ruled an accident). When his father investigated this as the head of the HPD Organized Crime Task Force, he began to dig too far into the corruption, forcing him to lay off the investigation. He nonetheless saved all his evidence in a toolbox, all of which was left to his son in the hope that he would someday conclude his father's work.Another character arc involves the reasons behind Chin Ho's departure from the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) after being accused of stealing cash from the HPD asset forfeiture locker. McGarrett accepts Chin Ho onto the task force, as he was his father's protg. As the series progresses, it is revealed that a mole within HPD framed Chin Ho for the theft, and that this mole was also possibly connected to McGarrett Sr.'s old corruption probe.In the season one finale, the Five-0 task force is disbanded after McGarrett is arrested for Governor Jameson's murder. However, in the second season, the new governor, Sam Denning, reinstates the task force after McGarrett is proven innocent; but the team no longer has absolute immunity and must follow the Governor's rules. Governor Denning appoints Lori Weston from the Department of Homeland Security to the Five-0 task force in episode 2 to monitor the team; she resigns after the task force is involved in a diplomatic incident at the Russian consulate.In season two, Masi Oka's Dr. Max Bergman, M.E., discovers his biological mother was the victim of a serial murderer who has started killing again. There was a cooling of relations between Rachel and Danny to the point, by the end of the season, where Danny was about to fight Rachel and her current husband Stan's plan to take Danny's daughter Grace with them on their move to the mainland. Kono is involved in an undercover assignment, for five episodes, where she appeared to have lost her badge, but was actually working HPD Internal Affairs Capt. Vincent Fryer, who was investigating a group of former cops engaged in illegal activities. Chin Ho and his former fiance reunite and marry, with the Five-0 task force and Kamekona as members of their wedding party.McGarrett continues to try to learn more about the death of his father and the mysterious Shelburne. His former SEAL Commander, Joe White (who was also a friend of McGarrett's father), arrives in the islands and appears to be helping McGarrett at times and getting in his way at others. Wo Fat returns and is involved in a series of murders, including the leader of the Yakuza, Hiro Noshimuri, and is being hunted down by them. At the end of the season, Joe takes McGarrett to see Shelburne in Japan; Shelburne turns out to be his mother, who was presumed dead for 20 years.[7]The idea to bring Hawaii Five-O back to television had been under consideration well before the 2010 version was announced. The first attempt was a one-hour pilot for a new series that was made in 1996 but never aired, although a few clips were found years later and are available online. Produced and written by Stephen J. Cannell, it was intended to star Gary Busey and Russell Wong as the new Five-0 team. Original cast member James MacArthur briefly returned as Dan Williams, this time as governor of Hawaii, with cameos made by other former Five-O regulars. Another attempt was made to turn the project into a film by Warner Bros. but that also was scrapped.[10]On August 12, 2008, CBS announced that it would bring Hawaii Five-O back to the network schedule for the 20092010 television season. The new version would be an updated present-day sequel, this time centering around Steve McGarrett, who succeeds his late father Steve (Jack Lord's character in the original series) as the head of the unit. Ed Bernero, executive producer and showrunner of Criminal Minds, was to helm the new take, which he described as "Hawaii Five-O, version 2.0". It was also to incorporate most of the iconic elements from the original, including the "Book 'em, Danno" catchphrase, into the remake. Bernero, who was a fan of the original, and had a ring tone of the series' theme song on his cell phone, had always wanted to bring the series back to TV.[11] This version did not go beyond the script stage.In October 2009, it was announced that Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci had signed on to script a pilot episode, and that Peter M. Lenkov would serve as the series showrunner.[12] Kurtzman and Orci decided to reboot the original concept similar to their work on the 2009 Star Trek film, rather than a sequel to the original series. Production on the pilot was shot in and around Honolulu from February to April 2010.On May 17, 2010, the Hawaii Five-O remake was picked up by CBS, which scheduled it for Monday nights in the 1011 pm timeslot.[13][14] The news was good for the state of Hawaii, which hopes that the remake will pump new life into the economy. Production of the remainder of the first season started in June 2010.[15][16] On June 24, 2010, the producers announced that it will use the warehouse at the former Honolulu Advertiser building as the official soundstage studio for the series starting in July 2010.[17] Exteriors representing Five-0 headquarters in the series are located at the Judiciary History Center of the Supreme Court Building in Honolulu, directly across the street from Iolani Palace, which represented Five-O headquarters in the original series.This revival series uses a zero as the last character in its title instead of the letter "O" that is used in the title of the original series. According to The Los Angeles Times, a CBS insider said that the disambiguation was necessary because of search engine results.[18] When Variety conducted its own search engine test on Google, it found that "Hawaii Five-0" (with the zero) had 263,000 results while "Hawaii Five-O" (with the letter O) had over 1.7 million.[19]On August 18, 2011, CBS announced that Hawaii Five-0 would cross over with NCIS: Los Angeles by having Daniela Ruah guest star as Kensi Blye from the latter series.[20] The crossover aired on October 24, 2011, in episode 6 of season 2. A two-part crossover was aired on the April 30, 2012 episode of Hawaii Five-0 and the May 1, 2012 episode of NCIS: Los Angeles, with two characters from each show visiting the other (Callen and Hanna from NCIS: Los Angeles and Danny and Chin Ho from Five-0).In February 2010, it was announced that Daniel Dae Kim had been cast to play Chin Ho Kelly, an ex-cop trained by Steve McGarrett's father. He was the first actor cast for the remake.[21] Several days later, Alex O'Loughlin was cast as Steve McGarrett,[22] the son of ex-cop John McGarrett (portrayed by William Sadler). The producers pay homage to the original series by making one of Steve's hobbies restoring his father's 1974 Mercury Marquis, which is in fact the actual car driven by Jack Lord in the latter half of the original series' run.[23] Actress Grace Park was later cast as rookie detective Kona "Kono" Kalakaua,[24] and Scott Caan was cast as Danny "Danno" Williams. In the recurring cast are Jean Smart as Governor Pat Jameson and Masi Oka as the medical examiner Max Bergman. Oka was upgraded to series regular for the second season.[25]Of note, several recurring roles have been filled by surviving members of the original cast. Al Harrington, who played Det. Ben Kokua in the original series, now plays a friend of McGarrett's, Mamo Kahike.[26] Dennis Chun, who had various guest roles in the original series and is the son of Kam Fong Chun (the actor that portrayed the original Chin Ho), has a recurring role as HPD Sgt. Duke Lukela in the remake.[27] James MacArthur, the last surviving main cast member from the original series, agreed to guest star in a first season episode; however, he died on October 28, 2010, before filming his appearance.[28]Larisa Oleynik was cast as Jessica Kaye[29] (changed to Jenna Kaye in the episode broadcast),[30] scheduled to join the Five-0 task force in the show's 19th episode.[31] Oleynik appeared on a recurring basis for the remainder of the 201011 season, with an option to become a regular in season 2;[32] however, her character was killed off in season 2, episode 10. It was also announced that Terry O'Quinn would be joining the cast of the show in season two,[33] along with Lauren German, who would play Lori Weston, a former Homeland Security (and FBI agent) official assigned by the new governor to keep an eye on the team.[34]For season three, Christine Lahti has been cast in a recurring role as Doris McGarrett, the thought-to-be-deceased mother of Steve McGarrett.[35] Also, Michelle Borth who plays Lt. Catherine Rollins will become main cast for season 3.Hawaii Five-0 uses the original show theme song composed by Morton Stevens. Critics received an early copy of the pilot with a synthesizer and guitar-based version of the theme. After negative reaction to the reworked song spread quickly online, Kurtzman said he and others realized that changing the music was a mistake, and arranged for studio musicians,[36] including three who had worked on the original from 1968,[37] to rerecord the theme "exactly as it was", except shortened to 30 seconds[36] from its original length of about 60 seconds.[38] Original instrumental music is composed by Brian Tyler and Keith Power.[39]Hawaii Five-0: Original Songs from the Television Series is a soundtrack album featuring music used in the CBS television series Hawaii Five-0. The first volume in the series received attention for how show producers integrated these new and previously unreleased tracks from major-name artists into the second season episodes. This method contrasted with the norm for TV soundtracks, which tend to be compilations of previously released music that is already available individually or on other albums. Hawaii Five-0: Original Songs from the Television Series was released on October 4, 2011, according to [1] Amazon.com.| "What Makes You Beautiful" || One Direction ||The series premiered in the U.S. on CBS on September 20, 2010. Canada's Global TV and NTV premiered the show at the same time as the United States premiere.[40] Hawaii Five-0 has been syndicated for broadcast in several countries worldwide, including Australia,[41] the United Kingdom,[42] France,[43] Germany,[44] Italy,[45][46] Japan,[47] Spain,[48] the Middle East,[49] the Netherlands,[50] and South Africa.[51]The show has received mostly positive reviews, scoring a 65 out of 100 aggregate score on Metacritic as of October 12, 2010.[2] On May 19, 2010, The Honolulu Advertiser offered an opinion about the new version: "A smart script, slick production values and maybe a splash of nostalgia got the remake of Hawaii Five-O placed on the CBS prime-time lineup this fall, but it will take more than beefcake and a remixed theme song to keep the show on the air." The piece also pointed out that times have changed since the original left the air, citing other shows that were set in Hawaii which have come and gone. It expressed a hope that the producers will succeed in bringing a new life to the title with this remake.[52] The show also has a large, hugely devoted fanbase, often called an "ohana". Hawaii Five-0 was also in the Guinness World Records 2012 for Highest-Rated New Show in the U.S. with a record 19.34 million viewers for its January 23, 2011 episode (Kai ee).[53]Series star Scott Caan was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Series, Miniseries or Television Film for his role as Danny on Hawaii Five-0. Hawaii Five-0 also won the "Favorite New TV Drama" at the 37th People's Choice Awards on January 5, 2011.Hawaii Five-0 made several positive effects on the state's economy since it began airing. Known as the "Five-0 Effect" by Hawaii News Now reporter Steve Uyehara, various Hawaii-based businesses saw an increase in sales after they were featured in episodes of the show. Visitor numbers to the USS Missouri Memorial Association, after being featured in some of the episodes, increased 25 percent, helping the site achieve a record year in 2010. Waiola Shave Ice, the business run by Kamekona on the show, saw a 20 percent increase in shave ice sales, along with a 30 percent rise in t-shirt sales. Kona Brewing Company also saw a 60 percent increase in sales after their beers were featured as McGarrett's favored alcoholic beverage in several episodes. In addition, residents from other states visit Hawaii based on viewing the series.[61]TNT has acquired the off network rights to air the series. Episodes will begin on the cable channel in 2014.[62]Hawaii Five-0 at TV.comPeter M.

"Steve" McGarrett, USNR, a former Navy SEAL with time spent in Office of Naval Intelligence. He is named after his grandfather, a USS Arizona casualty. McGarrett's father John is murdered in the pilot episode, and this forms the basis for the series' first story arc. (In Season 1 episode 4, "Lanakila", it was revealed that John McGarrett was born on March 15, 1942, and died September 20, 2010.) Steve McGarrett is both physically and intellectually capable, being able to speak Hawaiian and Chinese fluently while also being able to engage a person in hand to hand combat as well as utilizing fieldcraft when needed. McGarrett utilizes close quarters combat as his primary means of taking down suspects, something he was taught during SEAL training. He is an experienced Navy SEAL, as the governor once outlined his resume "Annapolis, five years Naval Intelligence, six years with the SEALs. Your superiors say that you are the best they have ever seen."Scott Caan as Detective Sergeant Daniel "Danny" (or "Danno") Williams, a Honolulu Police Department (HPD) detective, who transferred from the Newark Police Department when his ex-wife, Rachel, moved to Hawaii with their daughter Grace. Williams' "by-the-book" style contrasts with McGarrett's more impulsive "the ends justify the means" approach, and is a source of friction (and banter) between the two. Regarded as a haole for wearing a tie on the island during the first season, Williams is a loyal cop who is married to his job first and life second. As a consequence, he is often at odds with his ex-wife Rachel for sometimes not being on time. He is a loyal cop and friend, once refusing to believe that his former police partner was corrupt even when pitted against overwhelming evidence after the partner was found dead (season 1, episode 8).Daniel Dae Kim as Detective Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly, a former member of the HPD (reinstated in finale of season 1) and protg of McGarrett's father, who left the force after being falsely accused of corruption. It is later revealed that his uncle, a retired cop, took the money to pay for medical bills for his aunt. Despite insistence that he come clean, Kelly is willing to take the blame to prevent his uncle from going to jail. He is eventually cleared of the corruption charges and is reinstated to the HPD as a Lieutenant, but returns to the task force.Grace Park as Officer Kono Kalakaua, a recent HPD academy graduate and former professional surfer, who is also Chin Ho Kelly's cousin. She is detained and questioned by the HPD, having been accused of stealing $10 million from an HPD asset forfeiture locker. While on suspension, she helps Kelly and Williams go after Wo Fat, who was responsible for framing Steve McGarrett for the murder of the Governor. To the members of the Five-0 task force and to the general public, Kalakaua had been stripped of her badge by the Internal Affairs Department of the HPD, but it was later revealed to be a ploy for her to go undercover to bust a string of dirty ex-cops.Masi Oka as Dr. Max Bergman (Season 2present, season one recurring), an American-born Chief Medical Examiner. He also plays the piano and is a science fiction fan.Lauren German as Special Agent Lori Weston (Season 2 episodes 24 recurring, Season 2 episodes 516 main[8]), a former Homeland Security (and FBI) profiler assigned by the new governor to keep an eye on Five-0 to make sure they are following the rules. Weston resigns from Five-0 after an incident involving the Russian consulate in Honolulu.Michelle Borth as Lt. Catherine Rollins, USN, (Season 3present, season 12 recurring), an intelligence officer on the aircraft carrier Enterprise, and Steve McGarrett's on-and-off lover.Terry O'Quinn as Commander Joe White, USN, Steve McGarrett's mentor and Navy SEAL instructor.

Eugene KellyBoardwalk Empire is an American television series from cable network HBO, set in Atlantic City, New Jersey during the Prohibition era. It stars Steve Buscemi as Nucky Thompson. The show was adapted by Emmy Award-winning screenwriter and producer Terence Winter (of The Sopranos[2]) from a book about historical criminal kingpin Enoch L. Johnson by Nelson Johnson, titled Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City.[3]The pilot episode, directed by Martin Scorsese, was produced at a cost of $18 million.[4] On September 1, 2009, HBO picked up the series for an additional 11 episodes.[5] It premiered on September 19, 2010,[6] and has completed its second season. The series was renewed for a third season,[7] which premiered on September 16, 2012.[8] On Oct. 2, 2012, HBO announced that the series was renewed for a fourth season.[9]Boardwalk Empire has received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its visual style and basis on historical figures, as well as for Buscemi's lead performance.[10] The series has won twelve Emmy Awards and has received 30 nominations, including two for Outstanding Drama Series. The series also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series  Drama.Boardwalk Empire is a period drama focusing on Enoch "Nucky" Thompson (based on the historical Enoch L. Johnson),[11] a political figure who rose to prominence and controlled Atlantic City, New Jersey, during the Prohibition period of the 1920s and 1930s. Nucky interacts with several historical figures in both his personal and political life, including mobsters, politicians, government agents, and the common folk who look up to him. The federal government also takes an interest in the bootlegging and other illegal activities in the area, sending agents to investigate possible mob connections but also looking at Nucky's lifestyleexpensive and lavish for a county political figure.Emmy Award-winner Terence Winter, who served as executive producer and writer on the critically acclaimed HBO series The Sopranos, was hired to adapt the non-fiction book Boardwalk Empire on June 4, 2008.[14] Winter had already been interested in creating a series set in the 1920s, feeling that it had never properly been explored before. For this reason he decided to focus his adaptation of the book on the section about Prohibition.[15] On September 1, 2009, it was announced that Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese would direct the pilot.[16] It would be the first time he had directed an episode of television since an episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories in 1986.[17] The production would be very ambitious, with some even speculating it would be too large scale for television. "I kept thinking, 'This is pointless. How can we possibly afford a boardwalk, or an empire?'" says creator Terence Winter. "We can't call it 'Boardwalk Empire' and not see a boardwalk."[18] The production would eventually build a 300-foot-long (91m) boardwalk in an empty lot in Brooklyn, New York, at the cost of $5 million.[19] Despite a reported budget of up to $50 million,[20] the pilot's final budget came in at $18 million.[18]On why he chose to return to television, Scorsese said "What's happening the past nine to 10 years, particularly at HBO, is what we had hoped for in the mid-'60s with films being made for television at first. We'd hoped there would be this kind of freedom and also the ability to create another world and create long-form characters and story. That didn't happen in the 1970s, 1980s and in the 1990s I think. And of course ... HBO is a trailblazer in this. I've been tempted over the years to be involved with them because of the nature of long-form and their development of character and plot."[21] He went on to praise network HBO by saying, "A number of the episodes, in so many of their series, they're thoughtful, intelligent [and] brilliantly put together ... It's a new opportunity for storytelling. It's very different from television of the past."[22]"Scorsese is an actor magnet," commented Winter. "Everybody wants to work with him. I had all these pictures on my wall and I thought, 'I'd really better write some good stuff for these people.'"[18] In casting the role of Nucky Thompson (based upon real-life Atlantic City political boss Enoch L. Johnson), Winter wanted to stray from the real life Johnson as much as possible. "If we were going to cast accurately what the real Nucky looked like, we'd have cast Jim Gandolfini."[18] The idea of casting Steve Buscemi in the lead role came about when Scorsese mentioned wanting to work with the actor, whom Winter knew well having worked with him on The Sopranos. Winter sent the script out to Buscemi, who responded very enthusiastically. "I just thought, 'Wow. I'm almost sorry I've read this, because if I don't get it, I'm going to be so sad.' My response was 'Terry, I know you're looking at other actors'... and he said, 'No, no, Steve, I said we want you.'"[23] Explained Scorsese, "I love the range he has, his dramatic sense, but also his sense of humor."[23]The casting of Buscemi was soon followed by Michael Pitt, best known for his roles in films such as Murder by Numbers, The Dreamers, and in the television series Dawson's Creek.[24] He was soon joined by Kelly Macdonald, Vincent Piazza and Michael Shannon, who had just received an Oscar nomination for his role in the Sam Mendes film Revolutionary Road.[25]Filming for the pilot took place at various locations in and around New York City in June 2009.[26][27] In creating the visual effects for the series, the company turned to Brooklyn-based effects company Brainstorm Digital. Says Glenn Allen, visual effects producer for Boardwalk Empire and co-founder of Brainstorm, "It's our most complex job to date. Everything is HD now, so we have to treat it like a feature film."[28] "Anytime you get to work on a period piece, it's more fun," comments visual effects artist Chris "Pinkus" Wesselman, who used archival photographs, postcards, and architectural plans to recreate the Atlantic City boardwalks as accurately as possible. "We got to explore what the old Atlantic City was really like. The piers were one of the toughest parts because every summer they would changenew houses, new advertisements."[28] It took two months for the firm to complete all the visual effects for the pilot.[28] Boardwalk Empire began filming on location at Historic Richmond Town on Staten Island in March 2012.[29]Designed by John Dunn and tailored by Martin Greenfield, Boardwalk Empire's costumes were based on 1920s tailoring books from the Fashion Institute of Technology's research libraries and examples found at the Brooklyn Museum and the Met. The costumes have also been rented from the Daybreak Vintage Company located in Albany, NY which also exhibits at the Manhattan Vintage Clothing Show. Dunn's designs were meticulously detailed, including a collar pin for Nucky's shirts and even going so far as to incorporate specially ordered woolens for suiting. Dunn told Esquire magazine in a September 2010 interview, "With Marty and Terry Winters, I developed the feel for each of the characters. We all wanted it to be very, very accurate and specific to the period.... I don't like to do boring clothing, but you also have to make sure that you're not suddenly putting somebody in something that isn't going to make sense four episodes from now."[30] These tailors were supplied by textile importer HMS fabrics and Gladson ltd.Martin Scorsese was involved in the filming even before creator Terence Winter. He directed the pilot and established the look of the show, which other directors later emulated for consistency. He is also one of the executive producers of the show. Winter has stated that Scorsese weighs in on the casting decisions, watches all the cuts and dailies. Up until the shooting of the show's first season, Scorsese and Winter would meet every Sunday afternoon to review what went on during the week where Scorsese would have comments and suggestions. Martin Scorsese is expected to continue to be creatively involved in the ongoing production and if the series continueswith proper schedulinghe would like to direct more episodes.[31][32]Scorsese and Winter are joined as executive producers by Mark Wahlberg, Stephen Levinson and Tim Van Patten. Van Patten had been a regular director on The Sopranos and also served as a regular director for Boardwalk Empire. Lawrence Konner was a co-executive producer. Konner also wrote for the show and had previously been a writer on The Sopranos. Howard Korder and Margaret Nagle served as supervising producers and writers for the first season. The crew were recognized with multiple Emmy Award nominations for their work on the first season.[citation needed] Korder returned as a co-executive producer and writer for the show's second season and as an executive producer in Season Three.The music used for the opening titles is "Straight Up and Down" by The Brian Jonestown Massacre. It was chosen by series creator Winter to create a sense of the "unexpected".[1]The soundtrack is composed of music from the 1890s to 1920s performed by artists such as Regina Spektor, Leon Redbone, Loudon Wainwright III, Martha Wainwright, Catherine Russell, Nellie McKay, and Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks Orchestra. Boardwalk Empire Volume 1: Music From the HBO Original Series, featuring music from seasons 1 and 2, was released on September 13, 2011.[33]The soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 54th Grammy Awards.[34]Since debuting, Boardwalk Empire has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season scored 88/100[35] and the second season scored 81/100,[36] both indicating "universal acclaim."[35] For its first and second seasons, The American Film Institute named Boardwalk Empire one of the ten "best television programs of the year".[37][38]David Hinkley of the New York Daily News awarded the series five stars, saying, "Watching HBO's new 'Boardwalk Empire' is like sitting in your favorite tavern and hearing someone say, 'Drinks are on the house.' Friends, it does not get much better."[39] Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun-Times called it "... an event not to be missed," and praised Buscemi in particular, calling his performance "fascinating."[10]TV Guide's Matt Roush praised the partnership of Scorsese and Winter, saying it "... brilliantly marries Martin Scorsese's virtuosic cinematic eye to Terence Winter's panoramic mastery of rich character and eventful story," and finished his review by stating, "It's the most purelyand impurelyenjoyable storytelling HBO has delivered in ages, like a movie that you never want to end."[40]Variety's Brian Lowry praised the show for returning network HBO to top form, saying, "This is, quite simply, television at its finest, occupying a sweet spot thatfor all the able competitionstill remains unique to HBO: An expensive, explicit, character-driven program, tackling material no broadcast network or movie studio would dare touch ... For those wondering when the channel would deliver another franchise to definitively put it on top of the world, Ma, the wait is over: Go directly to 'Boardwalk.'"[18]"One of the unexpected joys of 'Boardwalk Empire,' though, lies in the way the show revels in the oddities of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a giddy shadow world of criminals and politicians collaborating to keep the liquor flowing," says online magazine Salon's Heather Havrilesky, who went on to call the pilot "breathtaking."[41] Roberto Bianco from USA Today said in his review that Boardwalk Empire was "Extravagantly produced, shockingly violent and as cold and hard as ice, Boardwalk Empire brings us back to the world's former playground at the start of Prohibitionand brings HBO back to the forefront of the TV-series race."[42]The second season received widespread acclaim. Verne Gay from Newsday stated that "Mad Men, of course, remains the King of the Emmys, while 'Empire' nailed the equally prestigious Golden Globe for best drama last winter. But Sunday begins to build the case for 'Empire,' and build it convincingly."[43] Matt Roush of TV Guide stated "This is a gorgeous piece of storytelling that requires and rewards patience."[44] Brian Lowry stated in his review for Variety that: "A few creative flourishes feel a trifle heavy-handed  starting with Shannon's philandering fed. Unlike Nucky, though, 'Boardwalk' isn't campaigning for anything except the gratitude of a pay-cable audience (and award voters) eager to take refuge in its sordid charms. By that measure, the show doesn't just go down smoothly; it's good to the last illicit, intoxicating drop."[45]On July 14, 2011, Boardwalk Empire was nominated for 18 Emmy Awards that included Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Steve Buscemi) and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Kelly Macdonald).[46] Boardwalk Empire won a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Writing in a New Series and was nominated for Best Writing in a Drama Series.[47] In addition, the show won a Golden Globe for best Dramatic Series, Buscemi won Best Actor in Dramatic Series and MacDonald was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television. The cast won the Screen Actor's Guild Award for Best Ensemble in a Drama Series, while Steve Buscemi won the Screen Actor's Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series and Martin Scorsese won the Directors Guild Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Series. Boardwalk Empire was in The American Film Institute's Top Ten List for TV in 2010.Boardwalk Empire also won two awards at the 9th Annual Visual Effects Society Awards. The first for "Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Broadcast Program" and second for "Outstanding Models & Miniatures in a Broadcast Program or Commercial". The former was received by Richard Friedlander (of Brainstorm Digital), Robert Stromberg, Paul Graff and David Taritero; the latter was received by Brendan Fitzgerald, John Corbett and Matthew Conner of Brainstorm Digital.[48] The show's Season One Soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media in 2012.On its original airing, the pilot episode gained a 2.0/5 ratings share among adults aged 1849 and garnered 4.81 million viewers.[49] The episode was re-played twice that night, once at 10:15p.m. and again at 11:30p.m. Taking these broadcasts into account, a total of 7.1 million Americans viewed the episode on the night of its original broadcast, and is the highest rated premiere for an HBO series since the pilot of Deadwood in March, 2004. The season finale was watched by 3.29 million viewers, attaining a 1.3 adults 1849 rating.[50]The second season premiere was watched by 2.91 million viewers, down 39% from the pilot and down 12% from its first season finale.[51]To promote the second season, which started on September 25, 2011, the producers paid the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York $150,000 to decorate and operate a New York Transit Museum train of four Low Voltage cars for each weekend in September 2011. The subway cars used were 5290, 5292 (both built in 1917), 5443, 5483 (both built in 1924). The train operated between noon and 6 p.m. and as an express between 96th Street and 42nd Street-Times Square on the IRT Broadway - Seventh Avenue Line. While the MTA runs "nostalgia trains" each year, this was the first time they had been used for an advertising tie-in.[52]HBO also sponsored an Atlantic City beautification project with the tag line "Compliments of Nucky Thompson" and paid for eastbound tolls into Atlantic City on the AC Expressway for the weekend of September 24, 2011.[52]Boardwalk Empire at TV.com1 Series overview2 Cast and characters

After watching the presentations and tasting the dishes, the judges chose 9 contestants (Alex, Fran, Greg and Krystal, Jamawn, Joseph, Marisa, Sandy, Stephenie, and Sudhir) to compete for the opportunity to have their concept opened as a restaurant in three locations.The contestants must create a logo for their company and hire a chef. The challenge this week includes serving a dish to 1000 people at Universal CityWalk Hollywood. Each person who samples the contestants dishes is given a silver coin to put into a contestant's jar. The contestant with the most coins is the winner and safe from elimination.Winner: Eric, for acquiring the most silver coins from the 1000 tasters.The nine remaining contestants must work the busy lunch shift at Chipotle Mexican Grill. All but Meltworks and Saucy Balls are directed to change their name and all must come up with a slogan. All but Stephenie (Compleat) do so. For the food evaluation, a signature dish based on the slogan is to be made. Sudhir and Marisa are advised to consider firing their chefs. Sudhir fires his chef and takes over as head chef while hiring a sous chef. Marisa stays with her chef. The evaluators included some of the country's top advertising executives. Flay recommends to Eric that he come up with some dipping sauces for the grilled cheese sandwiches.Winner: Jamawn, for acquiring the most silver coins from evaluators.The eight remaining contestants must design and construct a smaller design of their proposed eatery and menu board. They then unveil their own mini-design and meal for Dine Los Angeles event attendees. Stephenie changes her restaurant name to Harvest Sol. Eric does not follow Flay's last episode's recommendations to make dipping sauces.Winner: Sudhir, for acquiring the most silver coins from evaluators.The seven remaining contestants must design a uniform for their proposed eatery and do a photo shoot with the uniform. For the food challenge, the investors will propose a dish not yet made either on the menu or might fill a gap on the menu. Flay pushes the sauce idea on Eric again which he does this time, but not to Flay's liking.Winner: Greg and Krystal, for acquiring the most silver coins from evaluators.The six remaining contestants must design a truck and sell their food to pedestrians at one of two locations. With a $300 budget, the task was to figure out their food cost, set their prices, and make the most profit they can. Joey finally changes his restaurant name to Brooklyn Meatball Company. Sudhir takes Ells's advice to have a taco on the menu. Sandy fires her chef, based on the investors' advice.Winner: Jamawn, although no contestant made a profit, Jamawn took in the most money.The five remaining contestants must make food appropriate for children, also develop a toy for their restaurant. Stone and Garcia make an initial test of the food for the contestants, so they can tweak before the evaluation to make them more healthy or less spicy. Grill'billies argue with their cook and later lose half their food in a spill. Families were the tasters, including Flay's daughter.Winner: Joey, for having the most coins from the kids; he had 52% of the votes.The four remaining contestants head to Las Vegas as to test their concept somewhere other than Los Angeles. They are put up in a luxury suite at Caesar's Palace, whose guests will be the testers. Penn & Teller show up as testers. The contestants will be serve three dishes for the crowd. For the business challenge, the contestants will be hire their next two employees, who will handle the first hour of serving without the contestants' help. Stephenie's staff is unable to identify the dishes as they spend more time prepping. She also adds back lamb to an item after researching the treatment of lamb in America.Winner: Jamawn, for getting the most coinsThe remaining three contestants are to build a mini-restaurant in the former restaurant row area.[18] The mini-restaurants are to mimic a soft opening. Although the judges agree that Spice Coast's food is good, they feel that Sudhir has imitated the Chipotle Mexican Grill concept too much in the number of Tex-Mex style items he has added to his menu. The customers and judges also feel Brooklyn Meatball Company's food is excellent, but they must wait too long for it, as that restaurant's problem organizing legible tickets leads to a backup. Soul Daddy's food is also a success, though Bobby Flay is disappointed that Jamawn has replaced his fried chicken with baked chicken in order to provide a more healthy menu choice, and Lorena Garcia feels his food is too rich to eat more than once a week. This episode was preempted in the Pacific Time Zone due to coverage of the death of Osama bin Laden.Winner: Soul DaddyANGR Holdings is the company that ran Soul Daddy's restaurants.[23] It also holds registered trademarks on several of the other restaurant concepts' names (marked  below).[24] The Minneapolis Soul Daddy was housed in the Mall of America, while the Manhattan location was at the South Street Seaport,[18] at 189 Front Street.[25] The Los Angeles restaurant was located at Hollywood and Highland, in the same grand center as the Kodak Theater.[18] On June 14, 2011, the Manhattan and Los Angeles locations were closed in order for Woods to focus on the Minneapolis locations,[26][27] but that location later closed on June 28.[28] Woods has been vocal in blaming Chipotle's management team for the failure of the Soul Daddy chain.

He is best known as the head writer and executive producer of the television series Seinfeld, from 1989 to 1996, and as its co-creator, with Jerry Seinfeld himself. David has subsequently gained further recognition for the HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm, a mostly improvised sitcom, also created by David, in which he stars as a semi-fictionalized version of himself.[2]David's work won him a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993. Formerly a standup comedian, David went into television comedy, writing and starring in ABC's Fridays, as well as writing briefly for Saturday Night Live. He has won two Primetime Emmy Awards as well as being voted by fellow comedians and comedy insiders as number 23 of the greatest comedy stars ever in a British poll to select The Comedian's Comedian.[3]Lawrence Gene David[4] was born to a Jewish family in the neighborhood of Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Sheepshead Bay High School and then the University of Maryland, with a bachelor's degree in history (1969), and then in business (1970).[5] After college, David enlisted in the Army National Guard.[6]While a stand-up comedian, David also worked as a store clerk, limousine driver, and television repairman to pay his bills. He lived in Manhattan Plaza, a federally-subsidized housing complex in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, across the hall from Kenny Kramer, the inspiration for the Cosmo Kramer character in Seinfeld.[7] David then became a writer for and cast member of ABC's Fridays from 1980 to 1982, and a writer for NBC's Saturday Night Live (SNL) from 1984 to 1985.[8] During his time at Saturday Night Live, he was able to get only one sketch on the show, which aired at 12:50 AM, the last time slot on the show.[9]David quit his writing job at SNL midseason, only to show up to work a few days later acting as though nothing had happened. That plot inspired a second-season episode of Seinfeld entitled "The Revenge".[10] David met his future Seinfeld stars during that early stage of his career: He worked with Michael Richards (Kramer) on Fridays[8] and with Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Elaine)[9] on SNL.[11][12] He can be heard heckling Michael McKean when McKean hosted SNL in 1984, and he can be seen in the sketch "The Run, Throw, and Catch Like a Girl Olympics" when Howard Cosell hosted the season finale in 1985.[13]In 1989, David teamed up with comedian Jerry Seinfeld to create a pilot for NBC called The Seinfeld Chronicles, which became the basis for Seinfeld, one of the most successful shows in United States television history,[14] reaching the top on TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest TV shows of all time. Entertainment Weekly ranked it the third-best TV show of all time. David made occasional uncredited appearances on the show, playing such roles as Frank Costanza's cape-wearing lawyer and the voice of George Steinbrenner. He was also the primary inspiration for the show's character George Costanza.[15] David left Seinfeld on amicable terms after the seventh season but returned to write the series finale in 1998, two years later.[16] He also continued to provide the voice for the Steinbrenner character.[17]David wrote 62 of the episodes of Seinfeld, including 1992's "The Contest", for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award and which TV Guide ranked the episode #1 on its list of "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time".[18] Syndication of Seinfeld earned David an estimated US$250 million in 1998 alone. This amount has been steadily decreasing each year, but payments will continue until the full $1.7 billion from the original deal has been paid. In 2008 David made $55 million from Seinfeld syndication, DVD sales, and Curb Your Enthusiasm.[19][20] He was nominated for an Emmy[21] award 19 times for Seinfeld, winning twice  once for best comedy and once for writing.[22]The HBO cable television channel aired David's 1-hour special, Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, on October 17, 1999.[23] This was followed by Curb Your Enthusiasm, a television series on HBO that aired its first episode on October 15, 2000.[23] The show revisits many of the themes of Seinfeld,[24] and is improvised from a story outline only several pages long that David writes (as of the 5th season, additional writers were hired).[25]The actors improvise their dialogue based on the story outline, direction, and their own creativity. David has said that his character in the show, a fictionalized version of himself, is what he would be like in real life if he lacked social awareness and sensitivity.[26] The character's numerous and frequent social faux pas, misunderstandings, and ironic coincidences are the basis of much of the show's comedy and have led to the entry into the American pop culture lexicon of the expression "Larry David moment", meaning an inadvertently created socially awkward situation.[27]The basis of the show is the events in David's life following the fortune he earned from the Seinfeld series; David, semi-retired, strives to live a fulfilled life.[28] Alongside David is his wife Cheryl (played by Cheryl Hines), his manager and best friend Jeff (played by Jeff Garlin), and Jeff's wife Susie (played by Susie Essman). Celebrities, including comedians Bob Einstein, Wanda Sykes, and Richard Lewis, appear on the show regularly. Actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen have had recurring roles as themselves.[28]The show is critically acclaimed and has been nominated for 30 Primetime Emmy Awards, with one win, as well as one Golden Globe win. In the first six seasons, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Jason Alexander appeared in several episodes, and Jerry Seinfeld made a cameo. In season 7, the cast of Seinfeld, including Michael Richards, returned in a story arc involving David's attempt to organize a Seinfeld reunion special.On Wednesday, June 2, 2010, the series premiered on the TV Guide Network, making its network television debut. TV Guide Network also produced a series of related discussions with high-profile guest stars, media pundits, and prominent social figures called "Curb: The Discussion" debating the moral implications depicted in each episode. David is quoted as saying "Finally, thanks to the TV Guide Network, I'll get a chance to watch actual, intelligent people discuss and debate the issues addressed on 'Curb'. Now if only someone could tell me where this alleged 'Network' is, I might even watch it." [29]David has also been involved in other films and television series. David wrote and directed the 1998 film Sour Grapes, about two cousins who feud over a casino jackpot.[23] It was neither a commercial nor a critical success.[30][31] He has appeared in minor parts in two Woody Allen films Radio Days and New York Stories[32] more recently taking the leading role in Allen's New York-based comedy film Whatever Works.[33] Because his daughters are Hannah Montana fans, David, along with his daughters, guest-starred, as themselves, in the episode "My Best Friend's Boyfriend," in which they were waiting for a table at a fancy restaurant.[23] David had a cameo appearance on the HBO series Entourage as a client of Ari Gold, and also appeared as a panelist on the NBC series The Marriage Ref.During the 2008 U.S Presidential Election, David supported and actively campaigned for Barack Obama.In December 2010, David penned an op-ed piece for The New York Times, a sardonic critique of the extension of Bush-era tax cuts headlined "Thanks for the Tax Cut!"[34][35]On May 3, 2011, it was reported that he had signed on to play Sister Mary-Mengele in the 2012 reboot of The Three Stooges.[36][37]David co-wrote and starred in the upcoming HBO television film Clear History.David married Laurie Lennard on March 31, 1993. They have two daughters, and lived in Pacific Palisades, California.[38] Both Davids became contributing bloggers at The Huffington Post in May 2005.[39][40] On June 5, 2007, the couple announced their intention to amicably separate.[41] Laurie David filed for divorce on July 13, 2007, citing irreconcilable differences and seeking joint custody of the couple's two daughters.[42]The results of a DNA test shown live on Lopez Tonight in 2009 revealed that 37% of David's ethnic lineage might be Native American.[43] However, the test's accuracy is disputed by several genealogists.[44]1 Early life2 Career

It is a spin-off from the mystery series Murder, She Wrote.The series stars Jerry Orbach as a loudmouthed, uncouth private detective who continually finds himself solving mysteries on behalf of the prim and proper attorney (played by Barbara Babcock), who has an office across the hall. The attorney, Ellie Maginnis, finds McGraw's methods somewhat hard to digest, albeit effective, and a romantic attraction between the two is suggested although the series didn't last long enough for such a subplot to fully develop.This is a list of The Law & Harry McGraw episodes, in the order that they originally aired on CBS.After the show's fast cancellation (it lasted a little more than a half-season), Orbach reprised the role of Harry McGraw in a few episodes of Murder, She Wrote before a few years later moving on to play Lennie Briscoe on fellow Universal series Law & Order.1 Plot2 Cast3 Episodes4 Cancellation5 External linksJerry Orbach as Harry McGrawBarbara Babcock as Ellie MaginnisEarl Boen as HowardJuliana Donald as E.J.

She is the founder and CEO of Millionaire's Club International Inc., a professional matchmaking service for millionaires.Adopted into a Jewish family,[1] Patti Stanger grew up in Short Hills, New Jersey and graduated from Millburn High School.[2] She now lives in Los Angeles, CA.[3] She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Miami in 1983.Prior to founding her business, Stanger worked as the Director of Marketing for Great Expectations. Stanger is a third-generation matchmaker. Stanger was introduced to the fashion industry by Janis Spindel, who had hired and scouted her at the age of 24 when looking to cast a part for a sitcom pilot.[4] She worked for ten years in the fashion industry at Unionbay Sportswear, JouJou Jeans, and Saks Fifth Avenue.[5]In 2000, Stanger stated that "successful men in the dating arena needed a private, exclusive club where they could come to find their beautiful and intelligent wives."[citation needed]In 2008, Stanger signed a deal to have her own reality show called Millionaire Matchmaker on the Bravo TV Network. Stanger stars in the program and also produces the show.[6]The hour-long show follows her matchmaking at Millionaire's Club. Each episode features her matchmaking two millionaires. First, millionaire clients submit a biographical video profile on a DVD describing the type of partner they want. Stanger then meets them individually to better understand their desires and welcome them to the club. She's been called "The Simon Cowell of Dating",[7] and makes very quick, very direct comments. "I am not paid to hide my true feelings," she said. Her "casting calls" or "recruiting sessions", where she screens women, can be brutal. She told one woman she had a beautiful face but could not meet her millionaire because she was 1015lbs overweight. "I can't do much for women over 45," Stanger said in an interview, "and if they're overweight, it's almost impossible."[8] She told another woman to take off her wig, then suggested she come back after she got hair extensions.The millionaires and 3040 potential dates first meet at a cocktail party Stanger hosts called a "VIP mixer", where they mingle and the millionaires get to evaluate the candidates. The millionaires choose their top two candidates and have ten-minute "mini dates", after which they pick the one they like best. Stanger announces the choices to the group, and then the millionaires set up their "master dates".The Millionaire's Club has a few rules. For example, millionaires cannot discuss sex or trade phone numbers at the mixer. No sex is allowed until the couple is in an "exclusive, committed, monogamous relationship". There is also a two-drink maximum enforced on each date. If a millionaire violates the terms of the club, then Patti can throw him or her out of the club.At the end of each episode, Stanger calls each millionaire or invites him or her into her office to discuss how the date went; this is after she calls the person they chose for their master date.The show concludes with updates on each couple, indicating whether they are still together or not.In April 2009, Patti Stanger was hired by Clear Channel subsidiary Premiere Radio Networks to host a 4-week special titled P.S. I Love You for XM Satellite Radio.[9] The live call-in program was simulcast on Clear Channel owned MIX channel 22 and The Pink Channel on channel 24 Sunday evenings. After a month's hiatus, the program was returned to the schedule on a semi-regular basis, until it was moved to Thursday evenings in July 2009 and made a permanent fixture.[10] Stanger continues to host P.S. I Love You on Thursday nights from 4 PM to 6 PM Pacific time on both Mix and The Pink Channel.In 2003, Stanger started dating Andy Friedman, a real-estate executive whom she met through a matchmaker.[11] On July 22, 2009, Lalate.com announced that Andy proposed to Patti Stanger on May 31, her birthday. They did not agree on a date for the wedding, although episodes of season three of The Millionaire Matchmaker showed Stanger engaged in wedding planning activities and she spoke openly to the media about details of the wedding.[12]On August 14, 2010, Stanger announced via Twitter[13] that she was ending her relationship with Friedman, stating, "I just ended my relationship with Andy. It hit me really hard that I want kids in my life. You have to agree on the non-negotiables." She has also stated in the season 5 finale of Millionaire Matchmaker that Friedman was like a "best friend" to her and that passion was lacking in their relationship.After she was matched on her own show, she started seeing John Matthews, the man she picked[14]. In the Millionaire Matchmaker Reunion show however, she stated that the two of them were just friends.Stanger's first book on dating was published in 2009. It is entitled Become Your Own Matchmaker: 8 Easy Steps for Attracting Your Perfect Mate.[15]In February 2012, she was one of a group of celebrities who walked a catwalk in red dresses for the "Heart Truth Red Dress Collection" show, part of New York Fashion Week. She wore a Marc Bouwer dress. [16]On September 25, 2011, during a taping of Watch What Happens Live, hosted by Andy Cohen, Stanger made some remarks that many found controversial. When responding to a question from a gay man about a long-distance open relationship, she said, "There is no curbing you people", meaning that gay men are incapable of monogamy. She later told a viewer who Skyped in, "You are very handsome, I thought you were straight." She went on to explain that she meant he was not "queen-y". Stanger also made comments about Jewish men and smart women that were deemed offensive.[by whom?][17]These comments quickly drew many angry responses on Twitter. Bravo and Stanger issued apologies with Stanger tweeting, "I am so sorry. I did not mean to offend anyone with my comments last night on Watch What Happens Live.[18]1 Early life and education2 Career

The series was created by Dan Schneider and follows teenager Carly Shay and her best friends Sam Puckett and Freddie Benson as they create and star in their own web show.The show focuses on a girl named Carly Shay who creates her own web show called iCarly with her best friends Sam and Freddie. It stars Miranda Cosgrove as Carly, Jennette McCurdy as Sam, Nathan Kress as Freddie, Jerry Trainor as Spencer, and Noah Munck as Gibby. The show was taped at Nickelodeon on Sunset (season 15) and KTLA Studios (Season 6-7) in Hollywood, California. The show was originally rated TV-Y7, and later changed to TV-G.On May 17, 2012, it was announced that the show's seventh season was the last for iCarly and that a series finale event would air in November 2012.[1] The series finale, "iGoodbye" aired on November 23, 2012.iCarly is the fourth series created by Dan Schneider for Nickelodeon (the other three are The Amanda Show, Drake & Josh, and Zoey 101). During the development for iCarly, Schneider originally wanted to make a new TV series starring Miranda Cosgrove; the original idea was that she play a normal girl who, in a twist of fate, gets cast to star in her favorite TV show, Starstruck. The pilot was written (and turned in to Nickelodeon), which was about Carly, a regular girl who gets cast to star in her favorite TV show. However, things started to take a turn. During a casual meeting in his den with his wife and his friend Steve, Schneider decided that it would be much better if Carly had her own show - a show she could run herself, the way she wanted, and do whatever she wanted to do which would become a web show. In November 2006, Schneider threw out his Starstruck script, and wrote a brand new pilot called iCarly during December. The pilot was shot in January 2007. [2]During production of Zoey 101, Schneider came up with the idea of iCarly and the show's name with his friend and producer of The Big Bang Theory, Steve Molaro. He was trying to think of a good title for the new series about kids who start their own web show. However, iCarly was not going to be the original name for the show. In the pilot script, the lead girl's name was "Sam" but the URL for iSam was already taken. Schneider tried other girl's names and bought the URL for iJosie, but decided he did not like the name. Schneider tried iCarly and loved the name for the lead character. The names of the two lead girls were changed from Sam and Kira to Carly and Sam. Schneider still has the original script with Sam, Kira, and Freddie. In 2007, if the URL for iSam was not already taken, the show would have most likely been named iSam. [3]When Carly and her sassy best friend Sam act funny at a school talent show audition, tech-savvy Freddie tapes it and posts it online without telling them. After seeing the girls' strong chemistry and banter, the online audience clamors for more and the iCarly webcast is born. While grappling with typical issues of adolescence, Carly, Sam, and Freddie find out that they have also become online celebrities as their show  which features talent contests, recipes, problem-solving, and random dancing  garners international accolades.Carly lives in Seattle, Washington with her 26-year-old brother and guardian Spencer and produces the show in a makeshift third-floor studio loft in their apartment. Their mother has never been seen or mentioned, but their father, Steven Shay, is a U.S. Air Force officer temporarily stationed on a submarine, and is often mentioned but has never been seen in the show in person until the series finale episode, iGoodbye.Exterior shots of the Shays' apartment building, Bushwell Plaza, are digitally altered images of the Eastern Columbia Building in Los Angeles.A crossover between iCarly and Victorious was completed in 2010; iParty with Victorious aired on June 11, 2011. The crossover is considered a 3-part episode of iCarly. A two-hour extended version debuted August 27, 2011.In late January 2011, while doing press for her North American Dancing Crazy concert tour, Miranda Cosgrove began telling news sources that she was looking forward to returning to Hollywood to begin filming a 5th season of iCarly.[20][21][22] On January 27, 2011, Cosgrove told Cleveland Live News "We're getting ready to start the next season, right after the tour. I would be willing to do the show as long as people like it and as long as it works."[20] On January 28, 2011, Reuters news agency also reported that Cosgrove was preparing to begin filming a 5th season of iCarly,[21] and on February 3, 2011 Cosgrove told The Middletown Press, when speaking of the show and her co-stars Jennette McCurdy and Nathan Kress, Ive known them since I was little. I cant wait to get back. Im really comfortable doing iCarly. Its like my home away from home.[22] Cosgrove concluded her Dancing Crazy concert tour on February 24, 2011, and Jennette McCurdy finished her Generation Love mall tour on April 14, 2011.[23] The entire cast did not even get together until the 2011 Kids' Choice Awards. Miranda Cosgrove recently confirmed that filming would resume shortly.[24] At the 2011 Kids' Choice Awards, Jerry Trainor stated that filming would resume in May.[25]On April 14, 2011, Nickelodeon officially announced the 5th and final production season renewal of iCarly to begin in 2012 with the episodes airing later that year.[26] These episodes would air as the show's sixth season due to the second season production of 45 episodes being split into two broadcast seasons.[27][28] The third production season originally consisted of 26 episodes as ordered in early 2010, however half that amount was shot from May to September 2010 that aired as the show's fourth season. Dan Schneider then shot the next half in May 2011 to July which became a whole new season production that aired as the show's fifth season later that year. However, due to Miranda's leave for a tour on July 15, 2011, only eleven episodes were produced and the last two were held over and produced during filming of the show's final season.The final season, Season 7, began on March 24, 2012 with a total of fifteen episodes to air.[29] However, after a four month hiatus after six episodes of the season aired from March to June, "iShock America" was promoted as the start of a new season for the last batch of episodes,[30][31] effectively splitting the season into two. The series ended on November 23, 2012 with the episode "iGoodbye".Some minor alterations have been made for transmission in markets where the series is dubbed. In the German version (but not on all transmitted episodes) the intro music lyrics are in German. Episode titles are usually the same when the series is dubbed.Note: The season DVDs are released by the production seasons.Columbia Records and Nickelodeon Records have released a soundtrack for the show entitled iCarly. It includes the theme song and four original songs by Miranda Cosgrove. Several tracks by guest artists and cast dialogue are also included. A follow-up soundtrack, titled iSoundtrack II, came out on January 24, 2012.[41]In reality, the iCarly.com website contains many promotional videos by the cast (as their respective characters), as well as content created and sent in by viewers.

The pilot suggests they will be roommates who launch a babysitting business for income. The show was picked up by Nickelodeon on November 29th, 2012.[43]The second would spin-off Noah Munck's character Gibby Gibson into a self-titled sitcom named Gibby where the character works at a recreation center as a mentor to four middle school students.[44][45]iCarly received mixed reviews from critics. Carey Bryson of About.com, gave the show 2 1/2 stars, concluding "The show's comedic elements don't all rest on the irreverent, though, there are some clever storylines and even a few touching moments. Overall, the show has some great comedy, interesting stories, and fun actors."[46] The show was awarded 3 stars by Common Sense Media reviewer Emily Ashby. Emily praised that "[t]he show isn't designed to be educational, per se, but young viewers will learn a bit about interacting with media."[47]On TV.com, the show has received mixed reviews from users. Despite some negative reviews of iCarly, the series has an 8 (Great) rating on the website.[48]iCarly at TV.com1 Production2 Plot3 Characters

The series is about an "average computer-whiz-next-door" named Chuck, played by Zachary Levi, who receives an encoded e-mail from an old college friend now working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); the message embeds the only remaining copy of the United States' greatest spy secrets into Chuck's brain.[1][2]Produced by College Hill Pictures, Fake Empire, Wonderland Sound and Vision and Warner Bros. Television, the series premiered on September 24, 2007, on NBC, airing on Monday nights at 8/7c.[3][4]As the second season closed, flagging ratings put Chuck in danger of cancellation, but fans mounted a successful campaign to encourage NBC to renew the show.[5] The campaign was unique in that fans specifically targeted a sponsor of the show, the Subway restaurant chain, and the chain struck a major sponsorship deal with NBC to help cover costs of the third season.[6] The series' renewal was uncertain in each subsequent season. The fifth season was the last; it began on October 28, 2011, moving to Friday nights at 8pm/7 Central.[7] The series concluded on January 27, 2012 with a two-hour finale.[8]Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) is in his late twenties, working at a dead end job as a computer service expert at the Burbank, California Buy More (a large retail consumer-electronics chain comparable to Best Buy) with his best friend, Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez). Chuck is intelligent, but lacks ambition. His sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) and her boyfriend Devon "Captain Awesome" Woodcomb (Ryan McPartlin) are doctors who are constantly encouraging Chuck to make progress in his professional and romantic life.Bryce Larkin (Matthew Bomer), Chuck's former Stanford University roommate and now Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent, steals the Intersect, the entire merged database of the CIA and National Security Agency (NSA), and destroys the computer storing it. The sole surviving copy becomes subliminally embedded in Chuck's brain via encoded images when he opens an email from Bryce. The NSA's Major John Casey (Adam Baldwin) and CIA Agent Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski) are dispatched to investigate.Chuck is recruited to use the knowledge he now possesses to help thwart assassins and international terrorists, upending his previously mundane life. The Intersect causes Chuck to receive involuntary "flashes" of information from the database, activated by triggers such as faces, voices, objects, and keywords. In order to protect his family and friends, Chuck must keep his second occupation a secret. Casey and Walker are assigned to watch over Chuck. They are forced to establish an uneasy alliance and cover identities; Walker poses as Chuck's girlfriend and takes a job at a fast food restaurant near the Buy More, while Casey reluctantly becomes part of the Buy More sales team.The main antagonists driving the plot are a series of rogue spy cabals, first internal to the United States intelligence community and then global in scope, and a core part of the threat is the danger of the Intersect being either captured, making Chuck as much a liability as an asset to the government, or replicated, making Chuck obsolete or outmatched by less scrupulous spies.Chuck, Sarah and Casey all face professional conflicts as they grow to respect each other, and a genuine romantic interest develops between Chuck and Sarah. Chuck's desire to maintain his close relationships and eventually return to a normal life is challenged by the dangers and growing responsibilities of his secret life, and he gradually becomes a more competent, confident and willing spy.In the course of events, Chuck unravels mysteries from his life before the series, often dealing with the Intersect: why his parents left, why Bryce got him kicked out of Stanford, and why he's unusually suited for the Intersect. Meanwhile, Casey and Sarah confront unresolved issues from their lives before the series, including their families, Sarah's history with Bryce, and the spies they previously worked with. And as Chuck grows more comfortable with his own role, those closest to him are gradually drawn into his spy life.Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak wrote the script for the first episode which was initially given a put pilot commitment by NBC before a pilot order was green lit by the network in January 2007.[12] Schwartz and Fedak both attended the University of Southern California and the latter pitched the idea to Schwartz who agreed to develop the project with him.[13] Joseph McGinty Nichol, Schwartz's fellow executive producer on The O.C., directed the first hour of the series and consequently became an executive producer via his production company, Wonderland Sound and Vision. Fedak, Peter Johnson, Scott Rosenbaum, Matthew Miller and Allison Adler also serve as co-executive producers.[14] NBC gave the series an early pick-up and a thirteen-episode order on May 10, 2007.[15] On November 26, 2007, TV Guide reported that NBC had picked up the series for a full, 22 episode season.[16]Zachary Levi and Adam Baldwin were the first two to be cast in February 2007 in the roles of Chuck Bartowski and veteran NSA agent Major John Casey, respectively. Fedak always had Baldwin in mind for the role of John Casey and the producers found that the actor was a "perfect fit" for the character during the first casting session.[13][17] Relative newcomer Yvonne Strahovski was chosen for the female lead role of what was then CIA officer Sarah Kent in the same month.[18] Casting continued throughout March with Sarah Lancaster, Joshua Gomez, and Natalie Martinez landing the parts of Dr. Ellie Bartowski (Chuck's older sister), Morgan Pace (Chuck's best friend), and Kayla Hart (Chuck's neighbor and love interest), respectively.[19] The Kayla Hart character was dropped before filming because creators Chris Fedak and Josh Schwartz found it unlikely and too complicated to the storyline that two women would be pining over Chuck. Morgan's surname was later changed to "Grimes" and Sarah's surname was changed to "Walker".Although Chuck's apartment is set in Echo Park, the pilot was shot in El Cabrillo in Hollywood. After the series was picked up, the apartment and the building's courtyard were re-created on a Warner Bros. soundstage.[20] Aerial views throughout the show combine shots of Echo Park and El Cabrillo.The exterior shots of the Burbank Buy More where Chuck and Morgan work are of a former Mervyn's store in the Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park.[21]Despite heavy promotion from NBC and positive critical reviews, Chuck suffered in domestic ratings due to stiff competition from established hits from ABC (Dancing with the Stars), FOX (House), and CBS (How I Met Your Mother, Rules of Engagement) in the Monday 8:009:00pm ET timeslot. Its ratings were also affected by the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike in the first season and President Barack Obama's prime time news conference that led to the show being preempted for a week in the second season, shortly after NBC had done heavy promotion for the show around the Super Bowl. In May 2010, it was reported that Chuck ranked in the top 20 TV shows in the SocialSenseTV ratings report of social media interactions, measuring posts and reads on forums, blogs, and other social media over a three-month period.[22]Early reviews for Chuck were strong. Rolling Stone magazine included the show on its fall 2007 "We Like to Watch" list, saying the show "wipes the floor with the other fall debuts."[29] Chuck landed on USA Today's list of the "10 Picks for 2007", and they called Levi's performance "incredibly winning", giving the comedy three-out-of-four stars.[30][31] Chuck drew numerous comparisons to another critically acclaimed comedy that debuted in Fall 2007Reaperwhich also starred a twenty-something underachiever who works in a large retail, "big-box" store (Work Bench) and is drawn into heroism against his will.[29][30][32][33]As 2008 drew to a close, the show received further critical acclaim. In December of that year Time magazine named the show one of the top 10 TV series of the year.[34] It also made the year-end top 10 list of the Chicago Tribune,[35] Television Without Pity's list of TV Shows We Wish More People Watched,[36] The Star-Ledger's Top TV shows of 2008 (#4),[37] The Miami Herald's TV's Top 5 list,[38] The New York Observer's Top 10 TV Shows of the Year (#6),[39] and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette mentions Chuck as one of the few bright spots in television in 2008.[40]The Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan wrote that "the show pays attention to the mechanics of storytelling and doesn't just try to coast on the comedy." She continued, "[Given] the level of attention paid to all those other thingsemotion, suspense, plotting, characterChuck ends up being one of the TV scene's greatest pleasures at the moment."[41] Television Without Pity's Angel Cohn finds Chuck to be a well-written show, saying "it features some of the smartest and most quick-witted dialogue on TV". She praises the ensemble cast and notes "while the first season was good, this show has really hit its stride in its second season."[42] James Poniewozik of Time magazine says the show is a "delight" and that with the second season the "new episodes quickly jump back in, with higher stakes and sharper jokes."[43] The Star-Ledger's Alan Sepinwall calls Chuck "the most purely entertaining show currently on television, whether you're talking network or cable."[44] He states that "what makes Chuck so special ... is that there's a fundamental warmth and humanity underneath the jokes", with "a cast of appealing characters played by very good actors."[45]Going into 2010, Aaron Barnhart of the Kansas City Star described the show's premise as "fresh, appealing and limited", expressing concern that "a lot of TV shows overstay their welcome" and fearing that in its third season the show is "about to run out of new, workable ideas".[46] USA Today called the show NBC's "best scripted hour."[47] However, SLANT Magazine bemoaned Season 3's reinstatement of Chuck and Sarah's relationship, saying "as it stands the situation with Chuck and Sarah is worn down, tired, and typical," though he added "with a show as genuinely enjoyable as Chuck, status quo is far from a death sentence."[48]Season 1 of Chuck enjoyed much formal recognition. The program was mentioned multiple times in IGN's 2007 year-in-review awards. Along with winning the honor of Best New TV Series, Sarah Walker won the award for best TV character, and Chuck and Sarah as a couple won the "Couple That We Rooted for the Most" award. Chuck was also nominated for "Best New TV Comedy Series" at the 2008 People's Choice Awards, which aired on January 8, 2008, but lost to Samantha Who?[49] The series stunt coordinator Merritt Yohnka won the 20072008 Primetime Emmy for "Outstanding Stunt Coordination". Chuck was also nominated for "Outstanding Main Title Design" in 2007, but did not win.[50] Merritt Yohnka also won the 20082009 Primetime Emmy for "Outstanding Stunt Coordination", back-to-back wins for the same award.[51]Despite being one of the first series to be renewed by NBC for the 20082009 television season, Chuck was classified as a show "on the bubble" between renewal and cancellation in April 2009 after NBC decided to delay its decision on its renewal for a third season until early May.[56][57][58] The show's second season did not improve on or maintain the audience numbers received in the first season and has consistently obtained low ratings, making it one of the least-watched shows in its Monday 8:00pm ET timeslot.[57] Concerned that the show would not be renewed for a third season, fans launched a "Save Chuck" campaign that gained momentum with the use of social-networking websites like Twitter and Facebook.[59]Fansite ChuckTV.net launched the first organized fan effort, the Watch/Buy/Share campaign (an idea thought up by "Chuck, vs the podcast" founder Gray Jones), on March 18, 2009; a letter writing campaign was later added to the effort.[60] The week of April 6, 2009, television blogger Kath Skerry changed the name of her website GiveMeMyRemote.com to GiveMeMyChuck.com and used Twitter to notify her readers to support the show, prompting television columnists Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune and Josef Adalian of TelevisionWeek to write Chuck-related news on their websites and Twitter feeds.[61] Sepinwall also wrote an open letter to NBC on reasons for renewal, while Ryan encouraged fan support by listing the various ways in which they could contribute to the campaign to save Chuck.[62][63] One fan, Wendy Farrington, was inspired by a product placement in second season episodes to organize a campaign to purchase "Footlong" submarine sandwiches from Subway on the air date of the second season finale.[64] This movement gained support from various cast and crew members, with actor Zachary Levi seen leading hundreds of fans to a Subway restaurant in Birmingham, England.[59][65] Members of the show's cast and crew participated in a special "rally cry" episode of Chuck vs the Podcast on April 24, 2009, just before the season finale, to encourage fans to keep the campaign going and thank them for their support.[66] On the campaign, co-creator Josh Schwartz remarked that it "has been one of the most amazing experiences of [his] life to witnessand certainly the most creatively gratifying".[67] Other fan efforts include the "Have a Heart, Renew Chuck" campaign, involving Chuck fans donating money to the American Heart Association on behalf of NBC.[68][69] By the NBC upfront on May 19, 2009 over $17,000 was raised.[70][71]The campaign also prompted press and media coverage, with The Hollywood Reporter calling Chuck the "most discussed bubble show online".[72] Linda Holmes, writing for NPR, noted the support the campaign has received from both fans and critics, and comments: "It's very common for chasms to open between critics and viewers... But here, critics find themselves passionately advocating for something that's extraordinarily enjoyable to watch."[73] James Poniewozik of Time magazine wrote about the efficacy of save-this-show columns and fan protests, saying, "The sad fact of advertising-supported television is that, unlike cable, it still rewards breadth, not depth, of viewership. Four million people who watch a show really hard are still just four million people to an ad buyer. Unless they spend money."[74] He stated that the "Finale & Footlong" campaign was a far more effective way to demonstrate support since Subway is one of the show's major sponsors.[74] However, Josh Bernoff of Advertising Age remarks, "Thousands of visible, loyal viewers does not equal millions of actual viewers. Objects in the groundswell may be smaller than they appear. People who congregate online are not a representative sample."[75]In support of the show, Nestl sent more than 1,000 packs of its Wonka Nerds candy to NBC after Josh Schwartz made such a suggestion to fans in an April 20, 2009 interview with The New York Times.[76][77] Additionally, Chuck won the annual "Save Our Shows" poll by USA Today in which 43,000 people voted, topping the poll with 54% of respondents favoring renewal, beating other bubble shows such as Cold Case (45%) and Without a Trace (41%).[78] The petition campaigns were also mentioned on the May 12, 2009 episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.[79]NBC's decision to renew the show for a thirteen-episode third season was announced on May 17, 2009.[5] Both NBC's Ben Silverman and co-creator Chris Fedak have confirmed that the option remains for a pickup of nine more episodes.[80] Although Silverman has claimed that NBC is not looking to lower costs, Schwartz has stated that series production studio Warner Bros. Television had asked the producers to make budget cuts to meet a decrease in the license fee by NBC.[81] Silverman, Fedak and Schwartz have all stated that the show's quality will not be impacted.[80][81]On October 28, 2009, numerous media sources began to run reports that NBC had picked up an additional six episodes.[82][83]Questions about the series' continued viability began before the third season aired. Just hours before the third season premiere, when asked whether NBC suddenly moving Jay Leno out of primetime lowered the bar for Chuck, NBC chairman Jeff Gaspin replied, "I wouldn't say the bar's lower, but we obviously have less choice at the moment, so he's got a better shot."[84]When asked about the series' chances of being renewed for a fourth season and whether fans would have to step in again, Angela Bromstad replied, "Well, it's got to maintain, and it depends on development," but said that the show is a "pleasant surprise, and they're doing great work."[85]The ratings for Chuck slipped, falling to a series-low 1.9 demo for two weeks running as of the 11th episode of the season, "Chuck Versus the Final Exam." The "TV By The Numbers" website reported on March 23, 2010 that this was "below the ratings level that would indicate likely renewal now" despite the overall ratings difficulties that NBC was facing.[86] However, on March 30, 2010, the season's 12th episode, "Chuck Versus the American Hero" saw an increase to a 2.1 share and a 0.2million viewer rise.[87]Chuck was also a contestant in E!'s online Save One Show contest for the second year running, where it won with 52% of the vote. The runner up was One Tree Hill, which garnered 20% of the vote.[88]On May 13, 2010, it was announced that Chuck had been renewed by NBC for a fourth season.[89] The season received a 13-episode order with an option of an additional nine episodes. The fourth season premiered during NBC's fall 2010 schedule. It retained its current timeslot.[90] The premiere episode of the fourth season was titled "Chuck Versus the Anniversary",[91] and aired on September 20.[92] Season four guest starred Linda Hamilton, Dolph Lundgren, Harry Dean Stanton, Olivia Munn, Steve Austin, Dave Batista, Summer Glau, Timothy Dalton and Eric Roberts. It was announced on October 19, 2010 that NBC had ordered an additional 11 episodes of Chuck, bringing the episode total for Season 4 to 24.[93]Speculating on the possibility of a fifth season, Yvonne Strahovski (Sarah Walker), commented that she felt "...[the chances] are pretty good, I will be surprised if we don't get a season five." Her co-star Adam Baldwin (John Casey) concurred.[94]On May 13, 2011, it was announced that Chuck would be renewed for a fifth, and final, season consisting of thirteen episodes, set to premiere on October 21, 2011.[95] The show was moved from Monday and aired on Friday nights, in what some consider to be a Friday night death slot.[96][97][98][99] The premiere was later pushed a week later to October 28.[7]The first showing of the pilot occurred on July 27, 2007 at Comic-Con International in San Diego.[100] The series was originally slated to air on Tuesday nights at 9/8c as announced at the 2007 Upfronts but this was later changed to Monday nights at 8/7c as announced during the 2007 Television Critics Association summer press tour. The season premiere aired on September 24, 2007 on NBC.[4][101] The pilot was leaked onto torrent websites on July 22, 2007.[102] All thirteen episodes produced before the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike have aired. The last two episodes of the original thirteen aired on January 24, 2008, with episode 12 airing at 8/7c and episode 13 at 10/9c, three days after they aired in Canada.Despite receiving a full season pickup, the first season contained only thirteen episodes; production was stalled due to the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike.[103][104]Season Two premiered on September 29, 2008. While the series originally had a 13 episode order, NBC ordered another nine, ensuring the series would get the full 22-episode treatment.[105] The theme song is "Short Skirt/Long Jacket" by Cake.On February 2, 2009, Chuck broadcast a full-length 3D television episode. The episode was broadcast using the ColorCode 3D stereoscopy system, and could be viewed by wearing a pair of glasses distributed as part of a national promotion for the movie "Monsters Vs. Aliens", which was sponsored by Intel.[106]Season 4 appeared on the fall lineup and later received an order for 11 additional episodes on October 18, 2010.[107][108]In the U.S., all episodes of Seasons 1 through 4 are available for purchase at the Zune Marketplace, the iTunes Store, PlayStation Network, Amazon Instant Video, and Xbox Live Marketplace. Season 3 episodes (with commercials) are available the morning after US broadcast at the NBC, Hulu, IMDb (low definition Hulu), and Fancast web sites. In an aggressive marketing campaign by NBC, the pilot episode was released across a broad range of media from satellite broadcasting to popular social networking websites such as Facebook, shown on United Airlines flights, freely distributed on video on demand on about 30 cable and satellite systems including Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications and Dish Network, on Yahoo, and from Amazon Unbox.[109] Also, prior to the airing of Chuck in the United Kingdom, the pilot episode was released as a free temporary download on iTunes. A full week before the second season premiere in the US, iTunes offered a free download of the first episode as a 'pre-air premiere'. This promotion was also available on the Xbox live marketplace. Chuck can also be seen on Virgin Media's On Demand service in association with Warner TV.Both the DVD and Blu-ray Disc box sets are distributed by Warner Home Video.The DVD and Blu-ray Disc box sets of The Complete First Season contain the same special features: deleted scenes ("Declassified Scenes"); "Chuck's Worldan inside look at character development and casting sessions"; "Chuck on Chuck"commentaries by Zachary Levi, Joshua Gomez, Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak; bloopers ("Chuck vs. the Chuckles"); and "Chuck's Online Worlda gallery of web originated mini-featurettes".[121]On October 28, 2009, Warner Home Video announced that the second season of Chuck will be released on January 5, 2010.[114] Like its predecessor, Chuck: The Complete Second Season was made available in both DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats.[114] Time magazine put the DVD on its short list for January 2010, saying "Nerd wish fulfillment doesn't get funnier than this."[122]"The Complete Third Season" was released on September 7, 2010 on both DVD and Blu-ray Disc in Region 1 and October 25, 2010.On June 1, 2011, Warner Home Video announced that the fourth season of Chuck is to be released on both DVD and Blu-ray Disc September 6, 2011, but was then changed to October 11, 2011.In February 2012 Warner Brothers announced a complete Seasons 1-5 box set available on both Blu-ray and DVD. This is set to be released on May 8 in conjunction with the Season 5 box set. This box set will contain 19 discs (Blu-ray) or 23 discs (DVD) and includes all special features available in current releases.[123]In the UK, only DVD box sets are released and not Blu-ray.

MyNBC will allow fans to delve inside Chuck's "brain" which will host hot spots of top-secret government information that the title character possesses. It will also have bonus video features.[125] In addition, NBC further announced in July 2007 that tie-in micro websites where fans who log onto Buy-More.net would be directed to NerdHerdHelp.com giving them access to exclusive content of the show and a blog written by the title character's best friend and sidekick, Morgan, would be launched in September 2007.[126] NBC is reportedly expected to spend about $8million in total promoting the show.[127]Wildstorm, a DC Comics imprint, produced a six-issue mini-series written by Peter Johnson and Zev Borow (series co-executive producer and writer, respectively), with art by Jeremy Haun and Phil Noto. It started in June 2008.[128][129] A trade paperback collection was published in July 2009.[130] It also includes a public service announcement on brushing one's teeth from Captain Awesome and two gag adventures with Morgan based on film noir and The Odyssey.

Starring Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester and Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester, the series follows the brothers as they hunt demons, ghosts, monsters and other figures of the supernatural. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television, in association with Wonderland Sound and Vision. The current executive producers are Eric Kripke, McG, and Robert Singer; former executive producer Kim Manners died of lung cancer during production of the fourth season.[1]The series, which is filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, was in development for nearly ten years, as creator Kripke spent several years unsuccessfully pitching it. The pilot was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers,[2] and the ratings of the first four episodes prompted The WB to pick up the series for a full season. Originally, Kripke planned the series for three seasons, but later expanded it to five. The fifth season began airing on September 10, 2009, and concluded the series' main storyline;[3] however, The CW officially renewed the show for a sixth season on February 16, 2010.[4] On April 26, 2011, the show was renewed for a seventh season for the 20112012 season, which began on September 23, 2011.[5] On January 12, 2012, the series won the two awards at the People's Choice Awards, which includes Best Sci-Fi TV Series and Best Drama TV Series.On May 3, 2012, Supernatural was renewed for an 8th season by the CW with Jeremy Carver replacing Sera Gamble as co-showrunner with Robert Singer.[6][7]Before bringing Supernatural to television, creator Eric Kripke had been developing the series for nearly ten years,[9] having been fascinated with urban legends since he was a child.[10] Although he had envisioned Supernatural as a movie,[11] he spent years unsuccessfully pitching it as a series.[12] The concept went through several phases before becoming the eventual product, shifting from the original idea of an anthology series to one of tabloid reporters driving around the country in a van "fighting the demons in search of the truth".[10][13] Kripke wanted it to be a road trip series, feeling that it was the "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and it just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these stories."[10] Because he had previously written for the WB series Tarzan, Kripke was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network, and used the opportunity for Supernatural.[11] However, the network disliked his tabloid reporter idea, so Kripke successfully pitched his last-minute idea of the characters being brothers.[14] He decided to have the brothers be from Lawrence, Kansas, due to its closeness to Stull Cemetery, a location famous for its urban legends.[15]When it came time to name the two lead characters, Kripke decided on "Sal" and "Dean" as an homage to Jack Kerouac's road-trip novel On the Road. However, he felt that "Sal" was inappropriate for a main character, and changed the name to "Sam".[8] It was originally intended for the brothers' last name to be "Harrison" as a nod to actor Harrison Ford, as Kripke wanted Dean to have the "devil-may-care swagger of Han Solo". However, there was a Sam Harrison living in Kansas, so the name had to be changed for legal reasons.[16] Combining his interest in the Winchester Mystery House and his desire to give the series the feel of "a modern-day Western", Kripke settled on the surname of "Winchester". However, this also presented a problem. The first name of Sam and Dean's father was originally "Jack", and there was a Jack Winchester residing in Kansas, so Kripke was forced to change the character's name to "John".[16]Eric Kripke on the decision to add the Impala.[17]Growing up, Kripke connected to television shows that had signature cars, such as The Dukes of Hazzard and Knight Rider. This prompted him to include one in Supernatural.[17] He originally intended for the car to be a '65 Mustang, but his neighbor convinced him to change it to a '67 Impala, since "you can put a body in the trunk" and because "you want a car that, when people stop next to it at the lights, they lock their doors."[8] Kripke has commented, "It's a Rottweiler of a car, and I think it adds authenticity for fans of automobiles because of that, because it's not a pretty ride. It's an aggressive, muscular car, and I think that's what people respond to, and why it fits so well into the tone of our show."[17]Kripke had previously pitched the series to Fox executive Peter Johnson, and when Johnson moved to Wonderland Sound and Vision as president of TV, he contacted Kripke.[18] Johnson soon signed on as co-executive producer, as did Wonderland owner McG as executive producer, with the production company set to make the pilot episode. Before it could be filmed, however, script issues needed to be dealt with. Originally, the brothers were not raised by their father, but rather by their aunt and uncle. Thus, when Dean comes to Sam for assistance in the pilot episode, he has to convince him that the supernatural exists. However, Kripke realized that this made the backstory too complicated, and reworked it with Peter Johnson so that their father raised them to be hunters.[19] The script went through many additional revisions. One of the original ideas was for Sam's girlfriend Jessica being revealed as a demon, which prompts him to join Dean on the road; however, Kripke felt it was more appropriate for Sam's motivation to be Jessica's death, so he had her killed in the same manner as Sam's mother, making them the "right bookends".[20] Other revised concepts include Sam believing Dean to be a serial killer that murders their father,[21] and their father dying in Jessica's place.[22] Filming for the pilot episode was greenlit after director David Nutter, who previously had worked with Kripke on Tarzan, signed on.[23][24] When the series was eventually picked up, the studio brought on Robert Singer as executive producer, as it wanted Kripke to work with someone with production experience. Co-executive producer John Shiban was also hired to help design the series mythology due to his previous work on The X-Files.[25] Kripke had the series planned out for three seasons, but later expanded it to five,[26] and hoped to end it there on a high note.[27]The staff for the first season consisted of Kripke and five other writers, with assistants to help with researching urban legends.[11] Most of the work done in writing the series is very collaborative, with the writers often breaking up into groups. At the beginning of each season, the writers are brought together and pitch out their ideas, which are then assigned to a specific writer to be developed. Each story idea is outlined on a dry-erase board, with Kripke and Bob Singer making necessary changes. Afterward, the script is written,[28] and Kripke goes through it to make sure it has the same tone as other episodes.[11] Kripke found this task very difficult to do in the first season,[29] but he felt it became easier by the third season, as the staff came to "really understand the show's style".[29]The tone of Supernatural was heavily influenced by films such as Poltergeisthaving the horror happen in a family setting rather than remote locationand Evil Dead 2 and An American Werewolf in Londonhaving bits of comedy mixed in. Commenting on the former, Kripke added, "It's the idea that horror can happen in your own backyard. How many viewers have to worry about the vampire in the gothic castle?"[8] Other influences include The Two Sisters and Asian horror films The Eye, Ju-on, and Ring.[30]Eric Kripke[26]According to creator Eric Kripke, the show originally was intended to focus on the weekly monsters, with Sam and Dean Winchester merely being "an engine to get us in and out of different horror movies every week".[31] His sole desire was to merely "scare the crap out of people".[32] However, a few episodes in, Kripke and executive producer Bob Singer noticed the onscreen chemistry between Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles. This revelation caused them to change the series to focus more on the brothers than the monsters, basing the weekly monster around the storyline they wanted for the Winchesters. According to Kripke, "...sometimes we don't even have the monster until way late in the break, once we get all the angst and the drama done first."[31]Unlike shows with "endless mythology" like Lost, Kripke prefers to keep Supernatural's mythology simpler, saying, "It's so hard to go season after season after season with a mystery and then provide an answer that's going to be satisfying." He prefers to have the series' structure like that of the earlier X-Files episodes, having mythology-based episodes spread through many self-enclosed episodesSupernatural usually having three self-enclosed episodes followed by a mythology episode. With this format, viewers do not have to have previous knowledge of the mythology in order to watch the series, being able to "join the party at any time".[33]Though companies were hired for work on the pilot episodesuch as Entity FX for the visual effects[34]effects departments now work exclusively for the series.[35] Ivan Hayden is the visual effects supervisor, and works with many levels of the production staff. During pre-production, Hayden must go through the scripts, looking for possible visual effects. He then has a concept meeting with the writers, and after settling on the effect designs to use, coordinates with the special effects and stunt departments. Hayden is also present during filming to help the director make sure that the scenes are being filmed in the best way for the visual effects, such as by ensuring that the actors are looking at the correct location where an effect will later be added. Afterward, he then meets with the editors.[36] Another aspect of the visual effects department is coming up with rules and physics for each supernatural creature,[36] though the rules are often bent if it benefits the story.[35] In 2012, it was announced that Hayden will be working at the new Vancouver location of Encore for its VFX division.[37]Supernatural features a synthesized orchestral score, although real instruments such as guitars and cellos are used at times. Special instruments have also been used in specific episodes, such as playing "bluesy gospel music" on a broken-down piano in the faith-healing episode "Faith". Unlike other television shows, the series features two composers: Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska.[38] Each composer scores every other episode, giving them extra time to write the scores, which usually end up being around 30 minutes per episode. They write themes for their own episodes and characters and work with one another if there is overlap between episodes. They try to base the music on the visuals of the episode, such as in the episode "Dead in the Water", in which off-angle shots are accompanied by repetitive and discordant notes, and spoken words such as "water" and "die" are followed by a lower pitch to create a "gurgly" sound.[39] While there are similarities in the scores for situations such as the brothers and their father, about a third of each episode's score is newly written for the series.[38]While original scores are used throughout episodes, another important aspect of the series' music is classic rock, over which creator Eric Kripke threatened to quit when the network would not allow its inclusion. Most of the songs are from Kripke's private collection, although one of his favorite bandsLed Zeppelinis too expensive to use. Some episode titles are references to Led Zeppelin songs.[40] The series has featured such bands as Blue yster Cult, Bad Company, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Rush and AC/DC on more than one occasion. Multiple songs are usually used throughout each episode, and accompany "The Road So Far" sequences before select episodes that highlight a montage of past events. Although Kripke prefers to keep a fine line between the score and songs used, sometimes Lennertz and Gruska are required to write short sections of rock-like music to fill 15-to-20-second gaps, as it would be too costly to acquire song rights. Usually on the last episode of every season, the song "Carry On Wayward Son" by Kansas is played at the beginning.[41]Though the pilot was filmed in Los Angeles, principal filming takes place in Vancouver, British Columbia.[21] Thus, on-location filming usually takes place in the area. "Dead in the Water" was filmed at Buntzen Lake,[42] and the final scenes of "Simon Said" were filmed at Cleveland Dam.[43] Other locations used on the show are often reused two or three times, with the art department making variations to conceal this.[44] Heritage Park in Burnaby has been used as a cemetery in "Red Sky at Morning", and as the location of the gingerbread-house cottage in "Bedtime Stories".[45] Also, Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam has served many functions for the series, including an asylum in "Asylum",[46] a hospital in "In My Time of Dying",[47] and a prison in "Folsom Prison Blues".[47] The episode "Houses of the Holy" was filmed on location in Vancouver at St.Andrew's-Wesley United Church. Because episodes usually take place in the middle of nowhere, filming often takes place at an old military base. Having been shut down for years, the buildings have been removed, leaving just roads on which sets are erected, such as for crossroads scenes.[48]Rather than having the series debut on television, The WB instead made the pilot episode available for online streaming through Yahoo! a week before it was set to premiere on the network as part of a promotional scheme.[49] Following the transition to The CW, Supernatural episodes were added to Apple's iTunes Store starting in December 2006, being one of the first CW series to be made available for sale online.[50] The following month, the network began streaming episodes of the series on its website with limited commercial interruption, available for up to four weeks after the initial airings.[51] Beginning January 11, 2007, Australia's Network Ten also began offering full episodes for download via their website, through a deal with Warner Bros. Television.[52] To combat piracy, Ten debuted the second season premiere five days before its initial broadcast in the country, making Supernatural the first major network show available for free download in Australia before being aired. Subsequent episodes became available online just hours after being televised.[53] Around the same time, episodes were also made available for download on Microsoft's Xbox Live Marketplace.[54] In September 2008, Amazon.com launched its new on-demand TV service, with Supernatural being one of the many television shows available for sale.[55]The first season of Supernatural was released as a six-disc Region 1 DVD box set in the US on September 5, 2006, three weeks before the premiere of the second season. Including all 22 episodes of the first season, the set also featured DVD extras such as commentaries for the episodes "Pilot" and "Phantom Traveler", deleted scenes, bloopers, featurettes, and a DVD-ROM sneak-peek at the second season.[56] The set was later packaged with the first season of Smallville as a "Season One Starter Pack", which was released on September 18, 2007.[57] For Region 2, the season was split into two parts, being released on May 22, 2006,[58] and August 21, 2006;[59] the complete set was released on October 2, 2006.[60]The second season was released as a six-disc Region 1 DVD box set in the US on September 11, 2007,[61] two weeks before the premiere of the third season. Including all 22 episodes of the second season, the set also featured DVD extras such as episode commentaries, deleted scenes, bloopers, Jared Padalecki's original screen test, and a featurette on the making of the season finale.[62] For Region 2, the season was again divided into two parts, being released on May 14, 2007,[63] and September 10, 2007;[64] the complete set was released on October 29, 2007.[65]The third season was released as a five-disc Region 1 DVD box set in the US on September 2, 2008,[66] two weeks before the premiere of the fourth season, and was eventually released on Blu-ray on November 11, 2008.[67] Including all 16 episodes of the third season, the set featured limited DVD extras, having only bloopers and featurettes.[66] Also included was a digital copy of the season.[66] Best Buy carried a limitedonly 26,500 availablebox set that included a GreenLight Collectibles 1:64 scale replica of a black 1967 Chevy Impala, the car used by the Winchesters throughout the series.[68] For Region 2, the season was released on August 25, 2008, this time only as a complete set,[69] and its Blu-ray counterpart debuted November 10, 2008.[70]The fourth season was released in Region 1 as both a six-disc DVD box set and as a four-disc Blu-ray box set in the US on September 1, 2009, one week before the premiere of the fifth season. Including all 22 episodes of the fourth season, the set featured commentaries, bloopers, extended and deleted scenes, and a featurette on Supernatural's mythology.[71] Target bundled a bonus DVD of the Supernatural panel at Comic-Con.[72] As with the first two seasons in Region 2, the fourth season was also divided into two parts, being released on April 27, 2009,[73] and September 21, 2009;[74] the complete set and its Blu-ray counterpart were released on November 2, 2009.[75][76]The fifth season was released with Part 1 in the United Kingdom (Region 2) on April 26, 2010.[77] Part 2 was released on July 12, 2010.[78] The complete release was on October 18, 2010.[79]In Australia, the first 7 seasons have been released on DVD, region 4 (including a season 15 box set) and on Blu-ray, region B. On 31st October 2012 a new boxset was released of seasons 1-7 to coincide with the release of the 7th season on DVD and Blu-ray.Jensen Ackles on what drew him to the character of Dean Winchester.[80]The series focuses primarily on the brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, as they travel throughout the country hunting down evil supernatural creatures, mostly demons. Padalecki became interested in the role due to his liking of horror series such as The X-Files and Twilight Zone, which he found similar to Supernatural. He was also excited to play "the reluctant hero", comparing Sam to The Matrix's Neo and Luke Skywalker of Star Wars. Padalecki had previous experience working with executive producers McG and David Nutter,[81] the former convincing him to audition for the role.[82] Ackles was originally asked by Nutter to audition for the role of Sam,[83] but preferred the character of Dean after reading the script.[80] At the time of his audition, he was already a series regular on fellow WB series Smallville. After landing the part of Dean, his Smallville role was cut short.[84]While the series does not have many lead characters, there are many recurring characters. Jeffrey Dean Morgan portrays John Winchester, father of Sam and Dean. Making an appearance in the pilot episode, John does not return until nearly halfway through the first season, after which he becomes a recurring character until his eventual death in the second season's premiere episode, though his spirit returns to help his sons in the season finale. According to writer John Shiban, it was decided early on that John would die. The writers found that having the brothers being separated from their father "split the show". Shiban noted that "...the boys were looking for Dad, and they were looking for a monster of the week, whatever that is, whatever case crosses their path. It became difficult, because we thought it was like - 'what is Dad doing? Is he doing more interesting things than the boys are doing, or what?'"[85] They believed Morgan was initially reluctant about returning to Supernatural for the second season due to his recurring role on the series Grey's Anatomy.[86] Future appearances of the character have been hindered due to Morgan's busy schedule.[87]Also introduced in the first season are the demon Azazel and his unnamed daughter. While Azazel mainly appears merely as shadows or silhouettes in the first season, only taking physical form when he possesses John Winchester, Azazel's daughter uses a girl named Meg Mastersportrayed by Nicki Lynn Aycoxas a host.[88] In the second season premiere, Azazel's host is portrayed by Fredric Lehne; originally brought on only for one episode, Lehne impressed the showrunners so much that he was asked to return for the season's two-part finale.[89] Even after the character's death, Azazel makes appearances in the fourth season, being portrayed, respectively, by Christopher B. MacCabe and Mitch Pileggi in the time travel episode "In the Beginning" and by Rob LaBelle in a flashback in the season finale. Likewise, after Azazel's daughter is exorcised from Meg towards the end of the first season, the demon and her host continued to appear in the series, although now as two separate characters. Aycox continued her role in the fourth season when the angry spirit of Meg tries to kill the Winchesters. The demon returns for an episode in the second season, temporarily taking Sam as a host. She appears once again in the fifth season premiere, her newest host being portrayed by Rachel Miner, and returns to play a prominant role in season 7.The writers eventually wanted to flesh out the concept of hunters, resulting in the introduction of many new characters.[91] Actor Jim Beaver makes his first appearance as Bobby Singer, an old family friend of the Winchesters, at the end of the first season. Becoming a sort of surrogate father to Sam and Dean after their father's death,[92] the character acts as their mentor and foremost point of contact before his departure in the seventh season. Other hunters appear in the second season with the introduction of Harvelle's Roadhouse, a saloon frequented by hunters. It is owned by Ellen Harvelle (played by Samantha Ferris), whose late husband was a friend of John Winchester. Working alongside her mother is Jo Harvelle (played by Alona Tal). Also present is the computer guy Ash (played by Chad Lindberg), who uses his vast computer skills to track the paranormal. Tal was eventually written out of the series, and believes the reason to be that the producers felt she looked like Sam and Dean's "14-year-old sister".[93] Kripke claims the character was incorrectly conceived, and also cites poor fan reaction for her removal.[94] Also, the character of Ash is killed off in the second season finale with the destruction of the Roadhouse. Ellen was meant to return in the third season, but the episode had to be scrapped due to the writer's strike.[95] The writers intended for her to be featured in the third season finale,[96] but Ferris declined because the deal offered to her was not acceptable, as "It could cost [her] money and work".[97] However, both actresses returned as Jo and Ellen in the fifth season.For the third season, the writers decided to introduce Ruby, a demonic former witch who claims to the Winchesters to be an ally, to the cast. However, the CW requested that another female be added, so the character Bela Talbot, a self-centered thief who sells occult objects to wealthy clients and who was already intended to appear in multiple episodes, was upgraded to a series regular.[98] Katie Cassidy and Lauren Cohan were eventually cast as Ruby and Bela, respectively, though they originally auditioned for the others' role.[99] Though only making six appearances each in the third season, both actresses were credited as co-stars for their episodes. At the end of the season, Bela was killed off[100] and Cassidy was let go due to budgetary reasons.[101] Ruby was recast for the fourth season, auditions only describing the character as "a love interest". Genevieve Cortese (who later married Padalecki) took over the role until the character's death at the end of the season.[102]Wanting to bring in Christian mythology to the series, the writers created the angel Castiel to introduce it.[103] With Kripke wanting to keep the introduction of angels a secret, the character was instead described as a demon during auditions.[104] Misha Collins was cast as the character. Making his debut in the fourth season premiere, Castiel resurrects Dean from Hell after his death in the third season, and comes to be an ally of the Winchesters. The character was originally intended for only a six-episode story arc, but the role was later expanded.[105] Collins was promoted to a series regular for the fifth and sixth season, something Collins believes to be mainly due to fan support.[106]Along with Castiel came other angelic characters, with Robert Wisdom portraying the "militant" and "dogmatic"[107] Uriel, who secretly supports Lucifer; Julie McNiven playing the fallen angel Anna Milton, who eventually regains her angelic form but remains an outcast of Heaven; and Kurt Fuller as Castiel's boss Zachariah, who wishes to start the Apocalypse in order to bring Paradise to Earth. Though Wisdom's character is eventually killed, McNiven and Fuller continue their roles into the fifth season, and are joined by Mark Pellegrino as the recently released Lucifer. Pellegrino had been the second choice for the role of Castiel,[108] and was offered the role of Lucifer without an audition.[109] Further on, Fuller and McNiven's characters were also killed along with both Harvelle characters.Because the show focuses mainly on the two Winchester brothers, the writers realized that viewers would know that the characters are not in danger of being permanently killed. To fix this, the staff often writes in guest characters to give tension to the episode, occasionally having them die.[110]Season One aired in the United States beginning September 13, 2005, and ending May 4, 2006. The first sixteen episodes aired on Tuesdays at 9:00 pm, after which the series was rescheduled to Thursdays.[111]After their mother's death in a suspicious fire that burns down their house, Dean and Sam Winchester live a life on the road with their father as they grow up. Years pass and the boys team up to find their father, John, who goes missing on a hunting trip. However, their father is not a typical hunter: he hunts supernatural creatures like ghosts, vampires, and spirits and he's trained his sons to do the same. Along the way, Sam and Dean save innocent people, fight creatures and ghosts, and collect clues to their father's whereabouts. Sam begins to mysteriously develop psychic abilities and visions as they travel. They eventually find and reunite with their father, who reveals that the creature that killed Sam and Dean's mother years earlier is the demon Azazel (Aka "Yellow Eyes") and the only thing that can kill him is a legendary gun created by Samuel Colt. The season ends with the brothers and their father involved in a car crash when a truck hits the side of the Impala. They lie inside the car, covered in blood and unconscious.Season Two consists of 22 episodes that aired on Thursdays at 9:00 pm in the United States beginning September 28, 2006, and ending May 17, 2007.[112]The season follows Sam and Dean as they deal with their father's death (he traded his life for Dean's with Yellow-Eyes after the car crash) and continue to hunt this demon, who also caused the fire that led to the deaths of their mother and later, Sam's girlfriend, Jessica. They have assistance from new allies Ellen, Jo, and Ash. Part of Yellow-Eyes's master plan is eventually revealed as he gathers Sam and others like him to fight each other, leading to Sam dying. Dean makes a deal with the crossroads demon to bring back Sam in exchange for his soul, which will be collected in one year and taken to Hell. Yellow-Eyes opens a portal to Hell and as hundreds of demons and souls escape, has a final confrontation with the Winchesters. With the help of the spirit of John Winchester who escaped Hell through the portal, Dean finally kills Yellow-Eyes and the portal is closed, but the Winchesters and their allies are left to deal with the demon army that has been unleashed and the one-year contract Dean has before he goes to Hell.Season Three consists of 16 episodes that aired on Thursdays at 9:00 pm in the United States beginning October 4, 2007, and ending May 15, 2008.[113] Originally 22 episodes were ordered for the third season, but production was halted on December 5, 2007, upon completion of the twelfth episode due to the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike. The season number was shortened to sixteen episodes, with four new episodes airing in April and May 2008.[114]The season mainly focuses on trying to save Dean from his deal and tracking down the fury that was released from the gate. Along the way, the brothers meet Ruby, a 'good' demon, who has an interest in Sam and claims to be able to help save Dean. Also, they meet Bela Talbot, an "acquirer" and seller of occult objects, who is constantly a thorn in their side. The brothers eventually learn from Bela which demon holds Dean's contract: one being of great power named Lilith. Lilith takes Bela's soul after her contract expires but not before she has warned Sam and Dean. The brothers, along with Ruby, track her down and attempt to kill her. Lilith is unable to stop Sam due to his mysterious abilities; however, Dean's contract expires and his soul is taken to Hell.Season Four consists of 22 episodes that aired on Thursdays at 9:00 pm in the United States beginning September 18, 2008, and ending May 14, 2009.[115]Dean is rescued from Hell and brought back by an angel named Castiel, one of several angels who appears throughout the season. The rest of the season follows the brothers as they work with Castiel to stop Lilith's plan of breaking the 66 seals, which would allow Lucifer to walk free once again. Sam and Dean's relationship is also strained as Sam starts siding with Ruby over Dean. He also begins to give into his demonic side by drinking demon blood to become strong enough to defeat Lilith. He and Dean eventually have a falling out and Sam sides fully with Ruby in his obsessive quest to kill Lilith. Dean makes a deal with the angels to save Sam and learns that they want the Apocalypse to come in order to rebuild Earth as a Paradise. With aid from Castiel, Dean escapes and tries to stop Sam as he has learned that Lilith is in fact the last seal, but Sam kills her anyway, breaking open Lucifer's prison. Ruby reveals her true colors as a demon loyal to Lucifer and Dean kills her, but as the season ends, Lucifer's Cage opens and he starts to escape.Season Five consists of 22 episodes[116] and was rumored to be the last season, due to Eric Kripke's statements over the years that he had planned for the show to run for only five seasons.[27] Despite this, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles had contracts for a sixth season,[117] and The CW renewed the series on February 16, 2010.[4]The fifth season revolves around the fight to stop Lucifer and save the world from the Apocalypse. Throughout the season, Dean and Sam battle both angels and demons as they fight their destiny to become the vessels of Michael and Lucifer. One way they attempt to stop Lucifer is to retrieve the Colt and kill him with it, but this fails as Lucifer can't be killed by the Colt and they lose fellow hunters and friends Jo and Ellen in the process. This and the revelation that God will not help stop the Apocalypse drive Dean to agree to Michael, but he ultimately doesn't go through with it, killing the angel Zachariah who has been tormenting the brothers all season instead. Michael ultimately takes Adam Milligan, Sam and Dean's newly resurrected half-brother as a vessel instead. Unable to defeat Lucifer, they collect the rings of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, which act as the keys to Lucifer's prison. The idea of destiny versus freedom and choice plays a large role. Throughout the season, Dean, Sam, Castiel, and Bobby each have a crisis as they near giving up. However, through each other's support, they continue forward until the end. It is also notable that Dean and Castiel have an ongoing friendship during this season, while Dean and Sam initially grow further apart. In the end, after Sam allows Lucifer to possess him and he kills Bobby and Castiel, who is now human, Sam manages to regain control thanks to his bond with Dean and throws himself, Lucifer, Michael and Adam Milligan (possessed by Michael) into Hell to trap Lucifer once more. Castiel is resurrected more powerful than ever by God and returns to Heaven to restore order after resurrecting Bobby. Dean returns to his old girlfriend Lisa to live a normal life, but Sam is shown mysteriously free and watching his brother.Season Six consists of 22 episodes. Creator Eric Kripke originally planned for the show to last only five seasons, but due to increased ratings from the fourth and fifth seasons,[118] the CW network renewed the series for a sixth season.[119] Kripke has not returned as showrunner, but still remained as a hands-on executive producer, leaving executive producer Sera Gamble to take over the reins.[118]The sixth season begins a year after the conclusion of the fifth season, with Dean living a somewhat happy life with Lisa and Ben. When an emotionless Sam returns to Dean, he is forced to leave his new life behind. Dean is forced to work with his grandfather Samuel to capture Alpha Monsters. The brothers are unable to get help from Castiel due to a civil war in heaven against the archangel Raphael, and they cannot trust Samuel. Dean's suspicions are confirmed when he finds Samuel working with demons to discover the location of Purgatory. Dean finds that Sam's soul is still in Hell, so he implores the help of the Horseman Death in order to retrieve it. In order to ensure Sam does not remember Hell, Death blocks that part of Sam's memory using a mental wall. The brothers discover Castiel to be behind the events of Sam's return, the hunt for the Alpha Monsters, and the search for Purgatory. When the brothers try to stop Castiel, he brings Sam's memory of Hell back and goes ahead with his plan, absorbing all the souls from Purgatory and pronouncing himself God due to having ascended beyond an angel.On April 26, 2011, CW announced early renewals for five shows for the 2012 season which included a seventh season for Supernatural with 23 episodes. The seventh season aired on September 23, 2011.After declaring himself God, Castiel goes forth to try and punish all the wrongdoers in the world, garnering attention. Very quickly though, he discovers that he had absorbed Leviathan as well who are breaking free. Sam and Dean manage to return the Purgatory souls but fail to return the Leviathans who seemingly kill Castiel before vanishing. The Leviathans inhabit the bodies of many different people around the world, with Sam and Dean learning their weakness Borax, though it has minimum effectiveness on the Leviathan leader, Dick Roman. After Roman kills Bobby, Dean becomes obsessed with taking the Leviathans down and learns of a facility they are making, only to learn it is a facility to cure cancer as one Leviathan puts it: "We're only here to help". The spirit of Bobby later confirms that while they are curing disease, they are doing it as part of their grand plan to turn humanity into the perfect food source. With the help of Castiel, the brothers learn that the only way to kill the Leviathans is with the "bone of a righteous mortal washed in the three bloods of the fallen" and set out to find those three bloods. Eventually Dean and Castiel kill Dick, but are dragged into Purgatory as a result while Sam is left alone to deal with Crowley, who plans to rise to power now that the Leviathans are disorganized.Key plot points presented in the season were Sam struggling with the constant hallucinations of Lucifer and the ghost of Bobby "haunting" Sam and Dean through his alcohol flask. Bobby's rage towards Dick Roman slowly causes him to become a vengeful spirit, and Sam and Dean trying to deal with this fact ultimately leads them to burn his flask at his request, destroying Bobby.On May 3, 2012, Supernatural was renewed for an eighth season by the CW.[6] Season 8 premiered October 3, 2012.[120]One year after being dragged to Purgatory, Dean returns to Earth without Castiel, carrying inside his body the soul of a vampire named Benny. During that period, Sam stopped his life of hunting and started a relationship with a veterinarian named Amelia, but, by the time Dean returns, their relationship had already ended. Dean secretly helps Benny retake his body and reunites with Sam. Together, the brothers discover that Kevin has escaped from Crowley's hands, and the prophet reveals that Crowley discovered another "Word Of God" tablet, which contains spells capable of closing all the gates of Hell forever, locking all the demons inside. However, it is also capable of doing the opposite, of throwing open the gates and allowing all demons onto the Earth, which is what Crowley wants. Kevin also reveals that he stole the tablet and hid it, causing Crowley to chase him, killing his girlfriend in the process. Eventually, Kevin's mother joins her son's journey. Sam discovers Benny's existence which causes the two brothers to quarrel with each other and Castiel mysteriously returns from Purgatory. Kevin is again captured by Crowley, who tortures him and makes him reveal the existence of the other tablets and their powers, but the prophet is once again saved by Castiel.The season features two flashback stories in parallel to the episode's main story, one showing Sam's relationship with Amelia and another showing Dean's time in Purgatory. It's revealed that Castiel, who was dragged along with Dean, survived and recovered from his madness in Purgatory, but at the moment of escaping, he chose to stay and purge his sins. Unknown to them, Castiel discovers that he was brought back by a group of angels under the orders of a high-ranked angel named Naomi, who now seems to control him. Naomi reveals to Castiel that he will not remember any of their encounters and he'll report periodically to her about the Winchesters and their plans.At Comic-Con 2012, showrunner Jeremy Carver revealed his overall plan of plotting out a story that will help him at least reach his goal of the end of season 10. [121]While the locations and storyline change on a near weekly basis, there are a few things that show up regularly.The 1835 Colt Paterson revolver,[122] usually referred to as "the Colt", was made by Samuel Colt, a paranormal hunter. According to legend, anything shot by this gun, using one of its thirteen original bullets, will die, including creatures normally immune to any and all weapons. John Winchester gives it to the demon Azazel in return for Dean's life being spared after an almost-fatal car crash, and at the end of the second season, Azazel uses it as a key to open a gateway to Hell that Samuel Colt had sealed. The last bullet is then used to kill the demon, though the gun is later altered to allow the use of more bullets. Towards the end of the third season, Lilith's right-hand demon Crowley acquires the gun and hides it. It is then featured in two time-travel episodes- Dean using a past version of it when he is sent back to 1973 and his future self discovering it when Dean is sent five years into the future-, before Crowley returns it to the Winchesters so that they can kill Lucifer. However, after Dean shoots Lucifer in the head at point-blank range, an unharmed Lucifer boasts there are five things in creation which the gun cannot kill, and he is one of them. It is unknown what happened to the weapon after that point, as its only subsequent appearance on the show was a chronologically earlier version, seen when the Winchesters travel to 1861. Sam gets it from Samuel Colt and Dean uses it to kill a Phoenix as they need its ashes. Dean drops the Colt just before being transported back to the present day, where it is presumably retrieved by the saloon owner Elkins, the ancestor of Daniel Elkins, who possessed the weapon at the beginning of the series.The gun used in the series is actually a replica Paterson modified to fire metallic cartridges.[122] The gun was described as being built in 1835, before Colt made firearms, and fires metallic cartridges which were never made to fire in a Colt revolver until 10 years after Samuel Colt's death. On the barrel of the gun is inscribed the Latin phrase non timebo mala, meaning "I will fear no evil".[123] On the handle is a carving of a pentagram, with much of the finish removed to give it an aged appearance.[122] The props department also has a rubber version of the Colt to be used in fight scenes for pistol-whipping.[124]Throughout the series, Dean drives a black 1967 Chevrolet Impala. Having been passed down to him by his father (John), it is Dean's most prized possession, with actor Jensen Ackles feeling it is Dean's "life" and "sanctuary".[125] The brothers travel in it throughout the country as they hunt the supernatural, and the trunk holds various weaponry and their fake ID's. In the first two seasons, it has a Kansas license plate with the number KAZ 2Y5, a reference to the Winchesters' home state of Kansas, and the series premiere date of 2005.[125] Towards the end of the second season, the car sports a new Ohio license plate (CNK 80Q3) to aid the brothers in hiding from the FBI.[126]The origins of the Impala were first depicted in the comic mini-series Supernatural: Origins, in which John Winchester takes ownership of the car from Mary's uncle after accidentally getting him killed during a hunt. However, fans responded negatively to this, as John is shown with the Impala in the teaser for the pilot episode, which is chronologically set before the comic series. Due to this, the comic was altered for the trade paperback version,[127] with the Impala's true origins later being depicted in the series' fourth season. Having been sent back to 1973 by the angel Castiel, Dean convinces his father to purchase the Impala over a 1964 VW Van. The car's origins were further explored during the season five finale, in which a frame story surrounded the plot of the episode tracking the Impala's history from its manufacture, through several previous owners, up until the present day. According to Chuck Shirley, the brothers have "made it their own," and they are shown as kids sticking an army man into an ash tray that remains there (Sam), putting blocks into the heating vents (Dean) and carving their initials into the car. The Impala later proves important when seeing the old army man allows Sam to overpower Lucifer during the final confrontation. According to Chuck, as they have the Impala, the Winchesters never consider themselves truly homeless. In the seventh season, after two Leviathans go on a killing spree in an identical Impala, Sam and Dean are forced to put the car into storage and use various other cars as they are too identifiable with the Impala. Dean later pulls it out of storage to confront Dick and has the demon Meg crash it into Sucrocorp to create a distraction. During season 8, Sam and Dean are once again using the Impala as their car.All of the cars used in the show are stock 1967 Chevrolet Impala four door hardtops. They feature Chevrolet small-block engines, recolored interiors, custom seats, and nonfunctioning radios. Other than the one used in the original, all of the Impalas had to be painted black for the series. One of the Impalas used features a detachable roof and doors for up-close shots, and is capable of being separated in half.[124]Ruby possessed a mysterious and presumably magical demon-killing knife, which Kripke refers to as "a hand-to-hand version of the Colt".[128] Its handle is made of elk antlers, and the knife has engravings on both sides of the blade, although the symbols are all nonsensical.[128] It has been seen and used many times following its introduction in the third season. Upon being stabbed in a vital area, the demon is almost immediately killed, usually taking the human host with it. The only known survivor is Bobby Singer who stabbed himself with it while fighting off a possession and was left paralyzed as a result. It is unknown if it is effective against other supernatural beings, although it is useless against angels. Furthermore, the demon Alastair is resistant to the knife's power. How the knife functions has yet to be revealed, and creator Eric Kripke doubts it ever will be, stating, "I like to leave some things mysterious. And that's likely to remain mysterious."[87]Because Dean and Sam do not get paid for their hunting, the brothers earn their living and pay for their hunting equipment through credit card fraud, poker winnings, and pool hustling. Furthermore, their investigations often put them on the wrong side of the law, as they have desecrated graves, impersonated various officials, and committed breaking and entering. Framed for murder and bank robbery by shapeshifters, Dean has become a highly wanted man, and the brothers are occasionally pursued by various law enforcement officers, most notably FBI Agent Victor Henricksen. Because of their wanted status, the brothers often use aliases, usually derived from hard rock musicians, film references, or a meta-reference. However, in the third season's mid-season finale episode "Jus in Bello", Sam and Dean are presumed dead in the explosion of the Monument, Colorado Sheriff's county jail, effectively ending the FBI's pursuit of them. By the seventh season, however, the FBI are in pursuit of the brothers again, believing them to be mass-murderers (while the murders were actually committed by Leviathans impersonating the Winchesters). However, with the help of a sheriff who learns the truth and the bodies of their doppelgangers, they are able to fake their deaths again, but have to lie low to prevent discovery, abandoning the Impala and taking on new aliases.The advertisements The WB chose for the show went beyond just commercials and billboards. Before the series debuted, the network placed signs for the show at gas station pumps, and gave out rubber glow-in-the-dark bracelets at New York and Los Angeles movie theaters.[49] Also, coffee cup sleeves revealed the image of a "terrified woman seemingly pinned to a ceiling" when heated[129] were distributed to 500 cafes throughout New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.[49] The same image was used in special mirrors the network installed in almost 200 nightclubs throughout three cities in order to reach "young, hip horror fans".[129] Additional advertisements were also placed in bars, movie theaters, and video game stores, with hundreds of the bars also receiving Supernatural napkins and coasters.[49]The series also has many real-life tie-ins. The urban legend website Hellhounds Lair featured in the Season One episode "Hell House" is a real website set up by the show's producers.[130] As a tie-in to the sequel episode "Ghostfacers", in which the owners of Hellhounds Lair create their own Ghost Hunters-style reality show, The CW set up Ghostfacers.com.[131] The Winchesters later visit this website in the fourth season episode "It's a Terrible Life". Series tie-ins, however, extend beyond the internet. For a time, Dean's cell numberrevealed in the first season episode "Phantom Traveler"[132] to be 18669073235was a real number, with Jensen Ackles reading the message: "This is Dean Winchester. If this is an emergency, leave a message. If you are calling about 11-2-83, page me with your coordinates."[133] The second season episode "Tall Tales" featured a tie-in to that week's issue of the tabloid newspaper Weekly World News. The February 19 and March 19, 2007, editions of the paper featured exclusive interviews with Sam and Dean, the articles being written by Paul Kupperberg.[134][135]Supernatural has a vast amount of merchandise available, including calendars, t-shirts, shot glasses, and posters.[136] CineQuest.com has released sculpted hand-painted resin mini-busts of numerous characters from the series, including Sam, Dean, and John Winchester, the titular villain from the episode "Scarecrow", and the Woman in White from the pilot episode. The company also plans on developing 12-inch figures.[136] Inkworks has released trading cards for the show, some cards featuring actors' autographs and swatches from actual costumes used on the series.[137][138][139] Also, a Supernatural pen and paper roleplaying game was developed by Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd.[140] Originally scheduled for release in the October 2007,[141] it was delayed until August 2009.[142] The game uses material from the series, novels, and comics.[141] Additionally, on September 7, 2010, Watertower Music released Supernatural: Original Television Soundtrack Seasons 1-5. It features 18 original tracks by Supernatural series composer's Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska. *Amazon.comFurther information on the series' mythology and production have been detailed through print. Official companion guides for the first six seasons have been released (ISBN 1845765354, ISBN 1-84576-657-1, ISBN 1-84856-103-2, ISBN 1-84856-738-3, ISBN 1-84856-739-1, ISBN 0-85768-289-X), all written by Nicholas Knight and published by Titan Books. Two additional guides written by Alex Irvine, The "Supernatural" Book of Monsters, Spirits, Demons, and Ghouls (ISBN 0-06-136703-6) and John Winchester's Journal (ISBN 0-06-170662-0), have been published by It Books. Irvine's books function as resource guides that contain illustrations and detailed descriptions of the supernatural creatures the Winchester family has encountered, giving additional background on creatures and mythology featured on the show. Premiering on November 27, 2007, was the Official Supernatural Magazine.[143] Published by Titan Magazines,[144] it contains series information and exclusive cast and crew interviews.[143] It Books published Supernatural: Bobby Singer's Guide to Hunting by David Reed on September 6, 2011 (ISBN 0062103377), sharing all the knowledge that the character Bobby Singer had to share about hunting, the Winchesters, and other knowledge he picked up over the years dealing with the elements of the supernatural.The series has also developed an expanded universe. Three six-issue comic book mini-series have been published by Wildstorm,[145] a company under the DC Comics umbrella. Supernatural: Origins depicts the early lives of John, Sam, and Dean Winchester, and shows how John became a hunter.[146] Supernatural: Rising Son, a "a dysfunctional family story", details Dean as he begins following in his father's footsteps.[147] While Kripke was heavily involved with the first series, the writer's strike prevented him from doing so with Rising Son.[147] Supernatural: Beginning's End deals with "the definitive events that led to Sam leaving his family to attend Stanford". The first two miniseries were written by Peter Johnson, one of the series co-executive producer, while the third one is by television series writers Andrew Dabb and Daniel Loflin.[148]A fourth miniseries, Caledonia, by Brian Wood and Grant Bond, will deal with Sam Winchester's trip to the United Kingdom during the Stanford years.[149]Several novels based on the series have also been published.An unofficial anthology entitled In the Hunt: Unauthorized Essays on Supernatural (ISBN 1933771631) was released on February 10, 2009 by Smart Pop and featured essays covering different aspects of both the series and its fanbase. The Mythology of Supernatural: The Signs and Symbols Behind the Popular TV Show (ISBN 0425241378), published by Berkley Trade on August 2, 2011, sought to explore the religious and mythological roots of the show. And on October 1, 2011, ECW Press released the book TV Goes to Hell: An Unofficial Road Map of Supernatural (ISBN 1770410201) which explored topics such as folklore, religion, gender and sexuality, comedy, and music through essays from a number of contributors.The growing popularity of "amateur spook-hunters" Ed Zeddmore and Harry Spangler prompted Kripke to consider a spin-off series for the characters. He discussed the idea of an online venture with actors A. J. Buckley and Travis Wester, and held a successful meeting with studio and network executives.[150] Though Kripke announced their plans to produce "some new material, either webisodes, potentially cell phone content or basically an off-network Ghostfacers series" at the 2008 Comic-Con,[151] the economic downturn delayed production until 2009.[150]Buckley and Wester, along with Patrick J. Doody and Chris Valenziano, penned the series.[150] They found the formatten three-minute segments[152]difficult to manage because each webisode has to work both individually and as part of the overall storyline.[150] However, Wester noted, "We couldn't get too indulgent, we couldn't delve into long conversations. That helps not only with the storytelling but with the comedy... With drama, it takes time to establish an emotional connection with the characters. With comedy, you can jump right in."[150]Though an initial idea of Kripke's involved the cast searching real haunted houses,[151] the first season instead features the Ghostfacers investigating a haunted theater. The series also stars Brittany Ishibashi as Maggie and Austin Basis as Spruce. Buckley shares a manager with Kelly Carlson, and she accepted the guest role of the ghostly actress Janet within half an hour of reading the script.[152]On October 23, 2011 A. J. Buckley posted on his Twitter account[153] a link to a special webisode in which the Ghostfacers meet Castiel,[154] first shown during the Hell Hounds 2009 Con.On June 9, 2010, the official Japanese Warner Bros. website announced an anime version of the series entitled Supernatural: The Animation, which debuted in Japan in January 2011[155] and is produced by famed Japanese anime studio Madhouse.[156] Shigeyuki Miya and Atsuko Ishizuka are co-directors for the series, with Kripke credited as the project creator.[157] Madhouse co-founder Masao Maruyama serves as executive producer, with Naoya Takayama supervising the scripts and Takahiro Yoshimatsu designing the characters. Yya Uchida and Hiroki Touchi, who voice Sam and Dean for the Japanese dub of the live-action series, reprise their roles.[156]The anime's first season consists of 22episodes; while the storyline covers the first two seasons of the live-action series, it also includes original content exploring the Winchesters' childhoods and expanding upon secondary characters.[156] Warner Home Video released the first two episodes on Blu-ray and DVD in Japan on January 12, 2011; episodes 3 through 12 shipped on February 2, and the rest on April 6.[156] Warner Home Video released the Blu-ray and DVD box sets of the anime series on July 26, 2011 in North America.[158]Jared Padalecki voices Sam in the English language version of the series, while Jensen Ackles voices Dean only in the last two episodes due to scheduling reasons; Andrew Farrar voices Dean in English for the first 20 episodes.During production of Supernatural's third season, Kripke stated that the writers sometimes discussed the possibility of a prequel series. Set in the Old West, the spin-off would follow Samuel Colt and a group of hunters.[16]Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of Supernatural on The WB and The CW (some including repeats).After the first four episodes of Supernatural aired in 2005, the WB decided to pick up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. During those first episodes, the series was ranked third in males aged 1834 and 1234. It also posted an increase of 73% in males aged 1849 from the year before, although it only gained 4% in total viewers, and retained 91% of viewers from its lead-in, Gilmore Girls.[170] Supernatural had low ratings during its second season, with viewers consisting mainly of teen girls, and the CW trying to attract more male viewers.[171] The show's future was in doubt at the end of the second season.[172] Despite mediocre ratings in the previous year, it was back for a third season.[173] Although its third season's rating were low, it did well with viewers aged 1849. In this category, it ranked eighth of all returning series broadcast by a major network.[174] The show received an early pickup for its fourth season.[175] The shows ratings increased in its fourth season.[176] The fourth season premiere aired on September 18, 2008, averaging its highest rating ever since its debut on The CW Network with 3.96 million viewers, a 33% surge over the season three premiere and a 1.7/5 in adults 1849, up 42% from one year earlier.[177] On October 16, 2008, the show was watched by 3.06 million viewers, making the lowest rating for the season. On October 30, 2008, the show climbed to its best performance in adults 1834 (1.4/4), adults 1849 (1.5/4) and total viewers (3.6mil) since its season premiere on September 18, 2008.[178] For the fifth season premiere, viewership increased by 6% in women 18-34 (1.7/5) over the fourth season premiere.[179] However, taking DVR viewings into account with new Live-Plus 7 Day data, total viewership for the premiere increased 38%, with women 18-34 increasing by 35% and adults 18-34 by 47%.[180]Writer Raelle Tucker, received the Constellation Award for "Best Overall 2007 Science Fiction Film or Television Script" for the second season episode "What Is and What Should Never Be".[181] Work on the pilot episode garnered two Emmy Award nominations in 2006, composer Christopher Lennertz being nominated in the category of "Outstanding Music Composition For A Series (Dramatic Underscore)"[181][182] and the sound editors[note 6] receiving a nomination for "Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series".[183] The sound editors[note 7] received a nomination for the latter award once again in 2008 for the third season episode "Jus In Bello".[181][unreliable source?] The pilot episode also brought in a nomination for a Golden Reel Award in the category of "Best Sound Editing in Television: Short Form Sound Effects and Foley",[184] with work on the first season episode "Salvation" and the second season episode "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part 2" gaining the same nomination in 2007[185] and 2008,[186] respectively. Additionally, the series has been nominated for a Saturn Award in the category of "Best Network Television Series" in 2006,[187] 2008,[188] and 2009.[189] Several nominations have been through the Teen Choice Awards, the series being nominated for "TV Choice Breakout Show"[190] and Jensen Ackles for "TV Choice Breakout Star" in 2006.[190] Several years later, the series was nominated for the 2010 "Choice TV Show: Fantasy/Sci-Fi".[191] Jared Padalecki received a nomination for the category of "Choice TV Actor: Drama" in 2007.[192] In 2009, the series was nominated for a People's Choice Award for "Favorite Sci-Fi / Fantasy Show",[193] as well as a GLAAD Media Award in the category of "Outstanding Individual Episode (in a series without a regular LGBT character)" for the third season episode "Ghostfacers";[194] it would go on to win the former award in 2010.[195] The guest cast of the series has also been nominated many times. In 2007, Colby Paul was nominated for a Young Artist Award in the category of "Best Performance in a TV Series (Comedy or Drama) - Guest Starring Young Actor",[196] followed in 2008 by Nicholas Elia for "Best Performance in a TV Series Guest Starring Young Actor" for the third season episode "The Kids Are Alright" and Conchita Campbell for "Best Performance in a TV Series Guest Starring Young Actress" for the second season episode "Playthings".[197] Jessica Harmon gained a nomination in 2008 for a Leo Award in category of "Best Guest Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series" for the second season episode "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part 1",[198] as did Mandy Playdon the following year for the fourth season episode "Family Remains".[199] In 2010, the Constellation Awards nominated Jensen Ackles and Misha Collins for Best Male Performance in a 2009 Science Fiction Television Episode (for the fifth season episodes "The End" and "The Rapture", respectively), Alona Tal for Best Female Performance in a 2009 Science Fiction Television Episode (for the fifth season episode "Abandon All Hope"), and Supernatural for Best Science Fiction Television Series of 2009.[200] The series also won the People's Choice Award 2010 for Favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Show.[201] In the tail end of 2010, Supernatural won the cover of TV Guide Magazine, with fans casting over five million votes.[202] The 2012 People's Choice Awards for both Favorite Network Drama and Favorite SciFi/Fantasy Series went to Supernatural.[203]Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly gave the first season a B, saying the show "comes off as weekly installments of a horror movie series", but that "Adding to the show's cred are the '67 Chevy Impala the boys rumble around in and their kick-ass soundtrack".[204] Jeff Swindoll of Monsters and Critics "really liked" the first season[205] due to its "horrific content and the brotherly chemistry between its two stars". He also noted that the season finished "with one bang of a cliffhanger".[206] Swindoll enjoyed the second season, too, saying that it "still works thanks to the brotherly chemistry between Padalecki and Ackles" and noted the second season focused more on the show's mythology.[205]Swindoll also liked the third season, saying "Eric Kripke must've sold his soul to the devil so that the show wouldn't suffer a third season slump." He also enjoyed the moments featuring Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver), likening him to the character Cooter from Dukes of Hazzard.[207] However, Daniel Bettridge of Den of Geek! believed that the writer's strike hindered the season, with many issues being left unresolved and the finale feeling "a little rushed". He also felt that new characters Ruby (Katie Cassidy) and Bela (Lauren Cohan) were "disappointingly unexplored and ineffectively used".[208] While Diana Steenbergen of IGN liked that there was a season-long story arc with Dean's demonic deal, she believed that viewers would know that the pact would not be resolved until the finale, making the self-enclosed episodes feel like they are "treading water, waiting for the main storyline to resume".[209] In 2008, AOL TV placed the show on its list of TV's Biggest Guilty Pleasures.[210]Another Monsters and Critics reviewer, June L., gave the fourth season a positive review, saying the show "remains intriguing and entertaining, giving viewers much to ponder in terms of the philosophical analysis of the nature of good and evil."[211] Steenbergen felt that the series made a transition from a "pretty good show to being a pretty great show". She praised Misha Collins for his portrayal of the angel Castiel, and felt that the interactions between Dean and Castiel were "one of the highlights of the season".[212] Before the premiere of the fifth season, Rolling Stone listed the series as one of "The 50 Best Reasons to Watch TV", citing Sam and Dean Winchester as the "Bo and Luke Duke of demon hunting".[213]The Chicago Tribune's Maureen Ryan named Supernatural among the top ten shows of 2009, stating that the "thoughtfully crafted show got bolder and more creative in 2009, coming up with hilarious and innovative episodes and taking risks with its storytelling."[214] Mike Hale of The New York Times also named the series on his top ten list for the year: "Supernatural is currently among the wildest and most entertaining series in prime time."[215]In 2012, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at #19 in the "25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years," saying, "Supernatural began with a pretty straightforward premise - hot guys kill spooky things - but it didn't stay that way for long. The characters have literally been to hell and back, and along the way, they have woven a complicated and compelling mythology filled with friends (angel Castiel), recurring foes (demon Crowley), and inside jokes (Wincest!). Supernatural has also, however, dedicated episodes to mocking the sillier aspects of its own existence, like its hypercritical fandom. This self-referential approach has rewarded longtime viewers and helped build a community so passionate, it's almost scary."[216]On January 4, 2010, the cable television network TNT began airing reruns of Supernatural. The show is broadcast on weekdays at 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. ET, and began with the pilot episode, which was most recently aired on April 20, 2012.[217]Being a cult series, Supernatural has garnered a dedicated fanbase.[218][219] They are active online,[220] and many have written fanfiction stories about the show, with a portion of the writers dedicated to stories involving a sexual relationship between Sam and Dean Winchesterknown as "Wincest". The writers have jokingly referenced this several times in the series.[221][222] On November 3, 2011, Misha Collins appeared on the podcast Disasterpiece Theatre to discuss what a Supernatural "Wincest" movie might look like.[223]The first fan conventions dedicated to Supernatural took place in Nashville, Tennessee, in October 2006[224] and in London in May 2007,[225] and conventions have since expanded through to Germany and throughout the United States. The series' stars and large guest cast make appearances,[226][227][228][229] with fans from the United States, Europe, China, and Australia attending.[40]Before the debut of the series' fifth season, in which Lucifer is finally freed from his imprisonment, fans attempted to promote the show through the website Twitter. Enough fans posted the hash tag "#LuciferIsComing" that it made it into "trending topics"[230][231]a list depicting words and phrases posted with the highest frequency on the website.[232] However, Twitter users who were unaware of the fans' intentions responded with numerous posts of "#GodIsHere", and all the messages were eventually removed due to complaints. Actor Misha Collins, who portrays Castiel in the series, tried to continue the campaign by requesting that fans post "#PDiddyIsScaredOfHisTV", rapper P. Diddy being the one whom many fans believe to be the instigator of the initial backlash.[230][231] However, after an hour, these messages were also blocked.[233]Supernatural at TV.com1 Production

The show was created by Tom Kapinos. Hank Moody (David Duchovny) is a troubled novelist who moves to California and suffers from writer's block which complicates his relationships with his longtime girlfriend Karen (Natascha McElhone) and daughter Becca (Madeleine Martin). Californication's other main characters are Charlie Runkle (Evan Handler), Marcy Runkle (Pamela Adlon), and Mia Cross (Madeline Zima). The show has been nominated for and has won several awards, including winning one Emmy Award (nominated for two others) and one Golden Globe Award (nominated for three others). Californication has aired for five complete seasons. Due to strong ratings for the third season premiere, Showtime renewed the show early for a fourth season.[1] Season four began filming in April 2010 and premiered January 9, 2011. The fifth season premiered on Sunday, January 8, 2012.[2] The show was renewed for a sixth season on February 1, 2013.[3]The series revolves around Hank Moody, a novelist plagued by personal demons. He blames his longtime writer's block on reasons ranging from the hedonism of Los Angeles to the departure of his girlfriend Karen. Hank constantly deals with the consequences of his inability to say "no" to drugs, sex, and alcohol while trying to show his family that he can be a good, responsible, caring father to Becca and a monogamous partner to Karen.The show was renewed for a second season on September 7, 2007.[4] The season 1 finale, titled "The Last Waltz" (in homage to Martin Scorsese's concert film[5]), originally aired on Showtime on October 29, 2007. Season 2 began filming in April 2008,[6] and was underway as of June 2008.[7] The premiere episode of season 2 aired September 28, 2008. The first season was released on DVD in the US on June 17, 2008. Showtime renewed Californication for a third season,[8] which premiered on Sunday September 27, 2009 at 10 pm.The show is laced with rock culture references. It frequently alludes to Warren Zevon and featured Henry Rollins in a guest appearance; and some episode titles, such as "Filthy Lucre" and "Turn The Page", allude to album and song names (Sex Pistols' "Filthy Lucre Live" and Bob Seger's "Turn the Page", respectively). In addition, Hank's lawyer in season 4 is called Abby Rhodes, and his first three novels, "South of Heaven", "Seasons In The Abyss" and "God Hates Us All," are named after Slayer albums.[5]Season 1 (August 13  October 29, 2007) followed Hank and the other main characters in the months leading up to Karen's planned marriage to Bill, a Los Angeles publisher. Hank wallows deep in self-loathing following the release of A Crazy Little Thing Called Love, a drastically altered and watered-downyet commercially popularmovie adaptation of his most recent novel, God Hates Us All.[9]Hank spends most of his time drinking and not writing. One day he picks up a younger woman in a bookstore; after they have sex, he discovers that she's Bill's 16-year-old daughter Mia. Mia proceeds to harass Hank during his visits to his family, and she uses the threat of illegal sex charges to extort stories from him that she passes off as her own for her high-school creative-writing class.Hank's father's death triggers an alcohol-fueled binge and a sexual encounter with Karen. After the funeral, Hank stays in New York to finish a manuscript for a new novella. But upon returning to L.A., he believes the original copy to be lost when he is carjacked. Mia, however, had previously copied the original, and now she takes credit for it herself. On Karen and Bill's wedding day, Hank chooses to accept the situation, but as he and Becca leave the reception, Karen runs out and jumps into his car, presumably to resume their life together.On June 3, 2008, Showtime released the season-one soundtrack Temptation: Music From The Showtime Series Californication, which features music from the original series. Included artists are The Rolling Stones, Peeping Tom, My Morning Jacket, The Doors, Tommy Stinson, Bob Dylan, Harvey Danger, Madeleine Martin, Gus Black, Mexican institute of sound, Warren Zevon, The Heavy, Champion, Steve Earle, Elton John, and two original tracks created for the show by Tyler Bates and Tree Adams.In Season 2 (September 28  December 14, 2008), Hank and Karen's resumed relationship seems to be working out, Becca seems happy again, and their house is on the market. Hank gets a vasectomy and attends a party thrown by Sonja, a woman he had sex with in Season 1. A mistake and a fight with an obnoxious police officer land Hank in jail, where he meets world-famous record producer Lew Ashby, who commissions Hank to write his biography.Too-frequent office masturbation costs Charlie Runkle his job. He decides to go into the porn industry, becomes the agent/paternal-figure of a porn star named Daisy, and spends the majority of his and his wife Marcy's nest egg financing the artsy porn movie Vaginatown (a take on Chinatown), starring Daisy. Marcy goes into rehab for her cocaine addiction, and Charlie starts an affair with Daisy. Hank proposes to Karen on the night they discover Hank could be the father of Sonja's child. Karen decides they can't be together and refuses his proposal, leading him to go back to his old wayscontinuing the show's centrality on clandestine sexuality.Hank moves in with Ashby, whoto Hank's dismaystarts a romance with Mia. Becca finds boyfriend named Damien. Mia's book is a hit and Ashby holds a party in its and her honor, where Damien cheats on Becca and Charlie decides to leave Marcy for Daisy. After the party, Hank sees that Ashby's old girlfriend (The One That Got Away) has finally resurfaced...but when Hank goes looking for Ashby upstairs, he is dying from snorting heroin he had mistaken for cocaine.Hank finishes Ashby's biography. Charlie ends up working in a the Valley BMW dealership, introducing himself as Chuck Runkle. Sonja's baby arrives; it is biracial, which proves that Hank cannot be the father. Hank and Karen slowly move toward reuniting. Karen is offered a job in New York and Hank is happy to go back there with her, but when Damien apologizes to Becca and they reconcile, Hank decides it would be wrong to take Becca out of L.A. and stays there with her while Karen starts her job in New York. The season closes with Karen's plane leaving for New York and Hank and Becca walking on the Venice boardwalk.Season 3 (September 27  December 13, 2009)[8] began where Season 2 ended. Key elements include Hank becoming a teacher, the various shenanigans he gets into when let loose on a college campus, and his ongoing relationship with his daughter Becca.The father-daughter relationship between Hank and Becca becomes decidedly moodier as she progresses through her teenage years, and Hank kept questioning his fatherhood ability as he watched his daughter become more like him than he ever wanted. He also continued to complicate his relationship with Becca's mother, his longtime love Karen, with various relationships with females of all ages.In the season finale, Hank has recurring nightmares of floating in a pool, drinking heavily while talking to his most recent conquests, who are swimming naked around him; Karen and Becca watch poolside. In reality, Mia returns to Hank's home and invites the family to the media launch of the paperback edition of her book. At the afterparty, Hank meets Mia's manager. Also her new boyfriend, he knows of Mia's history with Hank and offers Hank a way out by coming clean to the press about how the novel came about. But as it will affect Karen and Becca, Hank must decline. When they meet again, the men break into a fight and the manager/boyfriend threatens to call the police. Hank hurries home to Karen and tells her that he slept with Mia in season one. Karen breaks down uncontrollably, the argument bursts onto the street, and a police car arrives as Hank is trying to calm Karen. When one of the two officers grabs Hank from behind, Hank belts him and is bundled into the back of the car as Becca runs out to try to stop the police. The final scene shows a dream sequence of Hank in the pool again, drinking out of the bottle. He falls from his seat and drops his drink. The last shot shows Hank sinking while the bottle remains in shot.Season 4 (January 9, 2011  March 27, 2011)[10] filming began on April 19, 2010. Guest stars included Carla Gugino as Hank's lawyer Abby; Zo Kravitz as Becca's new friend who gets her to join her all-girl band, Queens of Dogtown;[11] Addison Timlin as Sasha Bingham, a movie star; and Rob Lowe as Eddy Nero, a famous actor who wants to play Hank's character in a movie. Zakk Wylde, singer and guitarist for Black Label Society and former guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne, has a cameo as a guitar-shop employee in episode 2, the title of which, "Suicide Solution", comes from the Ozzy Osbourne song. Michael Ealy played a new love interest for Karen in 4 episodes, and Madeline Zima returned as Mia for 4 episodes.Season four picks up 72 hours after Hank is arrested at the end of Season 3 and revolves around Hank's thoroughly destroyed life. His secrets have come to light and the world knows that he penned Fucking & Punching, also revealing that he slept with Mia. Karen hates Hank and Becca is disappointed in her father, so he goes to live at a hotel. Season four follows his new legal troubles, such as his lawyer's attempts to get him acquitted of statutory-rape charges, and the development of a film adaption of "Fucking & Punching", and the various troubles he causes with the production. Other developing storylines include Charlie learning his vasectomy may have been botched and he may have impregnated Marcy, Becca joining an all female rock band, and Karen finding a new boyfriend.On January 11, 2011 the Californication Season 4 Soundtrack was released[12] The soundtrack features music in Season Four of Californication. Exclusive tracks include Tommy Lees solo version of Home Sweet Home and three rock covers from the shows on-screen band Queens of Dogtown. Other artists on the soundtrack are Shooter Jennings & Hierophant, Eagles of Death Metal, Better Than Ezra, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, Monster Magnet vs. Adrian Young, Cracker, The Soundtrack of Our Lives, Warren Zevon, and Gregory Alan Isakov.[13] The soundtrack was co-produced by Nora Felder and Budd Carr, the shows music supervisors.[14]The show returned to Showtime for its fifth season in January 2012.[15] Creator Tom Kapinos said[citation needed] that the show needed to take on a new direction to stay fresh. The narrative takes place 2 years and 9 months after season four, almost at the end of Hank's probation. Hank has since made New York his home, but he returns to Los Angeles for a business-related visit which family issues end up extending. Karen is married to Professor Bates, 19-year-old Becca is in college and has a new boyfriend, and Marcy is married to Stu Beggs and sharing custody of her son Stuart with Charlie.The sixth season is currently in production and will feature a storyline revolving around Hank penning a musical with "cocked up rock star" Atticus Fetch (Tim Minchin). The sixth season will also feature rock star Marilyn Manson in a role. Californication will return Sunday, January 13, 2013 at 10:30PM ET/PT[citation needed]The critical reaction for Californication has been generally favorable, with a rating of 70 on Metacritic.[17] However, American critic Nathan Rabin gave Season 1 an "F" rating on The AV Club, calling it "insufferable."[18]There has been a backlash from conservative groups who oppose the explicit nature of the program. Conservative columnist Andrew Bolt criticized the program in the Australian newspaper the Herald Sun for the pilot's opening dream scene, in which a nun performs oral sex on Hank Moody in a church.[19] The Australian Christian Lobbys managing director Jim Wallace also called for a boycott, not only of Network Ten, but all advertisers who advertise during the show, in response to a scene in which Hank and Sonja smoke marijuana, have sex, and vomit.[20] When Network Ten premiered Season 2, the Christian fundamentalist[21][22][23] group Salt Shakers led an e-mail campaign against advertisers, requesting they withdraw their advertisements. This resulted in 49 companies withdrawing their advertising, including the show's main sponsor, Just Car Insurance.The show and the lead actor, David Duchovny, were both nominated for Golden Globes in 2007; Duchovny won the lead actor award, but the award for best TV series in this category went to Extras.[24]American Cinema Editors (ACE)BAFTA Television AwardsCasting Society of AmericaEmmy AwardsGolden Globe AwardsPGA AwardsPrism AwardsSatellite AwardsScreen Actors Guild AwardsThe Red Hot Chili Peppers filed a lawsuit on November 19, 2007[29] against Showtime Networks over the name of the series, which is also the name of the band's 1999 album and hit single. They state in the lawsuit that the series "constitutes a false designation of origin, and has caused and continues to cause a likelihood of confusion, mistake, and deception as to source, sponsorship, affiliation, and/or connection in the minds of the public".[30] Pointing to Dani California, a character who appears in both the series and three songs by the Red Hot Chili Peppers (including Californication) as well as confusion when shopping for their album and that of the series soundtrack, the band members are seeking unspecified damages. They are also requesting that a new name be found for the TV show.[30]Showtime Networks is expected to argue that the band did not in fact create the term Californication. They point out that the term appeared in print in Time magazine in 1972, in an article called The Great Wild Californicated West,[31] while show producer Tom Kapinos cites the inspiration as coming from a bumper sticker he saw in the '70s that read "Don't Californicate Oregon".[5][32] Canadian art-rock band the Rheostatics released an album called Whale Music in 1992, with a song called "California Dreamline". In this song, the word Californication appears in the phrase "Californication, spooning in the dry sand".[31][33]Kim Walker, head of intellectual property at Pinsent Masons, states that the band should have registered Californication as a trademark. Instead, the only application for such was filed in April 2007 in the US, by Showtime. The mark has not yet been registered. Walker has also stated:Successful songs, albums and movies can become brands in themselves. What's really surprising is how few songs and albums are properly protected... The Chili Peppers could almost certainly have registered a trade mark for 'Californication', notwithstanding Time's article. They made the word famous, but it doesn't automatically follow that they can stop its use in a TV show.

If they had registered the title as a trade mark covering entertainment services, I very much doubt we'd have seen a lawsuit. The TV show would have been called something else. As it is, the band faces an uphill struggle.[30]In the United States, character names and titles of works are only subject to trademark protection, not copyright protection.[34] The legal matter remains unresolved.The Season 2 finale drew 615,000 viewers, with a combined total of 937,000 for the evening, retaining less than 50% of its lead-in from the season finale of Dexter. However, Season 3 steadily gained viewership, and the show was quickly picked up for a fourth season by Showtime.[35]Californication at TV.com1 Series overview

While trying to live as normal a life as possibleshe is married and owns an antique storeMelinda helps earthbound spirits resolve their problems and cross over into the light, or the spirit world. Her tasks are difficult and at times she struggles with people who push her away and disbelieve her ability. In addition, the ghosts are mysterious and sometimes menacing in the beginning and Melinda must use the clues available to her to understand the spirits' needs and help them.[3] The show was created by John Gray and was produced by Sander/Moses Productions, executive producer, and Jennifer Love Hewitt in association with ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.[4] On May 18, 2010, CBS canceled the show after five seasons.[5]Melinda Gordon is a young woman from the fictional town of Grandview, New York who has the ability to see and communicate with the dead. Melinda lives with her husband, Jim Clancy (David Conrad), and eventually her son, Aiden Lucas (Connor Gibbs). She owns a shop called "Same As It Never Was Antiques". Ghosts seek Melinda's help in relaying a message or completing a task that will put the spirit to rest, and allow them to cross over into the light. Those who died with unfinished business become earthbound and cannot cross over, and Melinda, as their earthly representative, helps them to find peace. The show does not present the ghosts as having sinned; rather it is the spirits' own guilt that condemns them, and their own fear of judgment that keeps them from "crossing over" into an afterlife.The series also starred Aisha Tyler as Andrea Marino, Melinda's best friend who runs the antique shop with her. Andrea is tragically killed in the first season finale. During the second season, Melinda meets Delia Banks (Camryn Manheim), a struggling real estate agent who forms a friendship with Melinda and who eventually agrees to run the antique shop with her. Delia is shocked to find out about Melinda's abilities; in fact, at first she claims Melinda needs psychological help. Delia eventually accepts Melinda's gift, though she remains skeptical at times. Delia has a son named Ned Banks (Tyler Patrick Jones seasons 2-3, Christoph Sanders thereafter) who finds out about Melinda's gift long before his mother does.Melinda also forms a friendship with Rick Payne (Jay Mohr), a professor at Rockland University. He helps Melinda solve the conflicts of ghosts throughout the second and third seasons. He departs in the fourth season premiere for an expedition in the Himalayas.Ghost Whisperer is based on the work of James Van Praagh,[6] who is co-executive producer.[7] The stories are also said to be based in part on the work of Mary Ann Winkowski.[8] Development of the show dates back to at least two years before its premiere.[9]The show was produced by Sander/Moses Productions in association with CBS Television Studios (originally Paramount Network Television in season one and ABC Studios (originally Touchstone Television in the first two seasons) and CBS Paramount Network Television in seasons two and three).The show was filmed on the Universal Studios back lot in Los Angeles.[10] One area on the lot is Courthouse Square from the Back to the Future trilogy, though it has been drastically modified to depict Grandview. For example, the clock tower in Back to the Future has been completely covered up. The front of Melinda and Jim's house is also the same set used by the Finch family in the film adaptation of To Kill A Mockingbird. Cast and crew members said they believed that the set got visits from real spirits.[11] After the show's cancellation and shortly before the sets were torn down, Jennifer Love Hewitt filmed a tour demonstrating the ways in which the areas were different from those shown in the TV broadcast.[12]Sound effects were completed at Smart Post Sound.[13] Visual effects for the pilot and some season one episodes were completed at Flash Film Works.[14] Visual effects for nearly the entire series were created at Eden FX.[15]Creator John Gray grew up in Brooklyn, New York, which is not far from Grand View-On-Hudson (also called Grand View), west of the Hudson River. Piermont is often referenced in episodes as the neighboring town, which is accurate to real life as Grand View is actually located just north of Piermont. Professor Rick Payne worked at the fictional "Rockland University", and perhaps not coincidentally, the actual village of Grand View is a village located in Rockland County, New York.The first season premiered on September 23, 2005 and ended on May 5, 2006. It has received an average of 10.20 million viewers. Season two of Ghost Whisperer premiered on September 22, 2006 and ended on May 11, 2007, again airing Friday nights on CBS during the same timeslot.[citation needed] CBS officially renewed the show for a third season placing it in its regular Friday 8 p.m. ET time slot. The third season premiered September 28, 2007. Twelve episodes were completed before the Writers Guild of America strike, and once the strike ended, CBS had announced that the show would return April 4, 2008 with 6 episodes.[16] On February 15, 2008, CBS renewed Ghost Whisperer for a fourth season.[17] For the fourth season, Jamie Kennedy joined the cast as Psychology professor Eli James. Jay Mohr left after the first episode as the plot had his character, Professor Rick Payne, going on sabbatical (Mohr took a role in Gary Unmarried).[18] Recurring cast member Christoph Sanders joined as a regular cast member. The fourth season of Ghost Whisperer premiered on Friday, October 3, 2008 and concluded on May 15, 2009 and consisted of 23 episodes.[19][20] In an interview by P.K. Simonds with E! Online, it was announced that that Ghost Whisperer would return for a fifth season.[21] CBS renewed Ghost Whisperer for the fifth season on May 20, 2009, which began airing on Friday, September 25, 2009 at 8pm ET and ran for 22 episodes.[22][23]On May 5, 2008 it was announced that the first three seasons of Ghost Whisperer were purchased for $169.8 million ($700,000 per episode, per network) for syndication by SyFy, ION Television, and WE TV. Episodes began airing in Summer 2009 on ION, and in Fall 2009 on SyFy and WE.[24] The first four seasons began airing in syndication on CBC Television in Canada on August 31, 2009.[25]On May 18, 2010, citing rising costs and a decline in viewership, CBS announced that Ghost Whisperer would not be renewed for another season.[5] ABC expressed interest in picking up Ghost Whisperer for Fall 2010;[26][27] however, on May 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello reported that ABC had passed on renewing Ghost Whisperer for a sixth season.[28]Zap2it declared Ghost Whisperer is the second "most missed axed show" after a poll determined 18.8 percent of voters would miss it.[29]In October 2010, Jennifer Love Hewitt thanked the fans of the show for their support in a goodbye video (filmed in June, 2010), saying "Your love and support has meant everything to the cast and crew of Ghost Whisperer and we will all miss you guys very, very much. Go get our DVDs, think about us, miss us and know how much we all will miss you. Much love."[12]In January 2011, Hewitt told the press of her opinion about the cancellation, saying "When youve taken people on a journey for so long, the least you can do is give them a goodbye. For a show that was about unfinished business, we didnt get to finish."[30]
Episodes in the first half of the fourth season won their time slot every week in viewers, and across all age demographics, including the 1849 age bracket, and also usually won the night for CBS as the most-watched show on Friday nights.[31] Furthermore, fourteen episodes from Season 4 surpassed 10 million viewers, with another seven surpassing 11 million viewers, a remarkable feat in what is considered the Friday night death slot.[32]Ghost Whisperer: The Other Side is a series of webisodes released on the Ghost Whisperer website.[33] A total of eight webisodes were produced and extras (such as trailers and behind the scenes) are available for viewing. The story follows Zach (played by Mark Hapka), a young delivery boy who dies while delivering a package. He soon learns how to do things in the spirit world, and gets revenge on Danny, the man he thinks killed him, and his former best friend.Melinda from the television series doesn't appear in the internet series as it takes place entirely in the spirit world. However, ghosts from the television series have appeared in some webisodes. In the second season finale of Ghost Whisperer, Zach made an appearance while trying to get help from Melinda before being taken into the Dark Side leaving the internet series in its own cliffhanger. The second season of The Other Side premiered on the LivingTV website on January 18, 2008.[33] Season 3 deals with Zach trying to help his high school crush Olivia find true love as her ex soon to be husband does not love her.andshamethedevil.net[34] is a site linked to Ghost Whisperer. The site is mentioned in the Season 3 premiere. By clicking on the star in the upper right hand corner, the site appears to crack into pieces. Those pieces can be moved by dragging, revealing this message: "Meet Me In The Underworld". Small type at the bottom of the page read the repeated words: "bloody mary. bloody mary. bloody mary." Also clicking on the word 'bloody', it leads to another site rubloodymary.com. There is a hidden message under the graphic. By holding down the mouse key and dragging it around, a new image will appear along with the message. andshamethedevil.net is no longer used as promotion for the show and has since been turned into an unrelated advertising blog, although rubloodymary.com can still be accessed by typing the address into an address box in an internet browser.In the series, penthius.info is often used by Melinda to look up information about the families and ghosts that she is investigating in Grandview. A real world version of this site was created in February 2008. The site description read: "Penthius.Info is a free search engine and video super site based on the search engine in the television series The Ghost Whisperer with Jennifer Love Hewitt." It was first mentioned in a post on TV.com by misscalais,[35] a fan who created the site to promote the show.In July 2009, Legacy Interactive announced a licensing agreement with CBS Consumer Products to develop a video game based on the Ghost Whisperer television series. The game is set to debut on the PC and Mac and include characters and themes from the show.[36] On November 1, 2010, a developer diary was posted on the game's website, detailing areas in the game and confirming that Melinda, Jim, Delia and Eli will feature. The release date, which was initially early 2010, was changed to 2011 and the subtitle announced in the original press release, Shadowlands, was dropped from the game.[37] It was released on April 19, 2011, exclusively at Wal-Mart.The Region 1 DVD releases are distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment/CBS DVD, while releases in all other regions are distributed by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (formerly Buena Vista Home Entertainment).1 Premise2 Production

The series was created by Todd J. Greenwald, and stars Selena Gomez, David Henrie and Jake T. Austin as three wizard siblings with magical abilities competing to win sole custody of the family powers. Further main cast includes Jennifer Stone, Mara Canals Barrera and David DeLuise.The series won "Outstanding Children's Program" at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in 2009. A film adaptation of the series, Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie, premiered as a Disney Channel Original Movie on August 28, 2009. The film adaptation won "Outstanding Children's Program" at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards earning the series its second consecutive Emmy. The farewell season won "Outstanding Children's Program" at the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards bringing the franchise's total to three Emmy awards. Wizards of Waverly Place ended as the longest-running Disney Channel Original Series (surpassing That's So Raven) with 106 episodes over four seasons. Its series finale averaged nearly 10 million viewers (live+same day), which made that episode the most-watched series finale in Disney Channel's history.On September 27, 2012, Disney Channel announced that Wizards of Waverly Place will be returning in 2013 for a special one-hour television event,[1][2][3] which began production on October 22, 2012, and ended production on November 10, 2012. [4]Wizards of Waverly Place chronicles the adventures of the Italian-Mexican Russo Family. The Russos live on Waverly Place in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, above a sub shop which they own and run. The family consists of siblings Alexandra "Alex" (Selena Gomez), Justin (David Henrie), and Maximillian "Max" (Jake T. Austin). The three teenagers are wizards and live with their Italian father, Jerry (David DeLuise), a former family wizard, and their mortal Mexican mother, Theresa (Maria Canals Barrera). When the Russo siblings complete their wizard training, they are to participate in a competition to decide who will become the Family Wizard (the one to keep his/her magical powers forever) of their generation, while the others lose their powers and become mortals. Because of this, Jerry tries to teach his children to not become dependent on magic. Since one of them gets to keep their powers, though, Jerry also gives his children wizard lessons (the lessons end mid Season four). The storage room of the Russo family's sub station is a wizard's lair. In the lair is a Portal which allows them to visit the wizard world, and other creatures to visit them. The headmaster of the wizard council, Professor Crumbs (Ian Abercrombie), regularly pays visits to the Russo home.The Russo siblings attend Tribeca Prep and constantly encounter their Old West style principal, Mr. Laritate (Bill Chott). Because they live in the mortal world, the Russos are required to keep the existence of wizardry a secret. Even so, Alex's best friend, Harper Finkle (Jennifer Stone), discovers the secret in Season 2's episode "Harper Knows". Justin's best friend, Zeke Beakerman (Dan Benson), also finds out in Season 4's episode "Zeke Finds Out", also along with Alex's boyfriend, Mason Greyback (Gregg Sulkin).This series was created and as produced by Todd J. Greenwald, who began developing the show after working as a writer and consulting producer during the first season of Hannah Montana. The show is produced by It's a Laugh Productions and Disney Channel Original Productions. The theme song, "Everything Is Not What It Seems", written by John Adair and Steve Hampton, is of techno-pop style and is performed by Selena Gomez. The series is filmed at Hollywood Center Studios in Hollywood, California.[5]For the first three seasons the show used the same title sequence, the opening title sequence, which is set to Selena Gomez's rendition of "Everything Is Not What It Seems", shows Alex, Justin, Max and Harper engaging in magical antics while preparing for school in the morning. The fourth season began using a slightly altered version of the song, and a different sequence involving the cast, who all appear in Times Square at the end of the sequence with Alex waving her wand.The show debuted on Disney Channel on October 12, 2007 after the premiere of Twitches Too, gathering 5.9 million viewers.[6] In January 2010, "Wizards vs. Werewolves" one-hour special episode became the series' most-watched (non-crossover) episode with 6.2 million viewers,[7] surpassing the 6 million viewers of "Paint By Committee" episode[8] The series' most watched episode, including crossovers, was "Cast-Away (To Another Show)" episode, which was included in the special trilogy of crossover episodes between three Disney Channel original sitcoms, Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana. The broadcast was watched by 10.6 million viewers. In 2009, the series was the top scripted telecast for teens between the age of 914 (1.63 million/6.7 rating) and second in kids 611 (1.81 million/7.4 rating), which was only slightly behind The Suite Life on Deck (1.82 million/7.4 rating.)[9]The Disney Channel Original Movie, based on the series, premiered on August 28, 2009 on Disney Channel. Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie was filmed in Puerto Rico, Los Angeles, and New York City from February 16 to March 27, 2009.[10] The movie received 11.4 million viewers on its premiere,[11] making it the second-most-viewed DCOM premiere in the US after High School Musical 2. It was the 7th most watched basic cable telecast in 2009.[12] It won a Primetime Emmy Award in 2010 for "Outstanding Children's Program".On Friday, January 6, 2012, Wizards of Waverly Place aired its one-hour series finale, "Who Will Be The Family Wizard?", which averaged nearly 10 million viewers (9.8 million; live+same day)[13] to up to 11.3 million.[14] Although it was not the series' most-watched special, being behind, Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie, and Cast Away (To Another Show), it was the most-watched finale for a Disney Channel Original Series.[15]Excluding the crossover programming special, it was the franchise's most-watched episode.[15] The closer also set series best among kids 611 (4.2 million) and teens 914 (3.8 million). It also obtained a solid 1.9 rating with adults 1849.[16] Notably, the finale is the current TV season's most-watched cable telecast among scripted programs.[15]The show ended with Alex becoming the family wizard, Justin being declared new Headmaster of WizTech (also getting wizard powers), and Max getting to run the sub shop. Max is very happy with his position.On September 27, 2012, Disney Channel announced that Wizards of Waverly Place would return for an hour-long special, that began production on October 22, 2012, and ended production on November 10, 2012, for a premiere telecast on the cable channel in early 2013. The special, to be executive produced by Gomez, alongside series executive producers Vince Cheung and Ben Montanio (who will also co-write the special with Dan Berendsen), will center on the Russos' and Mason's visit to Tuscany to meet long-lost relatives from Jerry's side of the family. In an attempt to prove to her family that she's not merely a carefree wizard, Alex inadvertently casts a spell that creates two versions of her with differing personalities: an evil version of Alex that ends up involved in another wizard's plan for world domination, and a good version who upon discovering the wizard's plan, tries to find a way to save her family and mankind, leading to a literal battle between good and evil atop the Leaning Tower of Pisa.[1][2] The name of this will be "The Wizards Return: Alex vs. Alex".[17]The soundtrack album for the hit Disney Channel Original Series of the same name. The album was released as a physical CD, enhanced CD and digital on August 4, 2009, under Walt Disney Records.[18][19][20][21] The album includes songs from and inspired by the TV series and Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie.[21][22]In response to the soundtrack, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic recognized Wizards for its "teen revamps of boomer classics that parents can enjoy too". He also stated that the album is "agreeable" and that Selena Gomez "inevitably stands out from the pack". However, Erlewine said: "the dang-awful version of America's "You Can Do Magic" by Drew Seeley is sunk by its hyper-claustrophobic rhythms, the biggest rearrangement of a tune here and easily the worst cut."[20]A video game based on the series was released in August 2009.[23]The show's complete first season was released on September 10, 2009 in Germany,[34] on October 1, 2009 in Spain,[35] on March 3, 2010 in France and on March 12, 2010 in Poland.[36](Chinese)Wizards of Waverly Place at TV.com1 Premise2 Production

The series centers on the Griffins, a dysfunctional family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, The Life of Larry and Larry & Steve. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox on May 15, 1998. The show was given the green light and started production. Shortly after the third season of Family Guy aired in 2001, Fox canceled the series and went to a hiatus. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004.Family Guy has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since The Flintstones in 1961. Family Guy has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons for its similarities to The Simpsons.Many tie-in media have been released, including Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; Family Guy: Live in Vegas, a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the Family Guy universe; and Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy (2010), a series of parodies of the original Star Wars trilogy. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation. A spin-off series, The Cleveland Show, premiered on September 27, 2009, as a part of the "Animation Domination" lineup on Fox. The eighth season of Family Guy premiered the same night. Family Guy holds a TV-PG and TV-14 rating, with the latter being used more often.MacFarlane initially conceived Family Guy in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).[2] During college, he created his thesis film entitled The Life of Larry,[2] which was submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna-Barbera. MacFarlane was hired by the company.[3] In 1996 MacFarlane created a sequel to The Life of Larry entitled Larry and Steve, which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons.[2]Executives at Fox saw the Larry shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series, entitled Family Guy, based on the characters.[4] Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, and gave him a budget of $50,000.[5] Several aspects of Family Guy were inspired by the Larry shorts.[6] While working on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian.[4][7] MacFarlane stated that the difference between The Life of Larry and Family Guy was that "Life of Larry was shown primarily in my dorm room and Family Guy was shown after the Super Bowl."[6] After the pilot aired, the series was given the green light. MacFarlane drew inspiration from several sitcoms such as The Simpsons and All in the Family.[8] Premises were drawn from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he watched as a child, such as The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang and Rubik, the Amazing Cube.[9]The Griffin family first appeared on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998.[10] Family Guy was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show MADtv, but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought that that was the place to create a prime-time animation show.[8] Family Guy was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as King of the Hill, but the show was not bought until years later, when King of the Hill became successful.[8] Fox ordered 13 episodes of Family Guy to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.[11]MacFarlane has served as an executive producer during the show's entire history, and also functions as a creative consultant. The first executive producers were David Zuckerman,[12] Lolee Aries, David Pritchard, and Mike Wolf.[13] Family Guy has had many executive producers in its history, including Daniel Palladino, Kara Vallow, and Danny Smith. David A. Goodman joined the show as a co-executive producer in season three, and eventually became an executive producer.[14] Alex Borstein, who voices Lois, worked as an executive and supervising producer for the fourth and fifth seasons.[15] A more involved position on the show is the show runner, who acts as head writer and manages the show's production for an entire season.[16]The first team of writers assembled for the show consisted of Chris Sheridan,[17] Danny Smith, Gary Janetti, Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman, Garrett Donovan, Matt Weitzman, and Mike Barker.[18] The writing process of Family Guy generally starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts; when a script is finished it is given to the rest of the writers to read. These scripts generally include cutaway gags. If there are not enough cutaway sequences, writers are asked to create them. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason.[19] The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.[8]MacFarlane explains that he is a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology "Suspense", which led him to give early episodes ominous titles like "Death Has a Shadow" and "Mind Over Murder". MacFarlane explained that the team dropped the naming convention after individual episodes became hard to identify, and the novelty wore off.[20] For the first few months of production, the writers shared one office, lent to them by the King of the Hill production crew.[20]Credited with 14 episodes, Steve Callaghan is the most prolific writer on Family Guy staff. Many of the writers that have left the show have gone on to create or produce other successful series. Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan co-wrote 13 episodes for the NBC sitcom Scrubs during their eight-year run on the show, while also serving as co-producers and working their way up to executive producers.[21] Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman would later create American Dad, along with MacFarlane.[22][23]During the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike, official production of the show halted for most of December 2007 and for various periods afterward. Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane's final approval, which he termed "a colossal dick move" in an interview with Variety. Though MacFarlane refused to work on the show, his contract under Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it would subsequently produce.[24] Production officially resumed after the end of the strike, with regularly airing episodes recommencing on February17, 2008.[25]Family Guy officially premiered after Fox's broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIII on January 31, 1999, with "Death Has a Shadow". The show debuted to 22 million viewers, and immediately generated controversy regarding its adult content.[26] The show returned on April 11, 1999, with "I Never Met the Dead Man". Family Guy garnered decent ratings in Fox's 8:30pm slot on Sunday, scheduled between The Simpsons and The X-Files.[11] At the end of its first season, the show was No. 33 in the Nielsen ratings, with 12.8 million households tuning in.[27] The show launched its second season in a new time slot, Thursday at 9pm, on September 23, 1999. Family Guy was pitted against NBC's Frasier, and the series' ratings declined sharply.[11] Fox removed Family Guy from the network's permanent schedule, and began airing episodes irregularly. The show returned on March 7, 2000, at 8:30pm on Tuesdays, but was constantly beaten in the ratings by the new breakout hit Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, coming in at No. 114 in the Nielsen Ratings with 6.320 million households tuning in.[28] Fox announced that the show had been canceled in 2000, at the end of the second season.[29] However, following a last-minute reprieve, Fox announced on July 24, 2000, its intention to order 13 additional episodes of Family Guy to form a third season.[26]The show returned November 8, 2001, once again in a tough time slot: Thursday nights at 8:00pm ET. This slot brought it into competition with Survivor and Friends. (This situation was later referenced in Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story).[30] During its second- and third-season runs, Fox frequently moved the show around to different days and time slots with little or no notice and, consequently, the show's ratings suffered.[31] Upon Fox's annual unveiling of its 2002 fall line-up on May 15, 2002, Family Guy was absent.[11] Fox announced that the show had been officially canceled shortly thereafter.[32]Fox attempted to sell the rights for reruns of the show, but it was difficult to find networks that were interested; Cartoon Network eventually bought the rights, "[...] basically for free", according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television.[33] Family Guy premiered in reruns on Adult Swim on April 20, 2003, and immediately became the block's top-rated program, dominating late-night viewing in its time period versus cable and broadcast competition, and boosting viewership by 239%.[11][34] The complete first and second seasons were released on DVD the same week the show premiered on Adult Swim, and the show became a cult phenomenon, selling 400,000 copies within one month.[11] Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies,[35] becoming the best-selling television DVD of 2003[36] and the second-highest-selling television DVD ever, behind the first season of Comedy Central's Chappelle's Show.[37] The third-season DVD release also sold more than a million copies.[34] The show's popularity in DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox's interest,[38] and, on May 20, 2004, Fox ordered 35 new episodes of Family Guy, marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales.[37][39]"North by North Quahog", which premiered May 1, 2005, was the first episode to be broadcast after the show's cancellation. It was written by MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin.[40] MacFarlane believed the show's three-year hiatus was beneficial because animated shows do not normally have hiatuses, and towards the end of their seasons, "...you see a lot more sex jokes and [bodily function] jokes and signs of a fatigued staff that their brains are just fried".[41] With "North by North Quahog", the writing staff tried to keep the show "[...]exactly as it was" before its cancellation, and "None of us had any desire to make it look any slicker".[41] The episode was watched by 11.85 million viewers,[42] the show's highest ratings since the airing of the first season episode "Brian: Portrait of a Dog".[43]In March2007 comedian Carol Burnett filed a $6-million lawsuit against 20th Century-Fox, claiming that her charwoman character had been portrayed on the show without her permission. She stated it was a trademark infringement, and that Fox violated her publicity rights.[44][45][46] On June4, 2007, United States District Judge Dean D. Pregerson rejected the lawsuit, stating that the parody was protected under the First Amendment, citing Hustler Magazine v. Falwell as a precedent.[47]On October3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing the show of infringing its copyright on the song "When You Wish Upon a Star", through a parody song entitled "I Need a Jew" appearing in the episode "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein". Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a "thinly veiled" copy of its music with antisemitic lyrics. Named in the suit were 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Co., Cartoon Network, MacFarlane and Murphy; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages.[48] Bourne argued that "I Need a Jew" uses the copyrighted melody of "When You Wish Upon a Star" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.[49][50] On March16, 2009, United States District Judge Deborah Batts held that Family Guy did not infringe on Bourne's copyright when it transformed the song for comical use in an episode.[51]In December2007, Family Guy was again accused of copyright infringement when actor Art Metrano filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature "magic" act involving absurd "faux" magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune "Fine and Dandy".[52] 20th Century-Fox, MacFarlane, Callaghan and Borstein were all named in the suit.[53] In July 2009 a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair-use factors involved--"purpose and character of the use", "nature of the infringed work", and "amount and substantiality of the taking"--counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth--"economic impact"--had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers--not Metrano or his act.[54][55] The case was settled out of court in 2010 with undisclosed terms. [56]Seth MacFarlane voices three of the show's main characters: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, and Stewie Griffin.[57] Since MacFarlane had a strong vision for these characters, he chose to voice them himself, believing it would be easier than for someone else to attempt it.[9] MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design.[58] Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison,[59] especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady.[60] MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian.[9] MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time-only characters, most prominently those of the Griffins' neighbor Glenn Quagmire, news anchor Tom Tucker, and Lois' father, Carter Pewterschmidt.[61]Alex Borstein voices Peter's wife Lois Griffin, Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown, and Lois' mother, Barbara Pewterschmidt.[62] Borstein was asked to provide a voice for the pilot while she was working on MADtv. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork, and said it was "really sight unseen".[63] At the time, Borstein was performing in a stage show in Los Angeles. She played a redheaded mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins.[62][63]Seth Green primarily voices Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman.[61][64] Green stated that he did an impression of the character Buffalo Bill from the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs during his audition.[65][66]Mila Kunis and Lacey Chabert have both voiced Meg Griffin.[61] Chabert left the series because of time conflicts with schoolwork and her role on Party of Five. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.[67]Mike Henry voices Cleveland Brown, Herbert, Bruce the Performance Artist, Consuela and the Greased-up Deaf Guy.[68] Henry met MacFarlane at the Rhode Island School of Design, and kept in touch with him after they graduated.[69] A few years later, MacFarlane contacted him about being part of the show; he agreed and came on as a writer and voice actor.[69] During the show's first four seasons, he was credited as a guest star, but beginning with season five's "Prick Up Your Ears", he has been credited as a main cast member.[69]Other recurring cast members include Adam West as the eponymous Mayor Adam West;[70] Jennifer Tilly as Bonnie Swanson;[71] John G. Brennan as Mort Goldman and Horace the bartender; Carlos Alazraqui as Jonathan Weed;[72][73] Adam Carolla and Norm Macdonald as Death;[74] Lori Alan as Diane Simmons;[75] and Phil LaMarr as Ollie Williams and the judge.[76] Fellow cartoonist Butch Hartman has made guest voice appearances in many episodes as various characters.[77] Also, writer Danny Smith voices various recurring characters, such as Ernie the Giant Chicken.[78]Episodes often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians, and scientists. Many guest voices star as themselves. Leslie Uggams was the first to appear as herself, in the fourth episode of the first season, "Mind Over Murder".[79] The episode "Not All Dogs Go to Heaven" guest starred the entire cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation, including Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Gates McFadden, Michael Dorn, Wil Wheaton, Marina Sirtis, and even Denise Crosby (season 1 as Tasha Yar), playing themselves; this is the episode with the most guest stars of the seventh season.[80][81]The show revolves around the adventures of the family of Peter Griffin, a bumbling blue-collar worker. Peter is an Irish-American Catholic with a prominent Rhode Island and Eastern Massachusetts accent.[82] He is married to Lois, a stay-at-home mother and piano teacher who, as member of the Pewterschmidt family of wealthy socialites, has a distinct New England accent.[83] Peter and Lois have three children: Meg, their teenage daughter, who is awkward and does not fit in at school, and is constantly ridiculed and ignored by the family; Chris, their teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent and a younger version of his father in many respects; and Stewie, their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who has adult mannerisms and uses stereotypical archvillain phrases. Living with the family is Brian, the family dog, who is highly anthropomorphized, drinks martinis, and engages in human conversation, though he is still considered a pet in many respects.[84]Many recurring characters appear alongside the Griffin family. These include the family's neighbors: sex-crazed airline-pilot bachelor Glenn Quagmire, Cleveland Brown and his wife Loretta Brown, paraplegic police officer Joe Swanson, his wife Bonnie and their baby daughter Susie (Bonnie is pregnant with Susie from the show's beginning until the seventh episode of the seventh season); neurotic Jewish pharmacist Mort Goldman, his wife Muriel, and their geeky and annoying son Neil; and elderly ephebophile Herbert. TV news anchors Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, and Blaccu-Weather meteorologist Ollie Williams also make frequent appearances. Actors Adam West and James Woods guest star as themselves in various episodes.The primary setting of Family Guy is Quahog (/koh/), a fictional Rhode Island town. MacFarlane resided in Providence during his time as a student at Rhode Island School of Design, and the show contains distinct Rhode Island landmarks similar to real-world locations.[85][86] MacFarlane often borrows the names of Rhode Island locations and icons such as Pawtucket and Buddy Cianci for use in the show. MacFarlane, in an interview with local WNAC Fox 64 News, stated that the town is modeled after Cranston, Rhode Island.[87]The "Road to" episodes are a series of hallmark travel episodes.[88][89][90] They are a parody of the seven Road to... comedy films starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour, which were released between 1940 and 1962.[89] These episodes usually involve Stewie and Brian in some foreign, supernatural, or science fiction location not related to the show's normal location in Quahog. The first, entitled "Road to Rhode Island", aired on May 30, 2000, during the second season. The episodes are known for featuring elaborate musical numbers, similar to the Road films.[91] The episodes contain several trademarks, including a special version of the opening sequence, custom musical cues and musical numbers, and parodies of science fiction and fantasy films.[92]The original idea for the "Road to" episodes came from MacFarlane, as he is a fan of the films of Crosby, Hope, and Lamour. The first episode was directed by Dan Povenmire, who would direct the rest of the "Road to" episodes until the episode "Road to Rupert", at which point he had left the show to create Phineas and Ferb.[93][94] Series regular Greg Colton then took over Povenmire's role as director of the "Road to" episodes.[95]Family Guy uses the filmmaking technique of cutaways, which occur in the majority of Family Guy episodes.[96] Emphasis is often placed on gags which make reference to current events and/or modern cultural icons.Early episodes based much of their comedy on Stewie's "super villain" antics, such as his constant plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions to get rid of things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at matricide. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality.[97] Family Guy often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters break the fourth wall by addressing the audience. For example, in "North by North Quahog", the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been cancelled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared, Action, That '80s Show, Wonderfalls, Fastlane, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Skin, Girls Club, Cracking Up, The Pitts, Firefly, Get Real, Freakylinks, Wanda at Large, Costello, The Lone Gunmen, A Minute with Stan Hooper, Normal, Ohio, Pasadena, Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie, The $treet, The American Embassy, Cedric the Entertainer Presents, The Tick, Luis, and Greg the Bunny. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during Family Guy's hiatus.[98][99][100]The show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary characters have them. Notable expressions include Quagmire's "Giggity giggity goo", Peter's "Freakin' sweet", and Joe's "Bring it on!"[97] The use of many of these catchphrases declined in later seasons. The episode "Big Man on Hippocampus" mocks catchphrase-based humor: when Peter, who has forgotten everything about his life, is introduced to Meg, he exclaims "D'oh!", to which Lois replies, "No, Peter, that's not your catchphrase."[101]Family Guy has received many positive reviews from critics. Catherine Seipp of the National Review Online described it as a "nasty but extremely funny" cartoon.[102] Caryn James of The New York Times called it a show with an "outrageously satirical family" that "includes plenty of comic possibilities and parodies."[103] The Sydney Morning Herald named Family Guy the "Show of the Week" on April 21, 2009, hailing it a "pop culture-heavy masterpiece".[104] Frazier Moore from The Seattle Times called it an "endless craving for humor about bodily emissions". He thought it was "breathtakingly smart" and said a "blend of the ingenious with the raw helps account for its much broader appeal". He summarized it as "rude, crude and deliciously wrong".[105] The series has attracted many celebrities, including Emily Blunt, who has stated that Family Guy is her favorite series; she has expressed strong interest in becoming a guest star on the show.[106] The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin said that Family Guy is becoming one of the best animated shows; she commented on its ribaldry and popularity, and said the show was of better quality than The Simpsons.[107] The show has become a hit on Hulu; it is the second-highest viewed show after Saturday Night Live.[108] IGN called Family Guy a great show, and commented that it has gotten better since its revival. They stated that they cannot imagine another half-hour sitcom that provides as many laughs as Family Guy.[109] Empire praised the show and its writers for creating really hilarious moments with unlikely material. They commented that one of the reasons they love the show is because nothing is sacredit makes jokes and gags of almost everything.[110] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic praised the series as "a different kind of animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do."[111] Family Guy has proven popular in the United Kingdom, regularly obtaining between 700,000 and 1 million viewers for re-runs on BBC Three.[112]Many celebrities have admitted that they are fans of the show. Robert Downey, Jr. telephoned the show production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode creation, as his son is a fan of the show, so the producers came up with a character for Downey.[113] Lauren Conrad met MacFarlane while recording a Laguna Beach clip for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears", (season 5, 2006).[114][115] She has watched Family Guy for years and considers Stewie her favorite character.[114] Commenting on his appearance in the episode "Big Man on Hippocampus", (season 8, 2010), actor Dwayne Johnson stated that he was a "big fan" of Family Guy.[116] Johnson befriended MacFarlane after he had a minor role in Johnson's 2010 film Tooth Fairy.[116] R&B singer Rihanna has admitted to being a fan of Family Guy,[117] as has pop singer Britney Spears; she tries to imitate Stewie's English accent.[118] Spears, who was mocked for her personal problems in the South Park episode "Britney's New Look" in 2008, offered to appear in a cameo to hit back at the similar animated show, but MacFarlane declined, stating that he did not want to start a feud with the series.[119]Family Guy and its cast have been nominated for thirteen Emmy Awards, with four wins. MacFarlane won the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance award for his performance as Stewie;[120] Murphy and MacFarlane won the Outstanding Music and Lyrics award for the song "You Got a Lot to See" from the episode "Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows";[120] Steven Fonti won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode "No Chris Left Behind";[121] and Greg Colton won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode "Road to the Multiverse".[122] The show was nominated for eleven Annie Awards, and won three times, twice in 2006 and once in 2008.[123][124][125] In 2009 it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in this category since The Flintstones in 1961.[126] The Simpsons was almost nominated in 1993, but voters were hesitant to pit cartoons against live action programs.[127][128] The show was nominated for a Grammy in 2011.[129] Family Guy has been nominated and has won various other awards, including the Teen Choice Awards and the People's Choice Awards.[130][131][132] In the 1,000th issue of Entertainment Weekly, Brian Griffin was selected as the dog for "The Perfect TV Family".[133] Wizard Magazine rated Stewie the 95th-greatest villain of all time.[134] British newspaper The Times rated Family Guy as the 45th-best American show in 2009.[135] IGN ranked Family Guy at number seven in the "Top 100 Animated Series" and number six in the "Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time".[109][136] Empire named it the twelfth-greatest TV show of all time.[110] In 2005 viewers of the UK television channel Channel 4 voted Family Guy at number 5 on their list of the 100 Greatest Cartoons.[137] Brian was awarded the 2009 Stoner of the Year award by High Times for the episode "420", marking the first time an animated character received the honor.[138] In 2007 TV Guide ranked Family Guy number 15 in their list of top cult shows ever.[139] Family Guy has garnered six Golden Reel Awards nominations, winning three times.[140]Family Guy has received a negative treatment from some critics. One of the initial critics to give the show negative reviews was Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly; he called it "The Simpsons as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows".[141][142] The Parents Television Council (PTC), a conservative, non-profit watchdog, has attacked the series since its premiere and has branded various episodes as "Worst TV Show of the Week".[143][144][145] In May 2000 the PTC launched a letter-writing campaign to the Fox network in an effort to persuade the network to cancel the show.[146] The PTC has placed the show on their annual lists of "Worst Prime-Time Shows for Family Viewing" in 2000, 2005, and 2006.[147][148][149] The Federal Communications Commission has received multiple petitions requesting that the show be blocked from broadcasting on indecency grounds.[150] Tucker and the PTC have both accused the show portraying religion negatively, and of being racist.[151][152] Because of the PTC, some advertisers have canceled their contracts after reviewing the content of the episodes, claiming it to be unsuitable.[153][154] Critics have compared the show's humor and characters with those of The Simpsons.[155][156]Various episodes of the show have generated controversy. In "The Son Also Draws" (season one, 1999) Peter jokes that "Canada sucks"; this caused controversy with Canadian viewers.[157] In "420" (season seven, 2009) Brian decides to start a campaign to legalize cannabis in Quahog; the Venezuelan government reacted negatively to the episode and banned Family Guy from airing on their local networks, which generally syndicate American programming. Venezuelan justice minister Tareck El Aissami, citing the promotion of the use of cannabis, stated that any cable stations that did not stop airing the series would be fined;[158] the government showed a clip which featured Brian and Stewie singing the praises of marijuana as a demonstration of how the United States supports cannabis use.[159] In "Extra Large Medium" (season eight, 2010) a character named Ellen (who has Down syndrome) states that her mother is the former Governor of Alaska, which strongly implies that her mother is Sarah Palin, the only woman to have served in the office of governor in the state. Sarah Palin, the mother of a special-needs child, criticized the episode in an appearance on The O'Reilly Factor, calling those who made the show "cruel, cold-hearted people."[160]A comic book based on the Family Guy universe is being produced. Published by Titan Comics, it will be edited by Steve White and illustrated by Anthony Williams and S. L. Gallant. The writing and the illustrations will be supervised by the show's producers.[183] The comics will consist of a main story, a short story, and a gag strip. The first comic book was released on July 27, 2011.[183]As promotion for the show, and, as Newman described, "[to] expand interest in the show beyond its diehard fans",[184] Fox organized four Family Guy Live! performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud. The cast also performed musical numbers from the Family Guy: Live in Vegas comedy album.[184] The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 Montreal Comedy Festival.[184] The Family Guy Live! performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each.[185]In 2007, at the 59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, MacFarlane performed (as the digitally inserted Stewie and Brian) the ceremony's opening number. He performed a song insulting modern television to the tune of the song performed in the episode PTV. The song insulted TV shows such as Two and a Half Men, Desperate Housewives, and Scrubs, as well as the final scene of The Sopranos.In 2009 a special televised performance show aired entitled Family Guy Presents Seth & Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show, in which voice actors Alex Borstein and MacFarlane performed songs from the show, as well as a parody of Lady Gaga's song "Poker Face" in the voice of Marlee Matlin, who appeared on stage as a guest during the performance. Some new animated gags also appeared in the show.[186]On July 22, 2007, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, MacFarlane announced that he may start working on a feature film, although "nothing's official."[187] In TV Week on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released Family Guy feature film sometime "within the next year."[188] He came up with an idea for the story, "something that you could not do on the show, which [to him] is the only reason to do a movie." He later went to say he imagines the film to be "an old-style musical with dialogue" similar to The Sound of Music, saying that he would "really be trying to capture, musically, that feel."[189] On October 13, 2011, Seth MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a Family Guy film had been made, and that it would be written by himself and series co-producer Ricky Blitt.[190]On November 30, 2012, MacFarlane confirmed that Family Guy will get the movie treatment.[191]MacFarlane co-createdalongside Mike Henry and Richard Appelthe Family Guy spin-off The Cleveland Show, which premiered September 27, 2009. They began discussing the project in 2007.[192][193] Appel and Henry serve as the show's executive producers and showrunners, handling the day-to-day operations, with limited involvement from MacFarlane.[194] Henry and Appel conceived the show as "more of a family show, a sweeter show" than Family Guy.[195] The first season consists of 22 episodes,[196] and the show was picked up by Fox for a second season, which consists of 13 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009, before the first season began.[197] It was extended to a full second season.[198] Appel signed a new three-year, seven-figure deal with Fox to continue serving as showrunner on The Cleveland Show in 2010. Fox chairman Gary Newman commented: "What is special about him is his incredible leadership ability."[199] The show follows the Family Guy character Cleveland Brown, who is voiced by Henry, as he leaves the town of Quahog and moves with his son to start his own adventure.[192]The Family Guy Video Game! is a 2006 action game released by 2K Games and developed by High Voltage Software. The game received mixed reviews, averaging 50% favorable reviews for the PlayStation 2 version,[200] 51% for the PlayStation Portable version,[201] and 53% for the Xbox version,[202] according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game received praise for its humor,[203] but was criticized for its short playtime[204] and "uninteresting gameplay".[205] On November 2, 2009, IGN journalist Ryan Langley reported the production of a Family Guy-based party game for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii. He cited the LinkedIn profiles of former HB Studios developer Chris Kolmatycki and Invisible Entertainment co-owner Ron Doucet, which stated that the individuals had worked on the game.[206] MacFarlane recorded exclusive material of Peter's voice and other Family Guy characters for a 2007 pinball machine of the show by Stern Pinball.[207] A game called Family Guy Online was announced.[208]Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse, which is centred around the episode Road to the Multiverse, was released on 20th November 2012.As of 2009, six books have been released about the Family Guy universe, all published by HarperCollins since 2005.[209] The first, Family Guy: Stewie's Guide to World Domination (ISBN 978-0-06-077321-2) by Steve Callahan, was released in April26, 2005. Written in the style of a graphic novel, the plot follows Stewie's plans to rule the world.[210] Other books include Family Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One (ISBN 978-0-7528-7593-4), which covers the events of the episode "It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One";[211] and Family Guy and Philosophy: A Cure for the Petarded (ISBN 978-1-4051-6316-3), a collection of 17 essays exploring the connections between the series and historical philosophers.[212]Family Guy has been commercially successful in the home market.[213] The show was the first to be resurrected because of high DVD sales.[214][215] The first volume, covering the show's first two seasons, sold 1.67 million units, topping TV DVD sales in 2003, while the second volume sold another million units.[214][216] Volumes six and seven debuted at fifth place in United States DVD sales;[217][218] volume seven was the highest-selling television DVD, selling 171,000 units by June21, 2009.[218] Family Guy Presents Blue Harvest, the DVD featuring the Star Wars special "Blue Harvest", was released on January15, 2008, and premiered at the top of United States DVD sales.[219] The DVD was the first Family Guy DVD to include a digital copy for download to the iPod.[219] In 2004 the first series of Family Guy toy figurines was released by Mezco Toyz; each member of the Griffin family had their own toy, with the exception of Stewie, of whom two different figures were made.[220] Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures were released, with various forms of Peter.[221] In 2008 the character Peter appeared in advertisements for Subway Restaurants, promoting the restaurant's massive feast sandwich.[222][223] Quotations related to Family Guy at Wikiquote  Media related to Family Guy at Wikimedia CommonsFamily Guy at TV.comComedySurreal humorSeth MacFarlaneDavid ZuckermanSeth MacFarlaneAlex BorsteinSeth GreenMila KunisMike HenryWalter MurphyRon JonesSeth MacFarlaneDavid A.

The show is set in a fictional Wisconsin town called Genoa City, which is unlike and unrelated to the real life village of the same name, Genoa City, Wisconsin.[1] First broadcast on March 26, 1973, The Young and the Restless was originally broadcast as half-hour episodes, five times a week.[2][3] It expanded to one hour episodes on February 4, 1980.[4] In 2006, the series began airing encore episodes weeknights on SOAPnet.[5] The series is also syndicated internationally.[6]The Young and the Restless originally focused on two core families: the wealthy Brooks family and the working class Foster family.[2] After a series of recasts and departures, in the early 1980s all the original characters except Jill Foster Abbott were written out. Bell replaced them with the new core families, the Abbotts and the Williams.[2] Over the years, other families such as the Newmans, Winters and the Baldwin-Fishers were introduced.[7][8] Despite these changes, one storyline that has endured through almost the show's entire run is the feud between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor, the longest rivalries on any American soap opera.[9][10]Since its debut, The Young and the Restless has won seven Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series. It is also currently the highest-rated daytime drama on American television. As of 2008, it has appeared at the top of the weekly Nielsen ratings in that category for more than 1,000 weeks since 1988.[11] The series, along with NBC's Days of our Lives (both are from Sony Pictures Television), has been renewed through 2013 with optional 2014.To compete with the youthful staines ABC soap operas, All My Children, One Life to Live, and General Hospital, CBS executives wanted a new daytime serial that was youth oriented.[12] William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell created The Young and the Restless in 1972 for the network under the working title, The Innocent Years![12][13] "We were confronted with the very disturbing reality that young America had lost much of its innocence," Bell said. "Innocence as we had known and lived it all our lives had, in so many respects, ceased to exist."[14] They changed the title of the series to The Young and the Restless because they felt it "reflected the youth and mood of the early seventies."[14] The Bells named the fictional setting for the show after the real Genoa City, Wisconsin, which was located on their way from their then-home in Chicago to their annual summer vacation spot in Lake Geneva.[1]The Young and the Restless began airing on March 26, 1973, replacing the canceled soap opera, Where the Heart Is.[4] Bell worked as head writer from the debut of the series until his retirement in 1998.[15] He wrote from his home in Chicago while production took place in Los Angeles, California.[6] John Conboy acted as the show's first executive producer, staying in the position until 1982.[4] Bell and H. Wesley Kenney became co-executive producers that year until Edward Scott took over in 1989. Bell then became senior executive producer.[4] Other executive producers included David Shaughnessy,[16] John F. Smith,[17] Lynn Marie Latham,[18] Josh Griffith,[19] Maria Arena Bell, and Paul Rauch.[20]In the mid-1980s, Bell and his family moved to Los Angeles to create a new soap opera.[6] During this time, his three children, William Jr., Bradley, and Lauralee Bell, each became involved in soap operas. Lauralee Bell worked as an actress on The Young and the Restless. Bradley Bell co-created The Bold and the Beautiful with his father. William Bell Jr. became involved in the family's production companies as president of Bell Dramatic Serial Co. and Bell-Phillip Television Productions Inc.[6] "It's worked out very well for us because we really all worked in very different aspects of the show," William Bell Jr. said. "With my father and I, it was a great kind of partnership and pairing in the sense that he had a total control of the creative side of the show and I didn't have even the inclination to interject in what he was doing."[6]After William J. Bell's 1998 retirement, a number of different head writers took over the position, including Kay Alden, Trent Jones, John F. Smith, Lynn Marie Latham, Scott Hamner, Josh Griffith, Maria Arena Bell, and Hogan Sheffer.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22]In 2012, former General Hospital executive producer Jill Farren Phelps was hired as the new executive producer of the soap, replacing Bell. Griffith was also named the sole head writer.[23]Taped at CBS Television City, studios 41 and 43 in Hollywood since its debut on March 26, 1973,[24] the show was packaged by the distribution company Columbia Pictures Television.[3][25] The Young and the Restless originally aired as a half-hour series on CBS and was the first soap opera to focus on the visual aspects of production, creating "a look that broke with the visual conventions of the genre."[2][3] Similar to the radio serials that had preceded them, soap operas at the time primarily focused on dialogue, characters, and story, with details like sets as secondary concerns.[2] The Young and the Restless stood out by using unique lighting techniques and camera angles, similar to Hollywood-style productions.[25][26] The style of videotaping included using out-of-the-ordinary camera angles and a large number of facial close-ups with bright lighting on the actors' faces.[2][25][26][27] Conboy said he used lighting to create "artistic effects".[26] Those effects made the series look dark, shadowy, and moody.[2][26] The Young and the Restless' look influenced the taping styles of other soap operas.[2] When H. Wesley Kenney replaced Conboy as executive producer, he balanced the lighting of the scenes.[27]Due to the success of the series, CBS and their affiliates pressured Bell to lengthen the series from 30 minutes to a full hour. Bell attributed this change to the show's fall from number one in the Nielsen ratings, since the lengthening of the show led to the departure of a number of cast members.[2] "The issue of performing in a one-hour show had not been part of their contracts," Bell said.[2] This forced the show to recast multiple main characters and eventually phase out the original core families in favor of new ones.[2]On June 27, 2001, The Young and the Restless became the first daytime soap opera to be broadcast in high-definition.[28] In September 2011, The Young and the Restless sister soap The Bold and the Beautiful will become the second-to-last soap to make the transition from SD to HD. On April 24, 2006, SoapNet began airing same-day episodes of the series.[5]Co-creators William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell centered The Young and the Restless around two core families, the wealthy Brooks' and the poor Fosters.[2][12][14] Bell borrowed this technique of soap opera building from his mentor, Irna Phillips.[25]While casting for the series, Bell and executive producer John Conboy auditioned 540 actors for the 13 main characters.[29] They assembled the youngest group of actors ever cast on a soap opera at the time, hiring mostly unknown actors[30] who they considered "glamorous model types".[25] Chemistry between actors also factored into the criteria for casting.[26] The stories focused on the younger characters, with an emphasis in fantasy.[2][14] The fantasy element was reflected in the love story between Jill Foster and the millionaire Phillip Chancellor II; the Leslie Brooks, Brad Elliot, and Lorie Brooks love triangle; and Snapper Foster's romance with Chris Brooks.[2][26]Sexuality also played a major role in the stories.[2][25][27] Formerly, soap operas did not delve into the sexual side of their romances. Bell changed that, first during his time as head writer of Days of our Lives and again on The Young and the Restless.[25] William Gray Espy's Snapper Foster is considered the "first to discover sex on a soap opera."[27] During the story, the character is engaged to Chris Brooks (Trish Stewart) and having a sexual relationship with Sally McGuire (Lee Crawford).[27] Other plots reflected sexual themes as well. For the first time in the genre, the dialogue and the story situations included explicit sexual themes such as premarital intercourse, impotence, incest, and rape.[2] The series also explored social issues. Jennifer Brooks underwent the first mastectomy on a soap opera.[26] Other social issue storylines included bulimia, alcoholism, and cancer.[31] Lesbianism was also touched on with Katherine Chancellor, who flirts with Jill while drunk in 1974 and has a brief relationship with Joann Curtis (Kay Heberle) in 1977.[31]When the series lengthened from a half hour to an hour in 1980, multiple cast members who portrayed characters from the original core families departed because their contracts only bound them to performing in a half hour show.[2] A number of the characters were recast until one of the few remaining original actors, Jamie Lyn Bauer, who portrayed Lorie Brooks, decided to leave. When she announced her intention not to renew her contract, Bell decided to replace the original core families.[2] "As I studied the remaining cast, I realized I had two characters- Paul Williams, played by Doug Davidson, and Jack Abbott, played by Terry Lester- both of whom had a relatively insignificant presence on the show," Bell said. "They didn't have families. Hell, they didn't even have bedrooms. But these became the two characters I would build our two families around."[2]The characters from the Abbott and Williams families were integrated into the series while the Brooks and Foster families, with the exception of Jill, were phased out. The continuity of the feud between Jill and Katherine, which began in the early years of the show, smoothed the transition.[2] The relationship between the two characters remained a central theme throughout the series and became the longest lasting rivalry in daytime history.[9]Another character introduced in the 1980s was Eric Braeden's Victor Newman.[2][7] Originally, the character was "a despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser" who was intended to be killed off.[7] Braeden's tenure on the show was meant to last between eight and twelve weeks. "When I saw Eric Braeden's first performance- the voice, the power, the inner strength- I knew immediately that I didn't want to lose this man," Bell said. "He was exactly what the show needed. Not the hateful man we saw on-screen, but the man he could and would become."[7] Bell rewrote the story to save the character and put Braeden on contract. Victor's romance with Nikki Reed became a prominent plot in the series.[7]With the success of another enduring character, Kimberlin Brown's Sheila Carter, Bell made daytime drama history in 1992 by successfully crossing her over from The Young and the Restless, to his second soap The Bold and the Beautiful. The success of the crossover was due in part to the creativity of Bell, as the nefarious character of Sheila was presumed to have died in a fire on The Young and the Restless.In the 1990s, core black characters were introduced with the Barber and Winters families. Victoria Rowell (Drucilla Barber) and Tonya Lee Williams (Dr. Olivia Barber) were cast as the nieces of the Abbott's maid, Mamie Johnson, in 1990.[32] The brothers Neil (Kristoff St. John) and Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore) were introduced as love interests for Olivia and Drucilla.[8] The Young and the Restless became popular among black viewers, which Williams and St. John attributed to the writing for the black characters.[8][33][34] "I play a CEO at a major corporation, that's something we don't see that often," St. John said. "And the show doesn't use the old African-American stereotypes that we have been seeing on TV, like the hustler, the pimp, the drug dealer. We have come a long way."[33] Though the characters held prominent positions in the fictional work place of Genoa City, they had little interaction with other characters outside of their jobs.[35]Executive ProducersHead WritersThe serial has won 111 Daytime Emmys, along with 334 nominations. The following list summarizes awards won by The Young and the Restless:"Nadia's Theme" has been the theme song of The Young and the Restless since the show's debut in 1973.[4][6] The melody, originally titled "Cotton's Dream", was composed by Barry De Vorzon and Perry Botkin, Jr. for the 1971 theatrical film Bless the Beasts and Children. The melody was later renamed "Nadia's Theme" after the ABC television network's sports summary program Wide World of Sports lent the music for a montage of Romanian gymnast Nadia Comneci's routines during the 1976 Summer Olympics;[67] despite the title, Nadia never performed her floor exercises using this piece of music. Instead, she used a piano arrangement of a medley of the songs "Yes Sir, That's My Baby" and "Jump in the Line.Botkin wrote a rearranged version of the piece specifically for The Young and the Restless' debut.[6] The song remained unchanged, save for a three-year stint in the early 2000s (decade), when an alternate, more jazzy arrangement of that tune was used, using portions of the longer closing version of the original theme.[6]In late September and early October 2012, the opening credits changed after many years and celebrating the shows 3000th episode .As of 2010, The Young and the Restless has managed over 1,000 consecutive weeks in the #1 spot for daytime dramas.[68] On the week ending April 6, 2012, The Young and the Restless was watched by a new low of an average of 3,960,000 viewers for the week, beating its previous low of 4.209 million in October 2011, as well as being the only week to date below 4 million viewers.[69] Currently, the show is still the most-watched daytime drama; and for the season 201112, has a household rating of 3.5, and 1.5 for the Women 1849 demographic.[70] As of 2008, the Tuesday episode of The Young and the Restless on average is the most-watched daytime drama showing.[71]When introduced during the 197273 season, the show was at the bottom of the ratings, but rose rapidly: ninth by 197475 and third by 197576. By 19881989 it had dethroned long-time leader General Hospital as the top-rated soap, a position it has held ever since.The Bold and

The series premiered on The CW on September 2, 2008 with a two episode special.The series revolves around several students at the fictional West Beverly Hills High School, including new Beverly Hills residents Annie Wilson and Dixon Wilson. Their father, Harry Wilson, has returned from Kansas to his Beverly Hills childhood home with his family to care for his mother, former television and theater actress Tabitha Wilson, who has a drinking problem and clashes with his wife Debbie. Annie and Dixon struggle to adjust to their new lives while making friends and yet adhering to their parents' wishes. During its first two seasons, 90210 featured cast members from the original series, including Jennie Garth, Shannen Doherty, Tori Spelling, Ann Gillespie, and Joe E. Tata. However, after the conclusion of the second season, there are no plans for any original stars to return. DVR ratings for the series have sometimes doubled its broadcast ratings.[1][2]On May 3, 2012, The CW officially renewed 90210 for a fifth season.[3]It premiered on October 8, 2012.[4]The project was put on the fast track by the network[clarification needed], and an order of the pilot was expected by the end of the month. The Beverly Hills, 90210 creator, Darren Star, was announced not to be involved with the project. The only surviving element from the original series was believed to be Creative Artists Agency, the talent agency which conceived the spin-off idea. Veronica Mars creator Rob Thomas was in negotiations to write the pilot and Mark Piznarski was in talks to direct.A detailed breakdown of the pilot written by Thomas was released on March 17, containing information on the plot and characters which would be in the series. None of the characters were related to the original series except Erin Silver played be Jessica Stroup; however, the series' featured a similar premise: a family with two teenagers who recently moved from the Midwest to Beverly Hills. To reflect the situation at the Beverly Hills school, where around 40 percent of the students were of Persian descent, a student named Navid Shirazi was created. Thomas intended to introduce The Peach Pit, the diner from Beverly Hills, 90210, but noted that it would not be featured in the pilot. The writer considered giving the siblings a job at a movie theater, as he did not want them to use their parents' credit cards. Thomas revealed that there were plans to reintroduce one of the original cast members, but had not met with any of them to discuss a role. Thomas later elaborated the producers wanted to see "as many of the original cast members as possible", but were careful not to "parade them all out in the pilot".On April 14, Thomas announced that he was arriving the series to focus on his two pilots for ABC. Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah were hired as the new executive producers and wrote a new version of the script in late April. Sachs said that although Thomas had a "great script", their version of the script was edgier. Judah said that they were trying to ground their script in reality, with real character stories and emotional stories. The writers wanted the audience to relate to the characters' problems, which they wanted to be truthful and emotional, but also comedic. The pair were interested in telling several stories simultaneously, featuring many characters.[5] The pair changed the surname of the main family from Mills to Wilson, along with changing the name of the mother from Celia to Debbie. The pair also told reporters that they would be adding their "comedic impulses" to the script.[6] Sachs and Judah found the parents to be an important part of the series, and designed to be contemporary parents.[5] Since the producers were both fathers, they designed the script to include more prominent adult story lines and a strong point of view on parenting. Judah was interested in focusing on how the family kept their moral center when moving to Beverly Hills, and the way the parents dealt with their teenagers.[7] On May 11, one day before The CW's upfront presentations, the network officially picked up the series for the 20082009 television season.[8]The show was largely considered unsuccessful during its first season. After disagreeing with the network executives over the series' storylines, Sachs and Judah ended their tenure as producers. The CW wanted the series to have a female perspective and focus more on teenage life and glamour; however, Judah and Sachs were more comfortable writing for men, featuring family stories. The studio brought in Rebecca Rand Kirshner Sinclair, co-executive producer of the popular show Gilmore Girls, to revamp the failing 90210. Sinclair is largely credited for saving the show, which now has steady ratings in its third season. For the remainder of the first season, Judah worked in post-production, including editing and music supervision, while Sachs ran the production on set. Rebecca Sinclair began retooling the series as head writer and formally took over the show at the start of season 2.[9] In late February 2009, Sinclair signed a seven-figure deal with the producers to serve as executive producer/showrunner for the series' second and third seasons.[10]On February 16, 2010 The CW renewed the show for a third season.[11] It was also moved to Mondays at 8/7c.[12] On April 26, 2011, The CW renewed the show for a fourth season.[13] On March 17, 2011, it was revealed that Sinclair would step down as executive producer when her contract expires at the end of season 3.[14] It was later announced that former Life Unexpected executive producers Patti Carr and Lara Olsen had been hired to take over the series.[15] The show also returned to its debut timeslot, Tuesday's at 8:00 p.m.[16] On May 3, 2012, The CW officially renewed 90210 for a fifth season.[17]On March 13, 2008, Kristin Dos Santos of E! confirmed that the series would be a spin-off with new characters and not a remake.[18] In order for the project to be ready for the network's "upfront" presentations to advertisers in May, casting began before the script was completed.[19] The first actor to be cast was Dustin Milligan,[20] followed by AnnaLynne McCord.[21] The role of Annie Wilson was originally offered to Hilary Duff but she turned it down because she didn't agree with the plot[22] so it was given to Shenae Grimes, who says she was raised watching the original series.[6] Rob Estes was the last actor to join the series; he was sought by The CW to play the part of Harry Wilson. Estes was a previous cast member of the first Beverly Hills, 90210 spin-off, Melrose Place.[23]Following rumors of cast members from Beverly Hills, 90210 appearing on the spin-off, The CW confirmed that Shannen Doherty and Jennie Garth would be returning in recurring roles, along with Joe E. Tata, for a few episodes, as their original characters.[24] Sachs was familiar with Garth, and talked to her about a possible role in the series. Garth agreed to star on the series without reading a script after brainstorming ideas with Sachs.[5] The producers offered Garth a role as a series regular, but she opted to sign on as a recurring character.[25] Sachs met with Doherty over dinner, and told her about the 90210 spin-off. Over the next few weeks, they established Brenda's backstory and Doherty agreed to guest-star in several episodes.[5][24] Sachs described Tata's casting as an accident; a friend told Sachs that he had seen Tata in a store, which led to the offer of a role in the series. Sachs said that Tata was ecstatic about the idea and agreed. After reading the script, Tori Spelling expressed interest returning, and the writers decided to give Donna her own fashion line.[26] Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premiere, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season.[27] On August 11, it was reported that Spelling had pulled out of the series after discovering that she was receiving less pay than Garth and Doherty. Spelling asked for her salary of $20,000 per episode to be increased to match their salaries$40,000 to $50,000 per episodebut when denied she left the show altogether.[28] Jessica Lowndes portrays Adrianna Tate-Duncan, a theatre "goddess" who suffers a drug addiction,[29] and was later upgraded to a starring role in Jessica Walters' spot.[30]Sinclair announced in March 2009 that the series' second season would rely less on 90210 alums like Jennie Garth and Shannen Doherty to boost ratings. She felt that "the show tried to be a lot of things to a lot of people in its first season [...] I think the center lies with the generation of kids that are in high school now." It was also announced that Dustin Milligan would not be coming back for season two, while Matt Lanter would be joining the cast as a series regular.[31] Casting soon began for new characters to be introduced in the second season. In June 2009, the series was reportedly looking for an actor to play the recurring role of Teddy, a tennis champ returning to West Beverly.[32] Actor and model Trevor Donovan was later cast in the role.[33] Ann Gillespie returned in the second season for multiple episodes as Jackie Taylor, Silver and Kelly's mother. Her character was once again sober and hoped to reconnect with her daughters after being diagnosed with cancer.[34]Much like the original show, 90210 follows the move of a family (parents Debbie and Harry Wilson, their daughter Annie and adopted son Dixon). Harry is actually from Beverly Hills and comes back both to look after his mother Tabitha and to work as the principal at West Beverly Hills High School. All of them struggle to adjust to their new lives: Annie has a hard time balancing romances (starting with rich kid Ty) and friendships as well as popularity and identity; Dixon has issues with his adoption; Harry and Debbie struggle with the revelation that Harry has a son with Tracy, his former high school sweetheart.Tracy Clark has a daughter of her own, Naomi Clark, who dates jock Ethan Ward, brief rival of Dixon, whom she soon breaks up with. Annie and Ethan then pursue a relationship after having had a fling years prior to Annie moving to Beverly Hills. Both girls alternate between being friends, enemies, in a love triangle, and almost sisters due to their parents' child. Their respective mothers find themselves in a love triangle of their own after Tracy's marriage to Charles Clark implodes (which Naomi takes quite badly) and she appears to want Harry back. Naomi's fight with Annie forces her out of the crowd after she uses Annie's ex-boyfriend from Kansas, Jason, as a weapon to get back at her for hiding her relationship with Ethan. She becomes friends with a group of older girls and starts flirting with Ozzie, a rather alternative student, and later becomes attracted to a bartender named Liam, whom she soon finds out is actually her age and becomes a student at West Beverly High. Meanwhile, Ethan and Annie's relationship hits the rocks as he begins to rethink his life after a car accident and gets more or less attracted to Rhonda, the girl he hit. Soon Naomi and Liam begin a romance, and once she becomes friends with Annie again, he begins to pursue the both of them.Naomi's best friend, fallen starlet Adrianna Tate-Duncan, battles a drug addiction. This gets her into trouble when Harry decides to raid the school, thanks to the help of a cop, Kimberly McIntyre, under cover as a student. Kimberly begins a relationship with teacher/lacrosse coach Ryan Matthews, which gets him into trouble with the school. Guilt-ridden, Kimberly does her best to solve the case, giving Ryan his job back, although he takes a leave of absence to rethink his life, and Adrianna lands in rehab, after almost getting Naomi in legal troubles as she took the blame for the drugs. There, she begins a relationship with Navid Shirazi, head of the school's paper and Dixon's best friend, who paid for her rehab. Although at first she only does it to "repay" him, they start to genuinely care about each other. Adrianna later discovers she is pregnant as a result of her promiscuity while she was addicted. After telling Navid of her pregnancy, he breaks up with her. It is later revealed that the father of Adrianna's child is Ty, although it is unclear when they slept together. She and Navid get back together when he realizes that even though she is a mess he can't get over her, and get engaged, although he alienates his family when he tells them that the child is not his and gets upset when Adrianna reveals her daughter is Ty's.Another featured character is Erin Silver (who goes by her last name), Kelly Taylor and David Silver's half sister and Naomi's former best friend, until Silver's father's affair is revealed by Naomi, although she eventually reconciles her friendship with Naomi. She quickly befriends Annie and starts dating Dixon, who is somewhat taken aback by her not-so-90210 lifestyle, as she is a virgin who doesn't care about popularity. In a multi-episode arc that culminated in a very special episode, it is revealed that Silver has bipolar disorder. Kelly Taylor is now a guidance counselor at West Beverly and has a son named Sammy. Kelly becomes Silver's guardian after her mother proves to be an inadequate caretaker for her daughter due to her alcoholism. She briefly dates Ryan before leaving to work on her relationship wit student/cop Kimberly but also that he slept with Brenda, re-creating the rift between the two friends. Following Brenda's discovery that she cannot have children, however, the women are drawn together in an accord once again.At the prom, Adrianna goes into labor. She gives birth to a daughter whom she gives up for adoption. It is also revealed that Brenda has adopted a child from China. Ethan begins to realize his feelings for Silver, which leads to a confrontation with Dixon and a kiss with Silver. At Naomi and Jen's (her sister) after-prom party, Liam sleeps with Jen. He is mad that Naomi told Jen about his past: he wanted to keep it a secret. However, he was not aware that Jen was Naomi's sister, and upon finding out is horrified.

This culminates in a major fight between Annie and Naomi where Annie is shunned by her peers, runs away, gets in her car drunk, and accidentally runs over a man.Season two begins with the end of summer school. Naomi unknowingly dates a married man in an attempt to get over Liam, who shows up at West Beverly on the first day of school after being absent for the entire summer.

Their relationship is put under further pressure with the arrival of Teddy Montgomery, Adrianna's ex-boyfriend (to whom Adrianna lost her virginity). Meanwhile, the emotionally distant and guilt-ridden Annie has cut herself from society as much as possible, contributing to a growing discord between her and her brother, who is angry at her for sending him to summer school.

They form a friendship, which is later made complicated by Ivy having feelings for Liam, feelings which Liam rebuffs. Navid and Gia launch an investigation, believing that Jasper is a drug dealer. Being upset about her break-up with Navid, Adrianna relapses on drugs. Sasha tells Dixon she is pregnant, at which Debbie and Harry think she is lying. Debbie meets Sasha and she finds out that Sasha is not really pregnant, and advises her to stay away from her son.

After Dixon realizes that Jen is the one who slept with Liam and not Annie, he opts to help Annie. Naomi also feels bad for Annie when she learns the truth about prom night.

McCord was cast because, according to Sachs, "she's someone who is worldly, and there's a sophistication to her that's interesting".[37] The role of Annie was given to Shenae Grimes, who says she was raised watching the original series.[6] Sachs and Judah had seen Grimes' work before and knew "she had the acting chops", and she was cast after acting a dramatic scene which she "just killed". Sachs stated, "she can act, she's beautiful, and she can give this sweet cuteness [that lets us see] through her eyes into this world."[37]Lori Loughlin auditioned for the role of Debbie and was given the part straight away. Sachs thought that Loughlin was too established to read for the part, but realized that she understood the role immediately. The producers were fans of Jessica Walter after watching her film, Play Misty for Me. Sachs found that Walter knew pieces of scenes, and suggested "stuff that works".[37] Sachs described Ryan Eggold, who portrayed Matthews, as "a sophisticated actor, and he's also very funny". Sachs believed that every time Eggold would be on screen, "people are going to go, 'Wow!'".[37] The producers were looking for an actor who could portray Silver as a "quirky kid who moves to her own beat". Sachs explained that Jessica Stroup "came in dressed for the part, artsy and quirky, and she had her hair up and she had a bandanna. She nailed it."[37] The producers were fans of Tristan Wilds for his acting on The Wire, and hoped to hire him as Dixon from the start of casting. When asked about Michael Steger, who portrays Navid, Sachs said "he's just great".[37] Rob Estes, the last actor to join the series, was a previous cast member of the first Beverly Hills, 90210 spin-off, Melrose Place. Estes was sought by The CW to play Harry,[38] but was contracted on the drama Women's Murder Club. When that series was cancelled, Sachs called Estes and explained the spin-off to him, and he thought it was a great idea. Sachs promised that although he was playing a parent, he would not "be furniture... as in the seldom seen or heard parents who populate many youth-centric series, like the Walsh parents on the original 90210."[37]The CW confirmed that Jennie Garth, Shannen Doherty, Tori Spelling and Joe E. Tata would be returning in recurring roles as their original characters.[24] Sachs was familiar with Garth, and talked to her about a possible role in the series. Garth agreed to star on the series without reading a script after brainstorming ideas with Sachs.[39] The producers offered Garth a role as a series regular, but she opted to sign on as a recurring character.[25] Doherty decided to appear after talking with Sachs, but her appearance was moved to the second episode.[24] Sachs described Tata's casting as an accident; a friend told Sachs that he had seen Tata in a store, which led to the offer of a recurring role in the series. Sachs said that Tata was ecstatic about the idea and agreed.[40] After reading the script, Spelling expressed interest in returning, and the writers decided to give her character her own fashion line.[40] Spelling was scheduled to appear in the premire, but due to personal reasons and the birth of her daughter, she opted to appear later in the season.[41]Main cast90210 first airs in the United States on The CW, Tuesdays at 8:00 pm Eastern/7:00 pm Central.[16]In the UK, the series airs on E4, after beating off competition from Channel 5, ITV2 and Living for the rights to broadcast the show.[46][47] In Australia it aired on Network Ten for 6 episodes until the network pulled it from their schedules due to low ratings. However, on January 2011 it started airing on Eleven as part of a broadcast schedule aimed at a younger audience.[48] Due to poor performance, Eleven also pulled 90210 off their schedule. It's now shown on Sunday Afternoons at 5:00p.m.[49] The show airs in the Republic of Ireland on RTE Two, initially the show aired in a prime-time slot of Thursdays paired with Ugly Betty. When the show returned for its second season the show was moved to an early morning timeslot of just after midnight where it still airs.Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of 90210 on The CW.The series premiere was seen by 4.65million U.S. viewers.[68] The UK premiere was seen by 468,000 viewers on E4.[69]The second season premiered to 2.56 million viewers and achieved 1.3 rating in the Adults 18-49 demographic, up 18% from its first season finale but down 50% from its series premiere.[70] Although ratings decreased after its three-month hiatus it was the #1 most successful show on DVR in the 18-49 percentage increase between March 2228 increasing to a 1.1 rating.[71] DVR ratings for the show have sometimes doubled its broadcast ratings.[1][2] The CW have described it's DVR ratings as some of the most impressive on TV and cited them as the reason for the series' fourth season renewal.[72]The third season premiere was viewed by 1.96million viewers in the United States and achieved a 0.9 rating in Adults 18-49.[73] Episode 11 hit season highs in all categories with a 1.1 Adults 18-49 rating, 1.4 Adults 18-34 and 2.1 in The CW's target of Women 18-34. It was also the most watched episode in over a year with 2.18million viewers tuning in.[74] In the UK, the eighth episode of season three "Mother Dearest" was seen by 548,000 viewers, bettering its series premiere.[69]Most reviews of the pilot were average. Metacritic gave the episode a Metascorea weighted average based on the impressions of a select 12 critical reviewsof 46, signifying mixed or average reviews.[75] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that like the original, 90210 was "pretty good". Gilbert said that the episode "seemed to take forever to set up some remarkably bland plotlines", which he found had been executed with more finesse by other teen soaps. The reviewer criticized the writers for "unimaginative material", and commented on the risqu oral sex scene. Gilbert claimed that the characters lacked depth and distinction throughout the pilot, especially Naomi, whom he compared negatively to Gossip Girl's Blair Waldorf.[76] By contrast, Tom Gliatto of People magazine gave Naomi Clark a favorable review, but stated that he felt the cast as a whole had yet to gel.[77] When compared to the original series, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the spin-off covered the same themesfamily, friends, teen melodrama, relationshipsbut with more humor. Owen praised the compelling characters and the acting, and found the dialogue to be more painful than clever.[78]As the show continued its first season, the response became considerably more positive, and by the second season critical response was favorable. Entertainment Weekly gave the second season an A-, stating that "all it took was a little sunshine to give this show some heat", and that the "new, trashier take is working" after what they considered a "drippy" first season.[79] LaDale Anderson of Canyon News commented on the change between the first two seasons, saying that "the transformation of the characters and storylines in season two has been fantastic", and "sometimes a show needs a makeover and with the right pieces in place a not so good show can become something sensational." The reviewer opined that "what has worked so well [...] is that the characters are not one-dimensional. With most shows characters seamlessly continue to embody characteristics that solely define them, but not here." Anderson also praised the writing, saying it was "intricate and intertwines itself without forcing the storylines to connect; they mesh naturally."[80]90210 at TV.com1 Production

A male sibling is called a brother, and a female sibling is called a sister. In most societies throughout the world, siblings usually grow up together, facilitating the development of strong emotional bonds such as love, hostility or thoughtfulness. The emotional bond between siblings is often complicated and is influenced by factors such as parental treatment, birth order, personality, and personal experiences outside the family.[1]Sibling is a modern revival of the Old English word sibling, meaning "relative, kinsman", a derivative of sibb "kinship, relationship", from Proto-Germanic *sibj "race", from Proto-Indo-European *s(w)eb- "one's own people, tribe". The term, along with its shortened form sib, may have been in use dialectally throughout the Middle English and Early Modern English periods, but was officially recognized c. 1903 when it came into common use in anthropology as a translation of the German genetics term Geschwister ("a brother or sister"). The word is further related to dialectal term sibred ("relationship"); as well as to the second part of the word gossip, from Old English gdsibb, meaning "a sponsor, close relation".A "full sibling" (full brother or full sister) is a sibling with whom an individual shares the same biological parents.Half-siblings only share one parent instead of two as full siblings do (i.e. the children that the parent and stepparent (i.e. mother and stepfather, or father and stepmother) have together). Half-siblings can have a wide variety of interpersonal relationships, from a bond as close as any full siblings, to total strangers.There are specific terms for referring to half-siblings based on the sex of the shared parent:In law (and especially inheritance law) half-siblings were often accorded unequal treatment. Old English common law at one time incorporated inequalities into the laws of intestate succession, with half-siblings taking only half as much property of their intestate siblings' estates as other siblings of full-blood. Unequal treatment of this type has been wholly abolished in England and throughout the United States.Three-quarter siblings have one common parent, while their unshared parents have a mean consanguanuity of 50%. This includes full siblings and parent/child. (Similar terminology is used in horse breeding, where it occurs more frequently). Three-quarter siblings share more genes than half siblings, but fewer than full siblings. There are two genetic scenarios for 3/4 siblings:In this case the unshared parents are full siblings. Further, the three-quarter siblings are also cousins. A possible example was the relationships between Queen Elizabeth I of England and both Henry Carey and Catherine Carey:Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Henry Carey and Catherine Carey were children of Mary Boleyn, the sister of Anne Boleyn. Before Anne's marriage to King Henry, Mary was King Henry's mistress, and King Henry is believed by some to be the father of Henry Carey and Catherine Carey. If so, the two Careys would both be three-quarter siblings of Elizabeth.A more recent example is that of Charles Lindbergh's children with his mistress Brigitte Hesshaimer, and his children with her sister, Marietta Hesshaimer. Another recent example relates to Jermaine and Randy Jackson, of the Jackson 5, who have both fathered children with Alejandra Genevieve Oaziaza.[2]In the case where the unshared parents are identical twins, the children share as much genetic material as full siblings.See also Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907.In this case a woman has children with two men who are father and son (or the genders could be reversed). (This is not incest, as the woman is unrelated to the father and son.) These children will be three-quarter siblings.A "stepsibling" (stepbrother or stepsister) is the child of one's stepparent from a previous or subsequent relationship. Not blood related.Milk brothers or sisters are children breastfed by either a woman who is the mother of one of the two babies, or by someone other than their biological mother, the latter a practice known as wetnursing and once widespread in the developed world, as it still is in parts of the developing world.In Islam those who are fed in this way become siblings to the biological children of their wetnurse, provided that they are less than 2 years old. Islamic law (shariah) codifies the relationship between these people, and certain specified relatives, as rada'a; given that a child is breastfed five fulfilling (satisfactory to him) times, once they are adult, they are mahram, meaning that they are not allowed to marry each other, and the rules of modesty known as purdah are relaxed, as with other family members. But, laws of inheritance do not apply in the case of milk siblings."Foster siblings" are children who are raised in the same foster home, or are also foster children of the person's parents, or foster parents' biological children."Adoptive siblings" are when two children are legally related, but are not related by blood. Adopted siblings are not biologically related but may consider each other siblings because they act like they are."Cross siblings" are not related in any way. Their only connection is that they share one or multiple half-siblings. For example, Michael is the maternal half sibling of Kevin, and the paternal half sibling of Eden. In this case, Kevin and Eden are cross siblings - they share no blood. Not to be confused with stepsiblings."Sibling cousins" are those who have the same mother with their fathers being brothers or cousins or who share the same father with their mothers being sisters or cousins. This is a broader category than, but inclusive of, the 3/4 sibling above.Birth order is a person's rank by age among his or her siblings. Typically, researchers classify siblings as "eldest", "middle child", and "youngest" or simply distinguish between "firstborn" and "later born" children.Birth order is commonly believed in pop psychology and popular culture to have a profound and lasting effect on psychological development and personality. For example, firstborns are seen as conservative and high achieving, middle children as natural mediators, and youngest children as charming and outgoing. In his book Born to Rebel, Frank Sulloway argues that firstborns are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to laterborns. Literature reviews that have examined many studies and attempted to control for confounding variables tend to find minimal effects for birth order on personality.[3][4] In her review of the scientific literature, Judith Rich Harris suggests that birth order effects may exist within the context of the family of origin, but that they are not enduring aspects of personality.[5]Some research has found that firstborn children have slightly higher IQs on average than later born children.[6] However, other research finds no such effect.[7]In practice, systematic birth order research is a challenge because it is difficult to control for all of the variables that are statistically related to birth order. For example, large families are generally lower in socioeconomic status than small families, so third born children are more likely than firstborn children to come from poorer families. Spacing of children, parenting style, and gender are additional variables to consider.The arrival of a new baby is especially stressful for firstborns and for siblings between 3 and 5 years old. Regressive behavior and aggressive behavior, such as handling the baby roughly, can also occur. All of these symptoms are considered to be typical and developmentally appropriate for children between the ages of 35.[citation needed] While some can be prevented, the remainder can be improved within a few months. Regressive behavior may include demand for a bottle, thumb sucking, requests to wear diapers (even if toilet-trained), or requests to carry a security blanket.Regressive behaviors are the child's way of demanding the parents' love and attention.The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests[citation needed] that instead of protesting or telling children to act their age, parents should simply grant their requests without becoming upset. The affected children will soon return to their normal routine when they realize that they now have just as important a place in the family as the new sibling. Most of the behaviors can be improved within a few months.The University of Michigan Health System advises[citation needed] that most occurrences of regressive behavior are mild and to be expected; however, it recommends parents to contact a pediatrician or child psychologist if the older child tries to hurt the baby, if regressive behavior does not improve within 2 or 3 months, or if the parents have other questions or concerns."Sibling rivalry" is a type of competition or animosity among brothers and sisters. It appears to be particularly intense when children are very close in age or of the same gender.[8] Sibling rivalry can involve aggression; however, it is not the same as sibling abuse where one child victimizes another.Sibling rivalry usually starts right after, or before, the arrival of the second child. While siblings will still love each other, it is not uncommon for them to bicker and be malicious to each other.[9] Children are sensitive from the age of 1 year to differences in parental treatment and by 3 years they have a sophisticated grasp of family rules and can evaluate themselves in relation to their siblings.[1] Sibling rivalry often continues throughout childhood and can be very frustrating and stressful to parents.[10] One study found that the age group 1015 reported the highest level of competition between siblings.[11] Sibling rivalry can continue into adulthood and sibling relationships can change dramatically over the years. Approximately one-third of adults describe their relationship with siblings as rivalrous or distant. However, rivalry often lessens over time and at least 80% of siblings over age 60 enjoy close ties.[1]Each child in a family competes to define who they are as persons and want to show that they are separate from their siblings. Sibling rivalry increases when children feel they are getting unequal amounts of their parents' attention, where there is stress in the parents' and children's lives, and where fighting is accepted by the family as a way to resolve conflicts.[10] Sigmund Freud saw the sibling relationship as an extension of the Oedipus complex, where brothers were in competition for their mother's attention and sisters for their father's.[12] Evolutionary psychologists explain sibling rivalry in terms of parental investment and kin selection: a parent is inclined to spread resources equally among all children in the family, but a child wants most of the resources for him or herself.[11]Anthropologist Edvard Westermarck found that children who are brought up together as siblings are desensitized to form sexual attraction to one another later in life. This is known as the Westermarck Effect. It can be seen in biological and adoptive families, but also in other situations where children are brought up in close contact, such as the Israeli kibbutz system and the Chinese Shim-pua marriage.[13][14]The opposite phenomenon, when relatives do fall in love, is known as genetic sexual attraction. This can occur between siblings brought up apart from each other, for example, adoptees who are re-united in adulthood.FamilyKinshipSiblingsCousinMarriageHusbandWifeFriendship

The show aired from June through July of 2011.On August 5, 2010, Rosie O'Donnell announced that she would host a new daytime talk show, The Rosie Show on the channel.[5] The show was cancelled in March 2012, following low ratings and behind-the-scenes turmoil.[6]Reruns of older TLC shows have also been included to fill the daytime schedule, including:
Curtis Stone's Take Home Chef
Say Yes to the Dress
Cash Cab (from sister Discovery Channel)
What Not To Wear

I Shouldn't Be Alive (from sister channel Animal Planet)
Untold Stories of the E.R. (which had also aired on Discovery Health).
Reruns of Dr. Phil (originally syndicated) and Primetime (originally on ABC), along with foreign episodes of Undercover Boss complete the schedule[7]. Movies air sporadically on the channel, mostly overnights and on weekends. Reruns of The Oprah Winfrey Show are rare and sporadic, with episodes that have aired on OWN having come from the series' final season.In August 2011, Winfrey announced that in October 2011, Oprah's Lifeclass would air, showing inspiring guests who appeared previously on The Oprah Winfrey Show. She also announced a free ticket and Lifeclass Journal giveaway for the first one million Americans to join the class online.As of March 2012, programming primarily airs marathons, with eight-hour daytime blocks airing multiple episodes of the same series (a different show each day). The primetime programming varies and is repeated in late night, followed by an overnight movie and a morning block of Dr. Phil. Beginning September 10, 2012, the network added to its morning block Rachel Ray and The Nate Berkus Show. The channel does not air infomercials.In Canada, the former Canadian version of Discovery Health, owned by Shaw Media, does not follow its U.S. equivalent in adopting the OWN format; that channel has now moved to a reality-based format branded as Twist TV.[8] Instead, Corus Entertainment agreed to launch a Canadian version of OWN in early 2011.[9] It was later confirmed that the channel known as Viva was rebranded as OWN on March 1, 2011. During January and February 2011, selected OWN programming aired on both Viva and the co-owned W Network.[10] Both Shaw Media and Corus share common ownership interests from the J.R. Shaw family, but are considered separate companies.[11] Winfrey revealed to The New York Times that she is in final negotiations to release the channel in Brazil and Argentina.[12]During its first week after launch in January 2011, OWN was watched by an average of 505,000 viewers.[13]On March 8, 2011, the channel announced that it would undergo a major overhaul.[14] On May 6, 2011, Discovery executive Peter Liguori replaced Christina Norman as chief executive officer.[15]On July 13, 2011, Winfrey announced she would take over as chief executive officer and chief creative officer of the channel.[16]The average prime-time audience for 2011 was 264,000. As a result, Lisa Erspamer, Executive Vice President of Production and Development, left the network effective January 26, 2012.[17]The channel's losses were estimated to be $330 million.[18]1 Network Executives2 Programming

The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution (written or unwritten) and the rights encoded there in. The law shapes politics, economics and society in countless ways and serves as a social mediator of relations between people.A general distinction can be made between civil law jurisdictions (including Canon and Socialist law), in which the legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and common law systems (including Islamic law), where judge-made binding precedents are accepted. In some countries, religion may inform the law. for example in jurisdictions that practice Islamic law, Jewish law or Canon law.The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. Criminal law deals with conduct that is considered harmful to social order and in which the guilty party may be imprisoned or fined. Civil law (not to be confused with civil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of lawsuits (disputes) between individuals or organizations. These resolutions seek to provide a legal remedy (often monetary damages) to the winning litigant.Under civil law, the following specialties, among others, exist: Contract law regulates everything from buying a bus ticket to trading on derivatives markets. Property law regulates the transfer and title of personal property and real property. Trust law applies to assets held for investment and financial security. Tort law allows claims for compensation if a person's property is harmed. Constitutional law provides a framework for the creation of law, the protection of human rights and the election of political representatives. Administrative law is used to review the decisions of government agencies. International law governs affairs between sovereign states in activities ranging from trade to military action.To implement and enforce the law and provide services to the public, a government's bureaucracy, the military and police are vital. While all these organs of the state are creatures created and bound by law, an independent legal profession and a vibrant civil society inform and support their progress[citation needed].Law provides a rich source of scholarly inquiry into legal history, philosophy, economic analysis and sociology. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice. "In its majestic equality", said the author Anatole France in 1894, "the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread."[3] Writing in 350 BC, the Greek philosopher Aristotle declared, "The rule of law is better than the rule of any individual."[4]In a presidential democracy, the constitution is sovereign and the central institutions for interpreting and creating law are the three main branches of government, namely an impartial judiciary, a democratic legislature, and an accountable executive. In parliamentary systems, the legislature is sovereign and appoints one of its members as the executive (often called the prime minister). The judicial branch is under the parliament.All legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but jurisdictions categorise and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between "public law" (a term related closely to the state, and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and "private law" (which covers contract, tort and property).[5] In civil law systems, contract and tort fall under a general law of obligations, while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or international conventions. International, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, contract, tort, property law and trusts are regarded as the "traditional core subjects",[6] although there are many further disciplines .International law can refer to three things: public international law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of supranational organisations.Constitutional and administrative law govern the affairs of the state. Constitutional law concerns both the relationships between the executive, legislature and judiciary and the human rights or civil liberties of individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the United States and France, have a single codified constitution with a bill of rights. A few, like the United Kingdom, have no such document. A "constitution" is simply those laws which constitute the body politic, from statute, case law and convention. A case named Entick v Carrington[13] illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the Earl of Halifax, was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, Lord Camden, stated that,The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.[14]The fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by John Locke, holds that the individual can do anything but that which is forbidden by law, and the state may do nothing but that which is authorised by law.[15][16] Administrative law is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can apply for judicial review of actions or decisions by local councils, public services or government ministries, to ensure that they comply with the law. The first specialist administrative court was the Conseil d'tat set up in 1799, as Napoleon assumed power in France.[17]Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment.[18] It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevents people from committing a crime in the first place.[19] Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of criminal procedure.[20] The paradigm case of a crime lies in the proof, beyond reasonable doubt, that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or actus reus (guilty act).[21] Second, the accused must have the requisite malicious intent to do a criminal act, or mens rea (guilty mind). However for so called "strict liability" crimes, an actus reus is enough.[22] Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (dolus directus and dolus eventualis), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.[23][24]Examples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in self defence, or pleading insanity. Another example is in the 19th century English case of R v Dudley and Stephens, which tested a defence of "necessity". The Mignonette, sailing from Southampton to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and Richard Parker, a 17 year old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. Lord Coleridge, expressing immense disapproval, ruled, "to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." The men were sentenced to hang, but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the Crown commuted their sentences to six months in jail.[25]Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual victims, but the community as well.[19] The state, usually with the help of police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries cases are cited as "The People v ..." or "R (for Rex or Regina) v ..." Also, lay juries are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact: juries cannot change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone capital punishment for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime will be imprisonment, fines, state supervision (such as probation), or community service. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the social sciences, especially with respect to sentencing, legal research, legislation, and rehabilitation.[26] On the international field, 111 countries are members of the International Criminal Court, which was established to try people for crimes against humanity.[27]Contract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept).[28] In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: offer and acceptance, consideration and the intention to create legal relations. In Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get 100. Many people sued for their 100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an invitation to treat, mere puff, a gimmick. But the court of appeal held that to a reasonable man Carbolic had made a serious offer. People had given good consideration for it by going to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said Lord Justice Lindley, "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".[29]"Consideration" indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of estoppel or culpa in contrahendo, can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.[30] In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding.[31] In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence of wills". Germany has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their 'abstraction principle' (Abstraktionsprinzip) means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)[32] the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. Unjust enrichment law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.[33]Torts, sometimes called delicts, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.[34] Under the law of negligence, the most common form of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for his injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by Donoghue v Stevenson.[35] A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of ginger beer (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a caf in Paisley. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The House of Lords decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness. Lord Atkin took a distinctly moral approach, and said,The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.[36]This became the basis for the four principles of negligence; (1) Mr Stevenson owed Mrs Donoghue a duty of care to provide safe drinks (2) he breached his duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred but for his breach and (4) his act was the proximate cause, or not too remote a consequence, of her harm.[35] Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.[37] Under a nuisance claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as assault, battery or trespass. A better known tort is defamation, which occurs, for example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a politician's reputation.[38] More infamous are economic torts, which form the basis of labour law in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,[39] when statute does not provide immunity.[40]Property law governs valuable things that people call 'theirs'. Real property, sometimes called 'real estate' refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.[42] Personal property, refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as stocks and shares. A right in rem is a right to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a right in personam which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns mortgages, rental agreements, licences, covenants, easements and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, company law, trusts and commercial law. An example of a basic case of most property law is Armory v Delamirie [1722].[43] A chimney sweep's boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three halfpence and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. Lord Chief Justice Pratt ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keeper") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of possession in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something could belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions, that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.[44] By contrast, the classic civil law approach to property, propounded by Friedrich Carl von Savigny, is that it is a right good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts are conceptualised as rights good between individuals.[45] The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our "lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and mix our labour with our surroundings.[46]Equity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the "common law". The common law was administered by judges. The Lord Chancellor on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge made law if he thought it equitable to do so.[47] This meant equity came to operate more through principles than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care of the entrusted property.[48] In the early case of Keech v Sandford [1722][49] a child had inherited the lease on a market in Romford, London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of conflict of interest. The Lord Chancellor, Lord King, agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote,Of course, Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a stock market crash. Strict duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it.[50] This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for charitable purposes, famous examples being the British Museum or the Rockefeller Foundation.Law spreads far beyond the core subjects into virtually every area of life. Three categories are presented for convenience, though the subjects intertwine and overlap.In general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law systems.[54] The term "civil law" referring to a legal system should not be confused with "civil law" as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal or public law. A third type of legal systemaccepted by some countries without separation of church and stateis religious law, based on scriptures. The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international standards. The sources that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislationespecially codifications in constitutions or statutes passed by governmentand custom.[55] Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the Babylonian Codex Hammurabi. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century Eastern Roman Empire whose texts were rediscovered by late medieval Western Europe. Roman law in the days of the Roman Republic and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class.[56] Instead a lay magistrate, iudex, was chosen to adjudicate. Precedents were not reported, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.[57] Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529534 AD the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.[58] This became known as the Corpus Juris Civilis. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."[59] The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the Byzantine Empire. Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the Theodosian Code and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century, and scholars at the University of Bologna used it to interpret their own laws.[60] Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from religious laws such as Canon law, continued to spread throughout Europe until the Enlightenment; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the Code Civil, and Germany, with the Brgerliches Gesetzbuch, modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the Japanese and Korean legal traditions.[61][62] Today, countries that have civil law systems range from Russia and China to most of Central and Latin America.[63] The United States follows the common law system described below.Common law and equity are legal systems where decisions by courts are explicitly acknowledged to be legal sources. The "doctrine of precedent", or stare decisis (Latin for "to stand by decisions") means that decisions by higher courts bind lower courts. Common law systems also rely on statutes, passed by the legislature, but may make less of a systematic attempt to codify their laws than in a "civil law" system. Common law originated from England and has been inherited by almost every country once tied to the British Empire (except Malta, Scotland, the U.S. state of Louisiana, and the Canadian province of Quebec). In medieval England, the Norman conquest led to a unification of various tribal customs and hence a law "common" to the whole country. The common law developed when the English monarchy had been weakened by the enormous cost of fighting for control over large parts of France. King John had been forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass laws. This "great charter" or Magna Carta of 1215 also required that the King's entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at "a certain place" rather than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.[64] A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English judiciary became highly centralised. In 1297, for instance, while the highest court in France had fifty-one judges, the English Court of Common Pleas had five.[65] This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a rigid and inflexible system of common law.[66] As a result, as time went on, increasing numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the Lord Chancellor gave judgment to do what was equitable in a case. From the time of Sir Thomas More, the first lawyer to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own Court of Chancery. At first, equity was often criticised as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor's foot.[67] But over time it developed solid principles, especially under Lord Eldon.[68] In the 19th century the two systems were fused into one another. In developing the common law and equity, academic authors have always played an important part. William Blackstone, from around 1760, was the first scholar to describe and teach it.[69] But merely in describing, scholars who sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law actually worked.[70]Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the Jewish Halakha and Islamic Shariaboth of which translate as the "path to follow"while Christian canon law also survives in some church communities. Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments.[citation needed] However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. For instance, the Quran has some law, and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation,[71] Qiyas (reasoning by analogy), Ijma (consensus) and precedent. This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as Sharia and Fiqh respectively. Another example is the Torah or Old Testament, in the Pentateuch or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The Halakha is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's interpretations. Nevertheless, Israeli law allows litigants to use religious laws only if they choose. Canon law is only in use by members of the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Anglican Communion.Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced throughout the Muslim world in a non-codified form, with the Ottoman Empire's Mecelle code in the 19th century being first attempt at codifying elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions.[72][73] In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia.[74] Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law.[75] Iran has also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.[76] During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of Islamic resurgence has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected world politics.[77]The history of law is closely connected to the development of civilization. Ancient Egyptian law, dating as far back as 3000BC, contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of Ma'at, characterised by tradition, rhetorical speech, social equality and impartiality.[78][79] By the 22nd centuryBC, the ancient Sumerian ruler Ur-Nammu had formulated the first law code, which consisted of casuistic statements ("if ... then ..."). Around 1760BC, King Hammurabi further developed Babylonian law, by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as stelae, for the entire public to see; this became known as the Codex Hammurabi. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British Assyriologists, and has since been fully transliterated and translated into various languages, including English, German, and French.[80]The Old Testament dates back to 1280BC and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society. The small Greek city-state, ancient Athens, from about the 8th century BC was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry, excluding women and the slave class. However, Athens had no legal science or single word for "law",[81] relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law (thmis), human decree (nomos) and custom (dk).[82] Yet Ancient Greek law contained major constitutional innovations in the development of democracy.[83]Roman law was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated.[84][85] Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the Roman Empire, law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major codification under Theodosius II and Justinian I.[86] Although codes were replaced by custom and case law during the Dark Ages, Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medival legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. In medival England, royal courts developed a body of precedent which later became the common law. A Europe-wide Law Merchant was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property.[87] As nationalism grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The Napoleonic and German Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging.[88] EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the European Court of Justice.Ancient India and China represent distinct traditions of law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The Arthashastra, probably compiled around 100AD (although it contains older material), and the Manusmriti (c.100300AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance.[89] Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and Pluralism, and was cited across Southeast Asia.[90] This Hindu tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the British Empire.[91] Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and Hong Kong also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.[92] Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the French, but mostly the German Civil Code.[93] This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late 19thcentury. Similarly, traditional Chinese law gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the Ch'ing dynasty in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.[94] Today Taiwanese law retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists, who fled there, and Mao Zedong's communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People's Republic of China was heavily influenced by Soviet Socialist law, which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights.[95] Due to rapid industrialisation, today China is undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from administrative domination.[96] Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the World Trade Organisation.[97]"But what, after all, is a law? [...] When I say that the object of laws is always general, I mean that law considers subjects en masse and actions in the abstract, and never a particular person or action. [...] On this view, we at once see that it can no longer be asked whose business it is to make laws, since they are acts of the general will; nor whether the prince is above the law, since he is a member of the State; nor whether the law can be unjust, since no one is unjust to himself; nor how we can be both free and subject to the laws, since they are but registers of our wills."The philosophy of law is commonly known as jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence is essentially political philosophy, and asks "what should law be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks "what is law?" John Austin's utilitarian answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".[99] Natural lawyers on the other side, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of "natural law" emerged in ancient Greek philosophy concurrently and in entanglement with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of Western culture through the writings of Thomas Aquinas.Hugo Grotius, the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulseas Aristotle had indicatedand reason.[100] Immanuel Kant believed a moral imperative requires laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature".[101] Jeremy Bentham and his student Austin, following David Hume, believed that this conflated the "is" and what "ought to be" problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's positivism; that real law is entirely separate from "morality".[102] Kant was also criticised by Friedrich Nietzsche, who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the will to power, and cannot be labelled as "moral" or "immoral".[103][104][105]In 1934, the Austrian philosopher Hans Kelsen continued the positivist tradition in his book the Pure Theory of Law.[106] Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity"; meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway is 500); law tells us what we "should" do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (Grundnorm) instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, Carl Schmitt, rejected both positivism and the idea of the rule of law because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.[107] Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception (state of emergency), which denied that legal norms could encompass of all political experience.[108]Later in the 20th century, H. L. A. Hart attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in The Concept of Law.[109] Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book Law's Empire, Ronald Dworkin attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an "interpretive concept",[110] that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. Joseph Raz, on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in The Authority of Law.[111] Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to sociology, rather than jurisprudence.[112]In the 18th century Adam Smith presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics.[113] The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. antitrust law. The most influential proponents, such as Richard Posner and Oliver Williamson and the so-called Chicago School of economists and lawyers including Milton Friedman and Gary Becker, are generally advocates of deregulation and privatisation, and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of free markets.[114]The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs.[116] Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes.[117] Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.[37] Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves house that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this.[118] So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.[119] Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.[120]Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, economic analysis of law and more specialised subjects such as criminology.[121] The institutions of social construction and legal frameworks are the relevant areas for the discipline's inquiry. At first, legal theorists were suspicious of the discipline. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, Eugen Ehrlich, who sought to make distinct the differences between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.[122][123]Around 1900 Max Weber defined his "scientific" approach to law, identifying the "legal rational form" as a type of domination, not attributable to people but to abstract norms.[124] Legal rationalism was his term for a body of coherent and calculable law which formed a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state and developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism.[121] Another sociologist, mile Durkheim, wrote in The Division of Labour in Society that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.[125] Other notable early legal sociologists included Hugo Sinzheimer, Theodor Geiger, Georges Gurvitch and Leon Petraycki in Europe, and William Graham Sumner in the U.S.[126][127]It is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man, in such manner as if every man should say to every man: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou givest up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent courts, representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, bureaucratic organisation, the legal profession and civil society itself. John Locke, in his Two Treatises of Government, and Baron de Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws, advocated for a separation of powers between the political, legislature and executive bodies.[128] Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp all powers of the state, in contrast to the absolutist theory of Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan.[129]Max Weber and others reshaped thinking on the extension of state. Modern military, policing and bureaucratic power over ordinary citizens' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers such as Locke or Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the legal profession is an important part of people's access to justice, whilst civil society is a term used to refer to the social institutions, communities and partnerships that form law's political basis.A judiciary is a number of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this is the Supreme Court;[130] in Australia, the High Court; in the UK, the Supreme Court;[131] in Germany, the Bundesverfassungsgericht; in France, the Cour de Cassation.[132][133] For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the Council of Europe member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.[134]Some countries allow their highest judicial authority to overrule legislation they determine to be unconstitutional. For example, in Brown v. Board of Education, the United States Supreme Court nullified many state statutes that had established racially segregated schools, finding such statutes to be incompatible with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[135]A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, just as all other government bodies are. In most countries judges may only interpret the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the doctrine of precedent. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of parliamentary sovereignty, whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.[136]In communist states, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary.[137] In Muslim countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt may invalidate such laws,[138] and in Iran the Guardian Council ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the "criteria of Islam".[138][139]Prominent examples of legislatures are the Houses of Parliament in London, the Congress in Washington D.C., the Bundestag in Berlin, the Duma in Moscow, the Parlamento Italiano in Rome and the Assemble nationale in Paris. By the principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out their wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are unicameral, most countries are bicameral, meaning they have two separately appointed legislative houses.[140]In the 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller constituencies. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent states in a federal system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a house of review. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.[140]To pass legislation, a majority of the members of a legislature must vote for a bill (proposed law) in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution may be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the United States or Brazil).[141]The executive in a legal system serves as a government's centre of political authority. In a parliamentary system, as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of the legislature. The executive is chosen by the Prime Minister or Chancellor, whose office holds power under the confidence of the legislature. Because popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party can change in between elections.[142]The head of state is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the German president (appointed by members of federal and state Parliaments) the Queen of the United Kingdom (a hereditary title), and the Austrian president (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the presidential system, found in France, the U.S. and Russia. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature to which it is not accountable.[142][143]Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for foreign relations, the military and police, and the bureaucracy. Ministers or other officials head a country's public offices, such as a foreign ministry or interior ministry. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country's approach to government.While military organizations have existed as long as government itself, the idea of a standing police force is relatively modern concept. For example, Medival England's system of traveling criminal courts, or assizes, used show trials and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain control.[144] The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century Paris, in the court of Louis XIV,[145] although the Paris Prefecture of Police claim they were the world's first uniformed policemen.[146]Max Weber famously argued that the state is that which controls the monopoly on the legitimate use of force.[147][148] The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term failed state refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.[149]The etymology of "bureaucracy" derives from the French word for "office" (bureau) and the Ancient Greek for word "power" (kratos).[150] Like the military and police, a legal system's government servants and bodies that make up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the earliest references to the concept was made by Baron de Grimm, a German author who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and intendants are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist.[151]Cynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public servants is typically contrasted to private enterprise motivated by profit.[152] In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have bureaucracies.[153] Negative perceptions of "red tape" aside, public services such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are a crucial state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power.[153]Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support.[154] Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, management is composed of career experts, who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants' discretion with rules.[155]A corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to be able to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of an advocate in a court proceeding emanates from this corollaryin England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor (solicitor).[157] As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.[158]In order to maintain professionalism, the practice of law is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a bar association, bar council or law society. Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a Bachelor of Laws, a Bachelor of Civil Law or a Juris Doctor degree[159]), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment (being admitted to the bar). Most Muslim countries have developed similar rules about legal education and the legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.[160] In China and other developing countries there are not sufficient professionally-trained people to staff the existing judicial systems, and, accordingly, formal standards are more relaxed.[161]Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a law firm, in a chambers as a sole practitioner, in a government post or in a private corporation as an internal counsel. In addition a lawyer may become a legal researcher who provides on-demand legal research through a library, a commercial service or through freelance work. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely.[162]Significant to the practice of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring case-law reports, legal periodicals and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court pleadings, persuasive briefs, contracts, or wills and trusts. Negotiation and dispute resolution skills (including ADR techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.[162]Classical republican concept of "civil society" dates back to Hobbes and Locke.[163] Locke saw civil society as people who have "a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them."[164] German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel distinguished the "state" from "civil society" (burgerliche Gesellschaft) in Elements of the Philosophy of Right.[165]Hegel believed that civil society and the state were polar opposites, within the scheme of his dialectic theory of history. The modern dipole statecivil society was reproduced in the theories of Alexis de Tocqueville and Karl Marx.[166][167] Nowadays in post-modern theory civil society is necessarily a source of law, by being the basis from which people form opinions and lobby for what they believe law should be. As Australian barrister and author Geoffrey Robertson QC wrote of international law,... one of its primary modern sources is found in the responses of ordinary men and women, and of the non-governmental organizations which many of them support, to the human rights abuses they see on the television screen in their living rooms.[168]Freedom of speech, freedom of association and many other individual rights allow people to gather, discuss, criticise and hold to account their governments, from which the basis of a deliberative democracy is formed. The more people are involved with, concerned by and capable of changing how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and legitimate the law becomes to the people. The most familiar institutions of civil society include economic markets, profit-oriented firms, families, trade unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, debating clubs, non-governmental organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and religious associations.[169]1 Legal subjects

The sources for public international law development are custom, practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the Geneva Conventions. Public international law can be formed by international organisations, such as the United Nations (which was established after the failure of the League of Nations to prevent the Second World War),[7] the International Labour Organisation, the World Trade Organisation, or the International Monetary Fund. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the International Court of Justice as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience.[8] However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.[9]Conflict of laws (or "private international law" in civil law countries) concerns which jurisdiction a legal dispute between private parties should be heard in and which jurisdiction's law should be applied. Today, businesses are increasingly capable of shifting capital and labour supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas businesses, making the question of which country has jurisdiction even more pressing. Increasing numbers of businesses opt for commercial arbitration under the New York Convention 1958.[10]European Union law is the first and, so far, only example of a internationally accepted legal system other than the UN and the World Trade Organisation. Given the trend of increasing global economic integration, many regional agreementsespecially the Union of South American Nationsare on track to follow the same model. In the EU, sovereign nations have gathered their authority in a system of courts and political institutions. These institutions are allowed the ability to enforce legal norms both against or for member states and citizens in a manner which is not possible through public international law.[11] As the European Court of Justice said in the 1960s, European Union law constitutes "a new legal order of international law" for the mutual social and economic benefit of the member states.[12]Labour law is the study of a tripartite industrial relationship between worker, employer and trade union. This involves collective bargaining regulation, and the right to strike. Individual employment law refers to workplace rights, such as job security, health and safety or a minimum wage.Human rights, civil rights and human rights law are important fields to guarantee everyone basic freedoms and entitlements. These are laid down in codes such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights (which founded the European Court of Human Rights) and the U.S. Bill of Rights. The Treaty of Lisbon makes the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union legally binding in allmember states except Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  Poland and the United Kingdom.[51]Civil procedure and criminal procedure concern the rules that courts must follow as a trial and appeals proceed. Both concern a citizen's right to a fair trial or hearing.Evidence law involves which materials are admissible in courts for a case to be built.Immigration law and nationality law concern the rights of foreigners to live and work in a nation-state that is not their own and to acquire or lose citizenship. Both also involve the right of asylum and the problem of stateless individuals.Social security law refers to the rights people have to social insurance, such as jobseekers' allowances or housing benefits.Family law covers marriage and divorce proceedings, the rights of children and rights to property and money in the event of separation.Company law sprang from the law of trusts, on the principle of separating ownership of property and control.[52] The law of the modern company began with the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856, passed in the United Kingdom, which provided investors with a simple registration procedure to gain limited liability under the separate legal personality of the corporation.Commercial law covers complex contract and property law. The law of agency, insurance law, bills of exchange, insolvency and bankruptcy law and sales law are all important, and trace back to the medival Lex Mercatoria. The UK Sale of Goods Act 1979 and the US Uniform Commercial Code are examples of codified common law commercial principles.Admiralty law and the Law of the Sea lay a basic framework for free trade and commerce across the world's oceans and seas, where outside of a country's zone of control. Shipping companies operate through ordinary principles of commercial law, generalised for a global market. Admiralty law also encompasses specialised issues such as salvage, maritime liens, and injuries to passengers.Intellectual property law aims at safeguarding creators and other producers of intellectual goods and services. These are legal rights (copyrights, trademarks, patents, and related rights) which result from intellectual activity in the industrial, literary and artistic fields.[53]Restitution deals with the recovery of someone else's gain, rather than compensation for one's own loss.Unjust enrichment When someone has been unjustly enriched (or there is an "absence of basis" for a transaction) at another's expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.Space law is a relatively new field dealing with aspects of international law regarding human activities in Earth orbit and outer space. While at first addressing Space relations of countries via treaties, increasingly it is addressing areas such as space commercialization, property, liability, and other issues.Tax law involves regulations that concern value added tax, corporate tax, income tax.Banking law and financial regulation set minimum standards on the amounts of capital banks must hold, and rules about best practice for investment. This is to insure against the risk of economic crises, such as the Wall Street Crash of 1929.Regulation deals with the provision of public services and utilities. Water law is one example. Especially since privatisation became popular and took management of services away from public law, private companies doing the jobs previously controlled by government have been bound by varying degrees of social responsibility. Energy, gas, telecomms and water are regulated industries in most OECD countries.Competition law, known in the U.S. as antitrust law, is an evolving field that traces as far back as Roman decrees against price fixing and the English restraint of trade doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the Sherman Act and Clayton Act) of the turn of the 20th century. It is used to control businesses who attempt to use their economic influence to distort market prices at the expense of consumer welfare.Consumer law could include anything from regulations on unfair contractual terms and clauses to directives on airline baggage insurance.Environmental law is increasingly important, especially in light of the Kyoto Protocol and the potential danger of climate change. Environmental protection also serves to penalise polluters within domestic legal systems.Book: LawJurisprudenceHuman rightsEconomicsHistoryPolitical sciencePhilosophy of lawRule of lawRule according to higher lawAhmad, Ahmad Atif.

The series focuses on a girl who lives a double life as an average teenage school girl named Miley Stewart (played by Miley Cyrus) by day and a famous pop singer named Hannah Montana by night, concealing her real identity from the public, other than her close friends and family.The series has been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program from 2007 through 2010.[1][2] Hannah Montana: The Movie was released in theaters on April 10, 2009. The third season of the series premiered on November 2, 2008 and ended on March 14, 2010. The show was renewed for the fourth and final[3] season, which started production on January 18, 2010, and ended production on May 14, 2010.[4] The final season premiered on July 11, 2010,[5][6] and became the last Disney Channel sitcom to transition from standard definition to high definition in the process. The fourth season of Hannah Montana was promoted as Hannah Montana Forever.[7] The one-hour series finale aired on January 16, 2011.[8]Michael Poryes, who is credited as co-creator, also co-created the hit Disney Channel Original Series That's So Raven. The show is produced by It's a Laugh Productions, Inc. and Michael Poryes Productions, in association with Disney Channel Original Productions. It is filmed at Sunset Bronson Studios in Hollywood, California.The original idea for this show was based on the That's So Raven episode "Goin' Hollywood", which served as the backdoor pilot for a sitcom tentatively called Better Days to star Alyson Stoner, in which a child star of a popular TV show of the same name was to try her hand at going to a normal school. The episode "New Kid in School" has the basic premise as that aforementioned episode. Former American Juniors finalist Jordan McCoy, future Gossip Girl actress Taylor Momsen and pop and R&B singer JoJo (who rejected the role)[9] were considered for the role of Chloe Stewart. Miley Cyrus originally auditioned for the role of the "best friend"[10] Lilly Romero,[citation needed] later changed to Lilly Truscott, but they thought she would be better for the main character, so she tried out for Chloe Stewart/Hannah Montana. Chloe Stewart was later changed to Miley Stewart when Cyrus got the part.[11] The names of Hannah Montana were changed a few times. Three of the previous names were Anna Cabana, Samantha York, and Alexis Texas.[citation needed]In December 2006, Disney announced plans to release Hannah Montana products, including clothing, jewelry, apparel, and dolls, at selected stores.[12] Play Along Toys released the Hannah Montana fashion dolls, singing dolls, Miley Stewart doll, and other merchandise in August 2007. More Hannah dolls were released in November, along with Oliver, Lilly, and later Jake Ryan dolls. They became one of the most popular Christmas toys in 2007.[13]According to the Daily Dispatch, the TV series held a global audience of 200million viewers in 2008. "If Mileys viewers were a country, they would be the fifth largest population in the world  just ahead of Brazil."[14] By February 2008, the Hannah Montana franchise had become so important that Disney convened an "80-person, all-platform international meeting to discuss Hannah Montana's future."[15] All Disney business segments were represented at the meeting.The theme song for Hannah Montana is "The Best of Both Worlds" written by Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil, produced by Gerrard and performed by Miley Cyrus (as Hannah Montana). John Carta, who also composed the music cues to signify scene changes and commercial breaks for the first season, composed the music for the song. The song's lyrics describe the basic premise of the television series.The full-length version of the song, which is 2 minutes, 54 seconds in length, was included on the show's soundtrack, released in October 2006. For the TV version of the theme, which lasts only 50 seconds, only the first two stanzas and the last two were used. "Just Like You" and "The Other Side of Me" were originally tested for the opening theme song, before "Best of Both Worlds" was chosen as the theme.The opening sequence for the first two seasons features episode clips of each cast member when their name appears. Each cast member's name is "wiped" on the screen in a marquee-light-style. The sequence then switches to full-screen episode clips (most of the clips used in the Season One version of the sequence were of the early produced episodes) with the creator's names appearing in the second-to-last clip. The show's title logo design appears at the beginning and end of the sequence (the latter portion on the "concert stage" features Cyrus as her character Hannah Montana). The only change to the sequence for season two were the replacement of episode clips and the addition of the Disney logo above the show's title logo.For season three, a new version of the opening credits was used. It features Miley as herself and Hannah Montana in a Times Square-like setting. The names of the actors and actresses and clips from the show appear in a sort-of marquee board and it features Hannah Montana with her new wig and clothes style. The song playing is a remixed version of "The Best of Both Worlds", that was originally recorded for (and heard in) Hannah Montana: The Movie. This marked the first time that a Disney Channel series has completely revamped its opening title sequence. The sequence was reformatted for high definition and slightly altered for season four, with the credit typing changed, the addition of the "Forever" wording in the main title logo, the removal of Mitchel Musso from the credit sequence and the inclusion of clips from season four episodes.On August 23, 2007, Buddy Sheffield sued Disney over Hannah Montana, alleging that he originally came up with the idea for Hannah Montana, but was never compensated by Disney. In the lawsuit, Sheffield claims that he pitched an idea for a TV series with the name of "Rock and Roland" to Disney Channel in 2001 with the plot of a junior high student who lived a secret double life as a rock star. The lawsuit claims that Disney Channel executives at first liked the idea, but passed on the series.[16]On April 9, 2010, Hannah Montana co-creators Rich Correll and Barry O'Brien filed a lawsuit against Disney for $5million over profits from the show. Correll and O'Brien claim they were denied their fair share of profits and pre-negotiated percentage-based bonuses based on their backend deals and WGA requirements for writers who receive "created by" credits. Correll, who also directed a number of episodes of series, also claims that he was unfairly terminated and blackballed by Disney after testifying in connection with a WGA arbitration. A spokesperson says Disney is declining to comment on the suit. Michael Poryes, the third Hannah Montana creator, sued Disney on similar grounds in October 2008.[17]Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert is a concert film from Walt Disney Pictures presented in Disney Digital 3-D. The limited release was intended to be for one week, February 17, 2008 in the US and Canada with release in other countries later on, but was extended for viewing as long as theaters wanted. Disney announced the concert was filmed in several cities to be theatrically released in the US in February and internationally that month. The film uses 3-D glasses.The opening weekend, February 13, 2008, the movie had gross revenue of $31.1million. It was the number one movie of the weekend. Opening in only 638 theaters, it set a record of over $42,000 per theater. It set a record for the highest revenue for a 3-D movie for one weekend.Hannah Montana: The Movie is the musical film adaptation of the American teen sitcom Hannah Montana. Filming began in April 2008,[18] much of it occurring in Columbia, Tennessee,[19] and Los Angeles, California,[20][21][22] and was completed in July 2008.[23] The film was released on April 10, 2009 in the United States and Canada.[24]The series premiere was watched by 5.4 million viewers, the highest premiere ever for a Disney Channel series. The episode Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas is the most watched episode of Hannah Montana, scoring 10.7 million viewers. It is also the highest rated series (beating That's So Raven in popularity).[citation needed] AOL TV placed the show in its list of TV's Biggest Guilty Pleasures.[25]Hannah Montana is broadcast on the following stations around the world: Lithuania EstoniaHannah Montana at TV.com1 Production

Distributed in U.S. by Disney-ABC Domestic Television, ABC Studios produced the series, which was its first foray into broadcast syndication, with Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, Joshua Donen, Ned Nalle and Kenneth Biller serving as executive producers. The show premiered on November 1, 2008 and ran for two seasons before its cancellation in 2010.The series follows the epic journeys of a young woods guide named Richard Cypher (Craig Horner), a mysterious woman named Kahlan Amnell (Bridget Regan), a wizard named Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander (Bruce Spence), and a warrior named Cara (Tabrett Bethell) as they defend against tyranny and destruction. The story depicted in the television series greatly differs from that as portrayed in the written series.The story takes place in the world author Terry Goodkind created in his The Sword of Truth fantasy novel series. The three main provinces are Westland, the Midlands and D'Hara. Westland is separated from the Midlands by a magical boundary, which was created to prevent any magic from entering Westland. On the other side of the Midlands is D'Hara, which is ruled by Darken Rahl. An ancient order of women known as Confessors oversee the welfare of the people of the Midlands.The first season is loosely based on the first book of The Sword of Truth series Wizard's First Rule. Some of the stories feature events and characters not encountered in the books, while others loosely adapt events from the book. The story begins after the invasion of Darken Rahl's army into the Midlands. Kahlan Amnell, a Confessor, ventures into Westland in search of a wizard and the Seeker, who has been prophesied to defeat Rahl. Kahlan finds the wizard, Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander, and the Seeker, Richard Cypher, who is forced to accept his destiny. Together, they set off on a journey to seek out and defeat Darken Rahl. They soon discover that in the process of defeating Darken Rahl, they unintentionally helped the Keeper of the underworld create tears in the veil which separates the underworld from the world of the living. Richard's quest in the second season is to find the Stone of Tears to seal the rifts between the worlds and defeat the Keeper.The series premiered on November 1, 2008 in the United States and was broadcast weekly on Saturday or Sunday, depending on the local television station. It is based on the novel Wizard's First Rule. In addition to the 22 episodes of the first season, the series was renewed by Disney for a second season.[1] All aired episodes from the first season are currently free online at Hulu.Filming of the second season started in July 2009; it was based on the sequel to Wizard's First Rule, Stone of Tears. The first episode aired on November 7, 2009. The season consisted of 22 episodes. Streamable episodes appeared on the show's official website, HuluPlus, and Netflix.[2] They are currently available on Netflix and HuluPlus for active members (monthly subscription required).Sam Raimi became interested in adapting The Sword of Truth novels after his business partner Joshua Donen encouraged him to read the books,[3] and he in turn gave the books to Robert Tapert to read.[4] Raimi considered adapting the first book into a movie or a five-part miniseries, but later settled on making a weekly television series after speaking to the books' author Terry Goodkind.[3] A weekly television program would allow them to include most of the stories and important aspects of the series. Goodkind had resisted selling the rights of his books on multiple occasions before he met Raimi because he was not confident that other producers would maintain the integrity of his stories and characters.[5] Raimi, who had produced Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess with Tapert and Ned Nalle, saw this as an opportunity to return to the first-run syndicated television business. However, the syndicated television business had diminished after the loss of crucial foreign markets[6] and a gradual conversion of independent stations to UPN and WB programming that left little room for other syndicated dramas.ABC Studios agreed to fund the project, making it its first venture into broadcast syndication, and greenlit the production for 22 episodes, after it was cleared for broadcast to stations representing 84% of the United States, with Tribune Company being the primary launch group.[7] The show, which is heavily action-oriented and requires visual effects, was given a "network-sized" production budget of US$1.5 million per episode.[6][8]Originally named Wizard's First Rule (after the first book in The Sword of Truth series), the show was retitled to Legend of the Seeker at Goodkind's suggestion since the producers wanted to differentiate the show from the books, it would have been too restrictive for them to only include plotlines from the first book, and because this would allow them the opportunity to cover the story within all the books in the series.[5]Executive producers Raimi and Tapert intended Legend of the Seeker to be "just about telling the stories of these characters and the sacrifices they make for each other. Sometimes it's about the meaning of real friendship. And always, it's the stories of the hero's journey."[9] Tapert added, "We didn't want to have the '90s postmodern attitude where the audience is in on the joke. Seeker is much more serious than Hercules and Xena."[10]With show's production based in New Zealand and a writing staff based in Los Angeles, one of the biggest challenges has been dealing with the time differences and the communication issues.[11] Kenneth Biller noted that the biggest challenges the writing staff faced were to create standalone episodes while integrating the storylines and mythology created by Terry Goodkind, and to "honor the books without literally translating them".[11] As such, the series contains some stories from the books and new stories and events created by the series' writers. Raimi's reason for the changes is that the structure of a novel differs from a weekly one-hour television program.[12] Tapert and Raimi maintain that while the writers have had to create events that are not portrayed in the books, they have remained faithful to the characters, themes and overarching story of the books:...I think the most important thing, at least for me, is that we remain true to the heart and soul of the characters, what they represent, what they stand for, the good things that they're fighting for, what are their weaknesses and how to overcome them, what the villain represents to the hero, the love story. Those will all be intact and brought as close as possible by our writers to the screen. The actual plot of it, though, happens in a slightly different order and sometimes different stories will be told, as depicted in the series of novels.Goodkind released a message to his readers on his official website prior to the show's production saying:[13]No series (or mini-series, or feature film) can follow the underlying book exactly. Sam Raimi and his team want to keep the TV series true to my vision, so rest assured that I am going to be intimately involved in the writing of each of the episodes. If you love the book just the way it is, then enjoy the book for what it is and come to the TV series prepared to enjoy the show for what it is.However, after production started Goodkind released another press statement in response to questions posed to him by fans:I want you all to understand that ABC studios chose not to consult me on actors, scripts, or any other aspect of the show. I have had no input whatsoever on the TV series, so I am the wrong person to write to or complain about the show. If you wish to make comments, positive or negative, please direct them to Disney/ABC. For my part, I trust in Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert to at some point be able to exert their immense creative talent and do a great job at bringing to life the characters we all love.When casting the role of Richard Cypher, Tapert recalled that when he saw Craig Horner's audition tape, he "absolutely thought he was the guy, instantly".[12] Raimi thought that although Horner is older than the character he plays (even though he really isn't), he was "very believable" and that "he's got enough good qualities in him, in real life, and he will probably make the audience believe that he's taking that ride towards making a responsible person and that growth of character that's so important for me in the stories of Terry Goodkind."[12] Horner had not heard of the books prior to the audition, and was convinced by a friend to read the books and try out for the role.[14]For the role of Kahlan Amnell, Raimi credits Tapert for finding Bridget Regan, whom he saw on one of the audition tapes they received. Raimi thought that she grounded the fantastical situations by being "very human and real", and recalled, "I was moved by her and I believed her and I thought we couldn't ask for anything more."[12] Like Horner, Regan had not read the books prior to the audition.[15] Horner and Regan were brought together for a "chemistry reading" in Los Angeles, upon which the producers concurred that they had found their two lead actors.[12]Production was set to begin in May 2008, but it was delayed by six weeks.[7][16] The series was shot entirely in New Zealand in high-definition. Though based in Auckland, filming took place in various places in and outside of the city: at Henderson Valley Studios,[17] in the city's outskirts and in the mountainous region around Queenstown.[16]Tribune, the major distributor of the series, decided not to renew the series on March 4, 2010, but according to a statement from ABC Studios,[18] this was not a deciding factor of its cancellation. After an apparent deal with Syfy fell through,[19] on April 26 Ausiello Files reported that Legend of the Seeker had been cancelled and would not return for a third season.[20] Fans of the series responded by launching an ongoing renewal campaign titled "Save Our Seeker".[21][22][23] Terry Goodkind has expressed his support for the campaign.[24][25][26]Legend of the Seeker premiered on the weekend of November 12, 2008 in the United States and attracted more than 4.1 million viewers over the two days.[27] The first two episodes obtained an average of 1.5/3 Nielsen rating among 54 metered markets with a 1.4/3 rating on Saturday and a 1.7/3 rating on Sunday. In addition to improving its broadcast time periods in several top markets, Legend also improved the audience numbers in the key 18 to 49 year old demographic in all airings.[28] Over its first month of airing, the show averaged more than 3.6 million viewers.[29] It was renewed for a second season after obtaining a 2.0 household rating average for its first ten episodes.[1]The series premiere, which consisted of the first two episodes, received generally mixed reviews from critics, earning a 53 out of 100 average rating as calculated by Metacritic.[30] It was criticized for not being as "fun" as Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess (also produced by Robert Tapert and Sam Raimi),[31] and not having enough excitement.[32] Another major complaint about the show was its lack of distinguishing features and that it was "too derivative of other works" like Star Wars, The Matrix, and The Wheel of Time, with the "300-style" slow-motion action sequences often cited as an example.[31][33][34] Brian Lowry from Variety called the show "a hodgepodge of better sci-fi/fantasy fare",[33] while Ray Richmond from The Hollywood Reporter described it as "[b]ig on style but more challenged in terms of substance" with "too little provocative/evocative interaction aside from the ultra-violent kind".[35]Legend of the Seeker was praised for its high production value and the use of New Zealand exteriors,[33][34][35][36] with Robert Lloyd from Los Angeles Times commenting that the show is basically "good-looking fun".[37] Although both Lloyd and Diane Steenbergen from IGN commended the performances of the lead actors Craig Horner and Bridget Regan, they were not pleased with the supporting performances.[33][34][37] Steenbergen thought that the series' third episode was "far more entertaining than the previous two that were weighed down with too much exposition."[38]In 2009, the series won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series. In 2010, the series was nominated for an Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music Emmy. In 2011, Costume Designer Jane Holland, Cinematographer KevinRiley, and Sound Designer ChrisBurt all won awards at the Aotearoa Film & Television Awards for their outstanding work in Legend of the Seeker.In addition to the United States, broadcast rights for Legend of the Seeker have been picked up in more than 60 international markets.[39] In Spain, the show began airing on Telecinco on March 15, 2009.

J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci. It premiered on the Fox Broadcasting network on September 9, 2008. The series follows Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble), members of a Federal Bureau of Investigation "Fringe Division" team based in Boston, Massachusetts under the supervision of Homeland Security. The team uses "fringe" science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe. The series has been described as a hybrid of The X-Files, Altered States, and The Twilight Zone.The series format combines elements from procedural dramas as well as those found in serials. The series began as a more traditional "mystery of the week" series, and became more serialized in later seasons. A majority of episodes contain a standalone plot, with several episodes also exploring the series' overarching mythology.Early critical reception of the first season was lukewarm but became more favorable in subsequent seasons, when the series began to explore its mythology, including parallel universes and alternate timelines. The show, as well as the cast and crew, has been nominated for many major awards. Despite its move to the "Friday night death slot" and low ratings, the series has received a cult following. The series has been renewed for a fifth and final season consisting of 13 episodes, which premiered on September 28, 2012. The series has also spawned two six-part comic book series and an alternate reality game.The series will conclude on January 18, 2013, with a two-hour series finale.[1]Fringe follows the casework of the Fringe Division, a Joint Federal Task Force supported primarily by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which includes Agent Olivia Dunham; Dr. Walter Bishop, the archetypal mad scientist; and Peter Bishop, Walter's estranged son and jack-of-all-trades. They are supported by Phillip Broyles, the force's director, and Agent Astrid Farnsworth, who assists Walter in laboratory research. The Fringe Division investigates cases relating to fringe science, ranging from transhumanist experiments gone wrong to the prospect of a destructive technological singularity to a possible collision of two parallel universes. The Fringe Division's work often intersects with advanced biotechnology developed by a company called Massive Dynamic, founded by Walter's former partner, Dr. William Bell, and run by their common friend, Nina Sharp. The team is also watched silently by a group of bald, pale men who are called "Observers".Season 1 introduces the Fringe Division as they investigate cases that form "the Pattern", many of which orchestrated by an international network of rogue scientists known as ZFT (Zerstrung durch Fortschritte der Technologie, or in English, Destruction through Advancement of Technology), led by David Robert Jones, who are preparing for a doomsday event. The ZFT threat appears to end when Peter kills Jones as he attempts travel to a parallel universe.[2] Olivia comes to learn she was a child test subject for Walter years ago for a nootropic drug, Cortexiphan, giving her weak psionic abilities.[3] Walter also struggles with adjusting to normal life in Peter's care after living seventeen years in a mental institution while hiding the fact that Peter is from the parallel universe, "his" Peter having died as a child.[2]In Season 2, the occurrences are found to be in conjunction with activities of a parallel universe, which is plagued by singularities occurring at weakened points of the fabric between worlds; over there, scientists have developed an amber-like substance that isolates these singularities as well as any innocent people caught in the area on its release. The Fringe team deals with more cases that are leading to a "great storm" as the parallel universe appears to be at war with the prime one, engineered by human-machine hybrid shapeshifters from the parallel universe.[4] Walter is forced to tell Peter that he is from the parallel universe, a replacement for his own Peter that died from a genetic disease. Walter had crossed over on the frozen ice of Reiden Lake in 1985 to administer the cure for the alternate version of Peter, but, after destroying a dose of the cure upon transport, he instead brought the boy across; on return, they fell through the ice but were saved by the Observer September, reminding him of the importance of Peter.[5] Walter's crossing is what caused the singularities in the parallel universe, with Reiden Lake at their epicenter.[6]Season 3 presents episodes that alternate between the two universes. "Walternate", Walter's doppelgnger in the parallel universe, is the U.S. Secretary of Defense and has set events in motion to assemble a doomsday device that reacts only to Peter's biology.[7] He also sent his Olivia, "Fauxlivia", to the prime universe, in Olivia's place, to engage the Fringe Division and assemble the prime universe's version of the device, while he studies Olivia's Cortexiphan-induced powers.[8] By happenstance, Fauxlivia becomes pregnant with Peter's child, Henry, before being outed and extracted to the parallel universe.[9] Walternate orchestrated acceleration of the pregnancy to gain a sample of the baby's blood, which he uses to activate the machine.[10] Peter, with Olivia's help, enters the prime version of the machine, and experiences a vision of the future where the parallel universe has been destroyed and the same fate threatens the prime one. Recovering in the present, Peter alters his plan and uses the machine to merge the two rooms, creating a bridge where inhabitants of both universes can solve their dilemma, before disappearing and being forgotten by both Walters and Olivias.[11]Season 4 begins in an alternate timeline, one in which September had failed to save the alternate version of Peter in 1985, according to the Observers.[12] This creates a butterfly effect influencing the main characters' pasts but otherwise stabilizing both universes due to the creation of the bridge. Peter is pulled into this new timeline due to the actions of the alternate timeline's Fringe team, which includes Lincoln Lee. Peter initially works to return to his own timeline, fueled by fears that his memories are altering Cortexiphan-dosed Olivia's of this timeline, but after encountering a wounded September, Peter comes to learn that this timeline is truly his home, and both he and Olivia come to accept the change, rekindling their affair.[13] September also reveals to Peter that the Observers needed to erase Peter's son, Henry, to assure their future will be created, though noting that Peter's future child with Olivia will be important.[14] Meanwhile, in the present, William Bell has instructed David Robert Jones, alive in this timeline, to work with the parallel universe's version of Nina Sharp to synchronize the two universes together, aiming to collapse them both and pave the way for a third universe under Bell's control, using Olivia's Cortexiphan powers to enable the collapse. The Fringe division is forced to close the dimensional bridge, but this fails to stop Bell's plan. Walter is left with one choice, to shoot and kill Olivia, her death disrupting the process; Bell manages to get away, while Walter removes the bullet and allows the Cortexiphan to restore Olivia to life. The Fringe division is given a larger budget, while Olivia learns she is pregnant with Peter's child. September appears to Walter and warns that "they are coming",[15] alluding to a dystopian future of 2036 depicted in the episode "Letters of Transit", where Observers from the far future, having ruined Earth for themselves, time-traveled to 2015 and instituted "The Purge", wiped out much of humanity, subjected the survivors to their control, and began modifying the planet's environment to be more suitable for themselves.[16]The fifth and final season continues from the 2036 of "Letters of Transit"; the Fringe team was able to seal themselves in amber to avoid capture shortly after the Purge, but are re-united in the future due to actions of Peter and Olivia's now-adult daughter, Henrietta (Etta). Walter reveals that he and September had developed a plan to defeat the Observers before he was trapped in amber, but after briefly taken and tortured by the lead Observer, Captain Windmark, that plan has been lost in his mind.[17] The Fringe team recounts that Walter documented everything, and they find a series of tapes, ambered within Walter's old lab, that instructs the viewer to collect components to complete the plan. Etta is killed by the Observers during an ambush, creating a martyr figure for the resistance while leading Peter to lethally remove a device implanted in an Observer's spine and insert it in himself as to become like the Observers himself. Peter uses the abilities of the implant to plot against Captain Windmark, while Olivia fears that she may be losing Peter again.Much of the story arc for Fringe involves a parallel universe that mostly mirrors the prime universe, but with numerous historical idiosyncrasies. A significant example element used is the effect of the September 11 attacks; though this event also occurred in the parallel universe, the World Trade Center was untouched by the attacks, leaving the buildings as predominate landmarks in the parallel world's "Manhatan" skyline, and used as the offices of Dr. William Bell in several episodes.[18][19]The producers were strongly interested in "world building", and the parallel universe plot device allowed them to create a very similar world with a large amount of detail to fill in the texture of the world. A parallel universe would also allow them to show "how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line", according to co-director Jeff Pinkner.[20] However, the producers also realize the concept of the parallel universe could be confusing to viewers and have introduced elements of the world in small pieces over the course of the first two seasons before the larger reveal in the second season finale and third season. J.H. Wyman stated that he would often pass the story ideas for the parallel universe by his father to see if it made sense, and would rework the script if his father found it confusing.[21] Such world building also gave them a risky opportunity to create stories that focused solely on characters from the parallel universe with nearly no ties to the main characters; as stated by Wyman, they would be able to "make two shows about one show", a concept that the network executives embraced.[22]Prior to commercial breaks, a brief image of a glyph is shown. Abrams revealed in an interview that the glyphs had a hidden meaning. "It's something that we're doing for people who care to figure it out and follow it, but it's not something that a viewer has to consider when they watch the show."[23] Abrams also revealed that the seemingly unrelated frogs which have the Greek letter Phi () imprinted on their back appeared in promos for the show have significance within the context of the series, saying "it's part of the code of the show."[23] The glyph code was cracked by an editor at the technology site Ars Technica, who discovered it to be a simple substitution cipher used to spell out a single thematic word for each episode.[24] Whether there is a further second-order code to be solved remains to be seen. Additionally, the glyphs are representative of some of the means by which Walter solves a case (the Moth/Butterfly from "Johari Window", the Seahorse strain of DNA from "The Bishop Revival"). In "Jacksonville", behind Walter as he speaks to Olivia about her treatment is the daycare wall where the nootropic Cortexiphan was used as a trial, each of the glyphs is clearly visible. An episode-by-episode key to the various glyphs was made available on Fringepedia.[25]The show's standard opening sequence interplays images of the glyph symbols alongside words representing fringe science topics, such as "teleportation" and "dark matter". Within the third season, with episodes that took place primarily in the parallel universe, a new set of titles was used, following a similar format, though tinted red instead of blue and using alternate fringe science concepts like "hypnosis" and "neuroscience". The difference in color has led some fans to call the prime universe the Blue one in contrast to the parallel Red one.[26] In the third season episode "Entrada", the titles used a mix of both the blue- and red-tinted versions, given the episode taking place equally in both universes.[27] In the show's two flashback episodes, "Peter" and "Subject 13", a variation on the sequence, using retro graphics akin to 1980s technology and phrases like "personal computing" and "genetic engineering", was used.[28] For the dystopian future third season episode "The Day We Died", a black-toned theme, with more dire phrases like "hope" and "water," was used.[29] The fourth season premiere, "Neither Here Nor There" introduced an amber-toned title sequence with additional new terms that is used for nearly all season four episodes.[30] The fourth season episode "Letters of Transit", which returned to the future dystopian universe, and the subsequent fifth season episodes, feature a cold-toned title sequence with phrases such as "joy", "private thought" and "free will", ideas which have been lost in this future.[31] There is one frame in the opening sequence in which the words "Observers are here" flash very quickly, and the opening sequence must be paused to see them.[32]Co-created by J. J. Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, Fringe is produced by Bad Robot in association with Warner Bros. Television, as part of a commitment that Abrams previously made with the studio.[38] At the time, Abrams was working with Orci and Kurtzman on the Star Trek film, and used them to brainstorm ideas for the show.[38]Abrams's inspiration for Fringe came from a range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the film Altered States, films by David Cronenberg, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone.[38][39] Orci stated that Fringe is a "new kind of storytelling", combining procedural shows such as Law & Order, and an "extremely serialized and very culty" series like Lost.[40] The procedural aspect was chosen because, at the time of its premiere, six of the ten top shows were procedural in nature; Orci stated that "you have to be a fool not to go study what it is that they're doing".[38] Though the team saw this as a way of presenting "mystery of the week"-type episodes, they wanted to focus more on how these stories were told in unpredictable ways rather than the actual mystery, recognizing that most of their target audience has seen such mysteries before through previous shows and films.[40] Instead, they wanted their storytelling to be original and unexpected, and, as claimed by Kurtzman, one of the most challenging aspects of developing the individual episodes.[40]In considering the serialization aspect, Abrams recognized the difficulties that his earlier serialized shows, such as Lost and Alias, had in attracting and maintaining viewers that had not seen these shows from the start or who missed episodes sporadically, and sought to rectify that for Fringe, creating, as stated by David Itzkoff of the New York Times, "a show that suggested complexity but was comprehensible in any given episode".[38]One method was by introducing overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to, such as "The Pattern" in Season 1, providing information repeatedly about the larger plot over the course of several episodes or seasons.[38]Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear, avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of Alias.[38]A final step taken was to script out all of the major long-running plot elements, including the show's finale, prior to full-time production.Abrams contrasted this to the process used in Lost, where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to the viewers. Instead, with Fringe, they were able to create "clearly defined goalposts" (in Itzkoff's words) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot.[38] These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered the show's fate if known at the start.Abrams stated that "There are certain details that are hugely important that I believe, if shared, will destroy any chance of actually getting on the air."[38] Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from "how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long-term stories that we want to tell".[40]During the third season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that "We have six to eight seasons worth of material. We see it as having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story, but aren't necessary to tell the overall story. God willing, the network allows us the time to tell our complete story."[41]As part of the larger story, the writers have placed elements in earlier episodes that are referenced in episodes seasons later. For example, in the first season episode "The Ghost Network", the Fringe team encounters an amber-like substance, which is later shown to be a critical means to combat the breakdown of the parallel universe and eventually for the same in the prime universe with the third season episode "6B".[22] Pinkner compared this aspect to "planting seeds", some which they know how they plan to use later in the show's story, while others they can find ways of incorporating into these later episodes.[22]He further attributed these elements as part of the "world building" to flesh out the show beyond episodic content.[22] The producers have stated that when the show's mythology is introduced, it is not simply there to tie episodes together, but "to provide answers that generate consequences".[42]The show's main characters, Olivia, Peter, and Walter, were core of the concept for Fringe. They recognized early that "the idea that telling a father-son story and a relationship story was a really compelling one and a very accessible one", according to Kurtzman.[40] They were able to provide the characters with backstories that, like with other long-term plot elements, could be alluded to over several episodes and seasons.[40]The characters would also contrast with the typical procedural genre show; rather than having clearly defined roles episode to episode, they instead "have an emotional memory and an emotional investment", as stated by Orci.[40] This also allowed for, as necessary, characters to be removed or introduced to the show and have a larger impact on the other characters.[40]Jeff Pinkner was selected to act as the head showrunner and executive producer. Abrams noted that he trusts Pinkner after working together with him on Alias and Lost.[43] In season two, J.H. Wyman was brought on as executive producer and showrunner with Jeff Pinkner. Michael Giacchino, Abrams' frequent collaborator, composed the music for the pilot of Fringe, before handing over duties to his assistants Chad Seiter and Chris Tilton; Tilton took over scoring duties from Season 2 onward.[44] While Giacchino retains an on-screen credit, Abrams himself wrote the series theme music.[45]The two-hour pilot episode, filmed in Toronto, Canada, cost a total of $10 million to create.[46] A basement of an old church was used for Walter's lab set in the pilot, and this set was replicated at other film sites in New York and Vancouver when the show moved.[47] John Noble called his character's lab "the heart and soul of Fringe", so consequently, "That has to remain constant."[47] A cow used in the pilot episode had to be recast when production of Season 1 was moved to New York, due to livestock restrictions preventing it from being brought from Canada to the United States.[48][49] Other locations used in the first season included other universities to stage for the Harvard University campus, where Walter's lab is located. These included Pratt Institute and Yale University,[50] including its Old Campus (particularly Phelps Hall and Durfee Hall), Branford College, and the exterior of Yale Law School, University of Toronto's University College, Brooklyn College.[50]On February 21, 2009, it was reported that in the event that Fringe would be renewed for a second season The show would move production to Vancouver from New York City as a cost-cutting measure.[51] Executive producer Jeff Pinkner explained:"We want to stay in New York, New York has been incredibly good to us. It feels like we're being kicked out of the city. I know we're not, but they're making it impossible for us to afford doing the show... Our New York crew is spectacular, they've worked their [butts] off to make the show look great. But it looks like New York is not renewing a tax credit that makes it possible to make our budget in New York. So it looks like, out of necessity, we'll have to leave New York, which is not anything we are welcoming."[52]Upon productions moving to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for season 2, the University of British Columbia now stands in for Harvard.[50] The area around New Westminster often serves as filming locations for Fringe stories that take place in the parallel universe.[53][54]Prior to the start of production for the fifth season, Pinkner announced that he was leaving the production of the show to pursue other projects; Wyman would remain as the sole showrunner for the show.[55]The first actors cast were Kirk Acevedo and Mark Valley, who portrayed FBI agents Charlie Francis and John Scott, respectively.[56][57] John Noble and Lance Reddick, who play Dr. Walter Bishop and Homeland Security agent Phillip Broyles, joined the cast later on.[58][59] Casting of Anna Torv, Blair Brown, and Jasika Nicole, who play Olivia Dunham, Massive Dynamic employee Nina Sharp, and Astrid Farnsworth, a federal agent and assistant to Olivia Dunham, respectively, followed;[60] while Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop, was the last main character to be cast.[61] Jackson auditioned for James T. Kirk in Abrams' Star Trek and believed this is what impressed the producer to cast him in his television project.[62]On April 8, 2009, it was announced that Leonard Nimoy would appear as Walter Bishop's former lab partner, Dr. William Bell in the first season's finale, which explores the existence of an ominous parallel universe. This choice led one reviewer to question if Fringe's plot might be a homage to the Star Trek episode "Mirror, Mirror", which explored the concept of an alternate reality referred to as a "mirror universe", and an evil version of Spock distinguished by a goatee.[63] Nimoy returned as Dr. Bell for an extended arc, and according to Orci, Bell is "the beginning of the answers to even bigger questions."[64][65] Nimoy reprised his role in the second season finale, where his character and Walter met for a "showdown".[66] Nimoy's character is apparently dead after the season finale, having used himself to help Walter, Peter and the Alternate Olivia back to the prime universe. As he had retired from acting, it was thought unlikely that his character would return.[67] In February 2011 however, he announced his definite plan to return to Fringe and reprise his role as William Bell.[68] He returned to voice the character in the animated segments of the third season episode "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide",[69] and appeared as a computer-generated character in the fourth season episode "Letters of Transit".[70] In the two-part finale of the fourth season, Nimoy returned to play the ultimate antagonist of the alternate timeline story arc.The first season of Fringe was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on September 8, 2009 in region 1.[71][72] In addition to all the episodes that had been aired, extras include three commentary tracks, unaired scenes, gag reels and behind the scenes features. A "Fringe Pattern Analysis" feature is included on the Blu-ray version as an exclusive. The sets were released on September 28, 2009 in region 2[73] and on September 30, 2009 in region 4.[74]The second season features four commentary tracks, a gag reel, deleted scenes, behind the scenes videos, and the episode "Unearthed", an episode, produced for the first season, which aired out of schedule during the second season. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 14, 2010 in region 1,[75][76] on September 27, 2010 in region 2,[77] and on November 10, 2010 in region 4.[78]The third season features two commentary tracks, a gag reel, behind the scenes videos, and two features exclusive to the Blu-ray version. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 6, 2011 in region 1,[79][80] on September 26, 2011 in region 2,[81] and on October 26, 2011 in region 4.[82]The fourth season includes several special features, including "The Culture of Fringe", a roundtable discussion with series writers and university professors regarding the science featured in the series; features on how the disappearance of Peter affects the timeline, and the role of the Observers; two features covering the Fringe comic series; and a gag reel.[83] It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 4, 2011 in region 1,[84] on September 24, 2012 in region 2,[85] and on October 31, 2012 in region 4.[86]An alternate reality game, centered on the fictional Massive Dynamic corporation, was introduced during the pilot and featured "strange symbols paired with glowing dots" appearing throughout the episode and an "advertisement" for the company shown at the end with a web address for the game.[87]On August 27, 2008, a prequel comic book (leading right up to the moment in the pilot where Olivia 'first' meets Walter) written by Zack Whedon, the series was released by DC Comics under its WildStorm imprint.[88][89] This was to be the first issue of a monthly 6-issue limited series but the others were delayed until January 2009, when monthly publication resumed, with the sixth and final issue scheduled for release on June 17.[90] The Vice President of WildStorm, Hank Kanalz, explained the publication hiatus: "The writers of the show want to make sure the comic book is integrated into the mythology of the Fringe world, so we have decided to refocus the direction of the comic book. Unfortunately, this means that we will have some delays, but will be back in January."[91]On June 23, 2010, the first issue of Tales From the Fringe, the second six-part monthly series, was released, while the final issue was released on November 24, 2010.[92]Additionally, in September 2011, DC released the first issue of Beyond the Fringe comic series. With the first story written by Joshua Jackson titled "Peter and the Machine". The comic issues will alternate with an 'A' story and a 'B' story each. For example, "Peter and the Machine" will take place in issues one, three, and so on until the story is finished and a new 'A' story starts up.[93]At San Diego Comic-Con 2012, actor John Noble mentioned that a film could be made further down the line.[94]Early reception through the first season was generally lukewarm. The pilot episode was watched by 9.13 million viewers, garnering 3.2/9 Nielsen ratings among adults 1849, with ratings improving over the course of the episode.[95] Ratings improved greatly for the second episode, "The Same Old Story" which 13.27 million people watched, making it the fifth most watched show of the week.[96] As of October 2008, the show had achieved the first place in the 1849 demographic among new shows.[97] As a whole, the series was well received by the critics.Barry Garron at Hollywood Reporter found it promising because "it is reminiscent of battle-of-the-sexes charm."[98] Robert Bianco, of USA Today, said, "What Abrams brings to Fringe is a director's eye for plot and pace, a fan's love of sci-fi excitement, and a story-teller's gift for investing absurd events with real emotions and relatable characters."[99] Travis Fickett of IGN gave it 7.6 out of 10, calling it "a lackluster pilot that promises to be a pretty good series."[100] While Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle remarked that it was "boundlessly ambitious",[101] Chicago Sun-Times's Misha Davenport called it an "update of The X-Files with the addition of terrorism and the office of Homeland Security."[102]In its 2008 Year in Review, Television Without Pity declared Fringe one of the year's biggest TV disappointments, commenting that the show is "entertaining" and "the cast is largely strong" but the character development is insufficient.[103] The show's main character, Olivia Dunham, is "wooden and distant, and after half a season, we still haven't gotten to know her."[103] The untrustworthy Nina Sharp is well acted but "one-note and lazily written," and Lance Reddick's character is also "underdeveloped."[103]The Daily Herald commented that Fringe is promising and "it may yet develop into a worthwhile program" but has "largely been spinning its wheels".[104] Meanwhile, in other articles recounting the best and worst of 2008, The New York Times stated that Fringe "is the best of a rash of new series that toy with the paranormal." The author goes on to praise the cast saying that "Much credit belongs to Anna Torv who stars as an F.B.I. agent investigating bizarre murders that all appear to be linked to a powerful and mysterious multinational corporation," and "Ms. Torv is backed up ably by John Noble as a crazy but brilliant fringe scientist and his level-headed but skeptical son, played by Joshua Jackson."[105]Changes in the approach and storytelling of the show in the second and subsequent seasons led to more positive critical reception and made it a media favorite. Entertainment Weekly stated, "The best new show of the year took a few weeks to grow on me, but now it's a full-blown addiction."[106] The Los Angeles Times called Walter Bishop one of the best characters of 2008, noting, "the role of the modern-day mad scientist could so easily have been a disaster, but the 'Fringe' writers and the masterful John Noble have conspired to create a character that seems, as trite as it sounds, more Shakespearean than sci-fi."[107]Chicago Tribune stated that some episodes are "distressingly predictable and formulaic" but adds that there have also been some excellent episodes.[52] The New York Times named Fringe one of the top 10 television shows in 2010.[108] while Television Without Pity, previously dismissive of the show, listed it amongst their 2010 "Most Memorable TV Moments", stating "there were so many great Fringe moments this year" and "we were treated to some of the best sci-fi on television this past fall."[109]The A.V. Club named Fringe the 15th best show of 2010, stated that the episode "Peter" gave "the series' overarching storyline a devastating emotional core", making the series a "rare blend of inventive ideas, wild ambition, and unexpected soulfulness".[110] IGN named Fringe the 18th best science fiction show of all time in a 2011 listing, stating that since the middle of the first season, "it's been nothing but a series of satisfyingly jaw-dropping 'holy eff!' moments layered with wonderful, nuanced performances from Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson and John Noble".[111]In 2012, Entertainment Weekly listed the show at #17 in the "25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years," saying, "Fringe was conceived as a mass-appeal genre procedural, with a background mythology that wouldn't detract from monster-of-the-week episodes. ... But the mythology overtook the monsters following the revelation of a parallel universe. By its third season, Fringe was overpopulated by multiple versions of every character. Unfortunately, that increasing narrative complexity has steadily pigeonholed it as a niche show."[112]The following is a table of seasonal U.S. rankings (based on total viewers per episode including reruns) of Fringe on Fox.Fringe premiered in the 2008 United States television season at a regular timeslot of 9:00 pm Eastern on Tuesdays. During Season 1, Fringe was part of a Fox initiative known as "Remote-Free TV". Episodes of Fringe were longer than standard dramas on current network television. The show ran with half the commercials, adding about six minutes to the show's runtime.[126] When the show went to a commercial, a short bumper aired informing the viewer of roughly how much time commercials would consume before the program resumed. The pilot episode was leaked via BitTorrent, three months before the series premiere; similar to leaked fellow Fox series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.[127] The series was renewed for a second season on May 4, 2009,[128] and moved to 9:00 pm on Thursday.[129]It was renewed for a third season on March 6, 2010.[130] As part of a reorganization of its 2010 midseason line up to capture more market for American Idol, the Fox network shifted Fringe to 9:00 pm on Fridays. This timeslot, commonly considered the "Friday night death slot" for several previous Fox shows due to cancellation shortly following the move to that slot, left critics considering the show's fate. While The X-Files originally premiered during this slot and would continue to be a highly successful series, critics were unsure if Fringe could duplicate this performance. In this slot, the show competed with Supernatural, a series that attracts similar types of viewers.[131] Fox's Entertainment President Kevin Reilly, in response to these concerns, stated that 45% of Fringe's viewership is from time shifting recording through digital video receivers, and does not expect the viewership numbers to change significantly with the change to Friday. Reilly further postulated that "If it does anywhere near what it did on Thursdays, we can glue that show to the schedule because it can be a big win for us".[132] Further promoted by the critical reaction to the rescheduling, the Fox network created a self-deprecating promotional advertisement acknowledging the reputation of the time slot, including quotes from other media outlets concerned about the move, but asserted that the move would "re-animate" the show.[133][134] The network also created a music video, set to "Echoes" by the band Klaxons as a means of summarizing the third season to date prior to the first Friday broadcast.[135] Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop on the show, cautioned that time-shifted viewership may not be enough to save the show: "It's not that not enough people are watching Fringe, it's that not enough people are watching Fringe during the hour that it's on the air, which is key for the network."[136]Producers Pickner and Wyman also were excited about the move to Fridays, considering the slot as "open territory that can be conquered" and that they "can actually deliver like The X-Files did".[137] Series creator Abrams was less optimisic of the move to Friday nights, aware that the show's likelihood to be renewed for a fourth season would be highly dependent on the number of niche viewers that continue to watch the show.[138] Abrams did affirm that moving to Friday nights allows them to take more creative freedoms to maintain viewership in the new timeslot, but feels that if the show was not renewed for another season, they would be "hard pressed" to resolve the story by the end of the third season.[138]The show's first episode at the Friday 9:00 pm timeslot ("The Firefly") scored a 1.9 in the key 1849 demographic which was an increase of 12% over its last Thursday-aired episode ("Marionette") which scored a 1.7,[139] and maintained similar numbers in the second week for "Reciprocity".[140] Though viewership slipped in further weeks, the show was renewed for a fourth season in March 2011. The move was unexpected based on these ratings, given the past performance of shows with similar viewership numbers in the Friday night slot, but several critics attribute it to the strong fanbase that the show has garnered, which contributes in part to consistently higher time-shifted viewership.[141] Fox's Reilly stated that:Reilly further added that the renewal was also prompted by the high risk of trying to replace Fringe with another show with unknown viewership metrics; he commented that they "have a far better shot of sticking with a show that has an audience that [they] think [they] can grow".[143] Prior to the onset of the fourth season, Reilly reiterated that they do not expect any significant growth in Fringe's viewership within that season: "Its a pretty complex show. If Fringe can do exactly what Fringe did last year, were going to be very happy. Theyre right in the pocket creatively once again."[144] Wyman stated in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter that the Fox network had been "supportive throughout this process", and though the show's viewership "wasn't exactly what they would've hoped for", aspects such as a loyal fan base and supportive critics were enough to take the show forward for another season.[145] Pinkner commented that "there were no creative conditions" on the show's renewal, nor any cuts in the show's budget, though was unsure if the show will be moved to a different time slot.[146] Noble, at the 2011 Comic-Con Fringe panel, reiterated that the fans were responsible for the livelihood of the show, stated, "Seriously, without your efforts, your rabid support, we wouldnt be here right now. You are the best fans that ever existed".[147] The fourth season premiered on September 23, 2011.[148]Before the renewal of the fifth season, Abrams stated some skepticism for a renewal opportunity, but hoped that if it was cancelled, that it may be picked up by another network. On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, "the next year would be the great ending for the show".[149] Similarly, Fox's Reilly remained cautious about a renewal, noting that while the show is one of the top shows in the Friday night slot, "it's an expensive show. We lose a lot of money on the show."[149] Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success.[149] When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, "That's a Peter Roth issue" (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television).[150] To which Roth responded, "We have no plans to give viewers closure this season because we expect the series to continue".[151] In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show.[152] Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated "We want to take care of the fans. We want them to see where it would have gone, but we also know the show has been a commitment and we want everyone to be satisfied with it."[153]The show was officially renewed for a fifth and final season for the 20122013 television season, consisting of a shortened set of 13 episodes, on April 26, 2012.[154] Reilly, in announcing the renewal, stated that "Fringe is a remarkably creative series that has set the bar as one of television's most imaginative dramas. Bringing it back for a final 13 allows us to provide the climactic conclusion that its passionate and loyal fans deserve".[155] The Fox network latter affirmed that the fifth season will start with the onset of the 2012-2013 television season in September 2012.[156]Fringe premiered in Canada on CTV simultaneous to its U.S. premiere and was the most watched program in Canada that week.[157] The show would fluctuate between airing on CTV and A during its first two seasons. Beginning with the third season, Fringe was broadcast on Citytv in Canada.[158]A version of the show (edited for time) premiered on the Nine Network in Australia on September 17, 2008. In the season one episode "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones", the scene in the introduction where the doctors discover a parasite on Detective Loeb's heart was censored and just went straight to the opening credits.[159] Nine Network later dropped the show from its primetime schedule temporarily;[160] the show returned during the December to January non-ratings period.[161] The series premiered in the UK on Sky1 on October 5, 2008.[162]By greenlighting 13 episodes for the final fifth season, Fringe will have a total of 100 episodes, a critical number for syndication deals for Warner Bros., and considered part of the reason for the show's final renewal. The show has already been announced for syndication on the Science Network.[163]Fringe and its cast and crew have been nominated and won several awards including Emmys, Saturn Awards, Golden Reel Awards, Satellite Awards, and Writers Guild of America Awards.Fringe at TV.comOfficial tie-in sitesScience fictionThrillerHorrorMysteryDramaJ.

The series details events surrounding a high school football team from a fictional town called Dillon: a small, close-knit community in rural Texas. Particular focus is given to team coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) and his family. The show uses this small town backdrop to address many issues facing contemporary American culture, including school funding, racism, drugs, abortion, and lack of economic opportunities.Produced by NBCUniversal, Friday Night Lights premiered on October 3, 2006, airing for two seasons on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Although the show had garnered critical acclaim and passionate fans, the series suffered low ratings and was in danger of cancellation after the second season. To save the series, NBC struck a deal with DirecTV to co-produce three more seasons of the show with each subsequent season premiering on DirecTV's 101 Network after which NBC rebroadcast the series a few months later.[1] The series ended its run on The 101 Network after five seasons on February 9, 2011.[2][3][4]Friday Night Lights never obtained a sizable audience.[5] It was a critical success, however, lauded for its realistic portrayal of Middle America and deep personal exploration of its central characters. The show appeared on a number of best lists and was awarded a Peabody Award, a Humanitas Prize, a Television Critics Association Award, and several technical Primetime Emmy Awards. At the 2011 Primetime Emmy Awards the show was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series. Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton also scored multiple nominations for the Outstanding Lead Actor and Actress awards for a drama series. Executive producer Jason Katims was also nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. Both Chandler and Katims won the Emmy in 2011.[6]Friday Night Lights takes its inspiration from the non-fiction book Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream and the 2004 film based on it. The book, published in 1990 and written by H.G. "Buzz" Bissinger, details the 1988 season of the Permian Panthers, a high school football team in Odessa, Texas. The book itself was intended as a work of journalism and is assumed to be completely factual. The characters in the book are not renamed, and the book makes no attempt to conceal their identities.[7] The Universal Pictures film, which stars Billy Bob Thornton and was directed by Bissinger's second cousin Peter Berg, based its characters on the real-life residents of Odessa c. 1988.Once filming on the movie was completed, Berg turned his attention to adapting the story for television. Berg later expressed that he regretted having to jettison many of the interpersonal topics from the book because of the time constraints of a feature film. Creating a TV series, particularly one based on fictional characters, allowed many of those elements to be brought back and addressed in-depth.[8]The show chose not to use Odessa as the setting and instead used it as inspiration for the fictionalized town of Dillon, Texas, though the football team did retain the Panthers name. Berg made a number of conscious choices in carrying elements from the film to the series, such that much of the work that went into the creation of the pilot duplicated the work that was done on the film.[9] One of these choices included casting Connie Britton to play Head Coach Eric Taylor's wife and Brad Leland to play football booster Buddy Garrity, in roles similar to the ones they played in the film.[10][11]Filming for the show's Austin, Texas-based pilot began in February 2006. Berg described filming the pilot and eventually the show in Texas as "a deal breaker" for his weekly participation in the project. The show features a number of homages to its Texas heritage. In filming the pilot, Berg ensured this homage by featuring Texas Longhorn coach Mack Brown as a Dillon booster and having a caller to the fictional "Panther Radio" compare Panthers' coach Eric Taylor to Brown.[12] The pilot also incorporated much of the surrounding area. Football scenes for the pilot were filmed at Pflugerville High School's Kuempel Stadium and at the RRISD Complex. The Dillon Panther football team and coaches' uniforms were based heavily on the uniforms of the real life Pflugerville Panthers. Additionally, some of the scenes were filmed at Texas School for the Deaf.[13]In addition to physical locations, characters in the show were inspired by Berg's observation of local high school students while preparing to film the movie. For example, Jason Street, the character whose promising football career is ended by a spinal injury in the pilot, was inspired by a real-life incident in which David Edwards, a player from San Antonios Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when the incident took place and it had a profound effect on him, leading him to base the pilot around a similar incident.[14]Though scripted like any hour-long television drama, the show's producers decided at the outset to allow the cast leeway in what they said and did on the show, including the delivery of their lines and the blocking of each scene. If the actors felt that something was not true to their character or a mode of delivery didn't work, they were free to change it provided they still hit the vital plot points.[15]The freedom given to the cast was complemented by the fact that the show was filmed without rehearsal and without extensive blocking. Camera operators were trained to follow the actors, rather than the actors standing in one place and having cameras fixed around them. This allowed the actors to not only feel free to make changes but to feel safe in making those changes because the infrastructure would work around them. Executive producer Jeffrey Reiner described this method as "no rehearsal, no blocking, just three cameras and we shoot."[16]Working in this fashion had a profound influence on everyone involved with the show, with series star Kyle Chandler going so far as to say "When I look back at my life, I'm going to say, 'Wow, [executive producer] Peter Berg really changed my life.'"[17] Executive producer and head writer Jason Katims echoed this sentiment, saying "When I first came on [the FNL] set, I thought, its interesting  this is what I imagined filmmaking would be, before I saw what filmmaking was."[18]All five seasons of Friday Night Lights were filmed in Austin and Pflugerville, though discussions at the close of the first season considered a possible move to New Mexico or Arizona.[19] Enjoying roughly $33 million a year in revenue from the show,[20] both states were aggressive in courting the production company after the State of Texas failed to pay all of the rebates that were promised to the show's producers.[19] The show remained in Austin, however, as a result of Texas passing legislation to match the offers of other states and the production company having a preference to stay in the Austin area.[20]Friday Night Lights is unusual in its use of actual locations as opposed to prefabricated stage sets and its lack of any sound stage for filming. This, along with the production team using hundreds of locals as extras, gives the series an authentic look.[21]The drive towards authenticity continued in the show's documentary style filming technique, which employed three cameras for each shoot and shot entire scenes in one take; most productions film a scene from each angle and typically repeat the scene several times while readjusting lighting to accommodate each shot. The first takes usually made the final cut. By filming a scene all at once, the producers tried to create an environment for the actors that was more organic and allowed for the best performances.[22]This desire for authenticity in the production extended to the football games as well, with the series making heavy use of the uniforms, cheerleaders, fans, and the stadium of the real-life Pflugerville Panthers. Producers even shot Pflugerville games and used them as game footage in the show.[23] Added to that were real life University of Southern California football announcers Peter Arbogast and Paul McDonald who provided off-screen commentary during the football game sequences. The facilities, colors, and bobcat logos of Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas served as the setting and creative inspiration for the fictional Texas Methodist University. The field's name on the show is Herrmann Field, named after George Herrmann, the head coach of the Pflugerville Panthers.On June 20, 2010 scenes were filmed at Temple University, depicted as the fictional Braemore College instead.One episode, from Julie's senior year in high school, was filmed in Boston, at Boston College,[24] Boston University, and Tufts University.Some scenes at fictional Oklahoma Tech University were filmed at Gregory Gym at The University of Texas at Austin.[25]The show was initially targeted at the youth market and focused heavily on the football element. NBC teamed with social networking site Bebo to create a site that allowed students to upload video and photos, as well as create blogs about their local football teams. Students who participated were eligible for one of ten $5,000 scholarships. The focus of this promotion was a deal that would provide NBC and the show promotion on Bebos network of youth oriented sites including Piczo, Hi5, Tickle, Ringo and FastWeb.[26]To complement this promotion, NBC sent out School Spirit kits to 1,000 high schools around the country. These kits included posters, pom-poms, mini-footballs and disposable cameras all bearing the shows logo. The kits also contained copies of the shows Pilot episode on DVD.[27] This promotional trick was something the network returned to for its second season promotion, when it teamed with HouseParty.com to send out 1,000 "Party Kits" which contained advance copies of the Season 2 opener along with other promotional material.[28]NBC also paired with Toyota to create the "Hometown Sweepstakes," in which students could earn cash grants of up to $50,000 for their schools athletic program. It was open to high-school students ages 14 to 18 and was designed to draw people to the shows official web site, where they could download AOL Instant Messenger Icons, screensavers, and desktop wallpaper. Students that registered could also download free movie theater passes to special early screenings of the pilot episode. These movie theater screenings took place in 50 cities nationwide and ran until a week before the show premiered on NBC.[29]This early strategy caused several marketing problems for the long term, the most notable of which was the lack of female viewers. The early marketing campaign created an audience of almost exclusively young men and repelled women with its football-heavy slant.[citation needed] This in turn deprived the show of a large audience who would enjoy the more character-driven elements.Given this dilemma, NBC chose to aggressively switch course and pursue the female demographic in the later part of the season. The network designed a strategy based around accentuating the personal elements of the show, even going so far as to rechristen the show with the tagline "Its about life." NBC Marketing President Vince Manze stressed that their goal was to let people know the show was not just about football but about family and relationships as well.The network again took their case to movie theaters by running 30-second spots featuring cast members and fans being interviewed about the show.[30]NBC has been aggressive in its online promotion of Friday Night Lights. Streaming videos such as cast interviews and the full episode from the previous week have been available on NBC.com since the series inception. In December 2006, NBC expanded this selection to include every episode of the season. The move to offer every episode was made for only a few select shows and represents a marketing push on NBC's part.[31] Beyond NBC.com it was announced on March 14, 2007 that the show would be part of an expanded lineup available via MobiTV.[32]In addition to the free ad-support offerings, every episode of Friday Night Lights became available for download on the iTunes Store on February 10, 2007 for $1.99 per episode. As a special promotion, the pilot was initially offered as a free download.[33] The first 2 seasons are now on Zune Marketplace. All five seasons of Friday Night Lights are available for streaming from the Netflix "On Demand" subscription service. Currently, seasons 4 and 5 are available on Hulu Plus.The second series initially aired in the UK on ITV4 on Tuesdays at 7pm, starting May 4, 2010, before being moved to 1:30am on Thursdays. Friday Night Lights will be shown, starting from the beginning on Sky Atlantic HD on Tuesday February 14, 2012.In Australia, Season 4 began screening on Foxtel on December 10, 2010, and ABC2 showed Season 1 on free to air in 2011.In New Zealand, C4 broadcast the series every Friday at 8:30pm, beginning with the pilot episode on August 3, 2008. In Greece Friday Night Lights scored a 3,1% in its premiere and after 11 episode alter channel removed it from the schedule. However it was announced that the remaining episodes will return in 2010. It returned on the schedule on Fall 2010 with the first three seasons airing daily at 03:15am. In Germany, TNT Serie broadcasted FNL beginning in February 2009.In India Sony's new English entertainment channel Six has started broadcasting it.FOX TV ASIA has also started broadcasting it in the Philippines.ABC Family acquired syndication rights for the first four seasons and began airing reruns September 6, 2010,[34] but it was pulled as of October 18, 2010, due to low ratings.[35] In July 2011, it was announced that ESPN Classic has acquired the rights of all the five seasons of the show and started airing the series beginning on July 12, 2011.[36]In an attempt to bolster series ratings, NBC repositioned reruns of the show to air on its sister network Bravo during the weeks leading up to the season one finale on NBC. These episodes aired on a schedule of one hour every Friday and three hours every Saturday. Bravo is known to have an audience that is upscale and largely female, which is in line with NBC's then-President Kevin Reillys (now at FOX) new strategy for selling the show.[37] When questioned about this strategy, he admitted to regrets over initially marketing the show incorrectly saying Its been so clear to me that [the marketing for] the show ended up confusing people in terms of what [the public thought] it was supposed to be. He said that he felt the show is, at its core, a women's show and his wish is that the marketing had reflected that to a greater extent.[38]NBC has used this method of ratings-bolstering with limited success in the past, most notably during the ratings-challenged final season of The West Wing.[39]Once the 20062007 television season ended, NBC planned to air reruns throughout the summer in the hopes of gaining new viewers during the summer hiatus. Despite rising ratings for the reruns, NBC abruptly pulled them from the network's schedule on June 24, 2007. NBC resumed airing reruns in late August/early September and would be timed to the Season 1 DVD release.[40]During the 20072008 writers' strike, NBC Universal's decision to release the Season 2 DVD with only the 15 produced episodes and comments by NBC chief Ben Silverman led to speculation that the show would be canceled.[41][42]Shortly thereafter, reports began to surface that the show's producer, NBC Universal, was marketing the series to other networks including The CW Television Network, TNT, and the owner of E! and G4 about possible arrangements for a third season. Similar deals such as the one where NBC shared airing rights for Law & Order: Criminal Intent with the USA Network were a template for these discussions.Unconfirmed reports of a third-season renewal surfaced on March 5, 2008 when Nikki Finke reported on a possible cost-sharing partnership between NBC and DirecTV. The alleged agreement would have first run episodes airing exclusively on DirecTV and being airing reruns on NBC at a later date.[43] TV Guide's Michael Ausiello confirmed these reports on April 2, 2008.[44] This was later confused when USA Today ran a report that NBC has confirmed their fall line-up, including Friday Night Lights. On NBC.com, the page for the show indicates a "2009 Series Return to NBC" and "returning to NBC with new episodes next season!" that were visible in early April 2008.[45] Season three premiered exclusively on DirecTV channel 101, with the episodes replaying on NBC beginning on January 16, 2009. In March 2009, various outlets reported that DirecTV and NBC have renewed the show for two more seasons. It has been confirmed that DirecTV, in a joint venture with NBC once again, has picked up Friday Night Lights for two more 13-episode seasons. According to the official Friday Night Lights show site on NBC.com, the header reads "New Season Begins Summer 2010," which contradicts NBC's original plans to air the episodes, which would have already aired in the fall on DirecTV, mid-season, where it would have had more of a chance to obtain a sizable audience.As part of their online push for the show, NBC made the rare move of posting deleted scenes from each episode on its web site, though deleted scenes are normally held until a DVD release.[46] These scenes often provide information that is revealed later in the episode or series. An example is a scene from the episode entitled "I Think We Should Have Sex", in which it is established that the character of Walt Riggins has resumed living in the same house as his son Tim. The scene, while providing exposition on the relationship, serves only to establish a living arrangement that is made evident in subsequently aired scenes.[47]That said, the exposition given in a deleted scene can often change the intent of material that aired, such as in a deleted scene from the episode "Blinders". In the episode that aired, the character of Tim Riggins gives some prejudicial advice in regards to racial tension developing on the team. Only in the deleted scenes is it revealed that this advice was actually taken verbatim from advice his father had given to him and not necessarily what the character would have done had he not been trying to emulate his father.[48]As a show about the community of Dillon, Texas and how the high school football team affects the town as a whole, Friday Night Lights has an ensemble cast. While screen time of characters varies from episode to episode, the show is most focused on Panthers' football coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler), who strives to balance his emphasis on family, his status in a sometimes confrontational community, and his personal ambitions. His family  wife Tami Taylor (Connie Britton), a guidance counselor turned principal at Dillon High, and teenage daughter Julie Taylor (Aimee Teegarden)  are also central to the show. Coach Taylor and Tami are the only two characters to appear in every episode. When Tami becomes pregnant and gives birth to Gracie Bell Taylor (Madilyn Landry), tensions within the family increase and Julie becomes more rebellious.Outside of the Taylor family, the show focuses on the respective lives of the Dillon's high school football players. In the series' first episode, star quarterback Jason Street (Scott Porter) suffers an injury that leads to an end to his football career and a disability that he resists and then learns to cope with throughout the series. Lyla Garrity (Minka Kelly), who at the time of Jason's injury was his girlfriend, parallels his story, as she goes from a Panther cheerleader to a Christian youth leader.As a result of Jason's injury, shy and nervous Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford) becomes the Panthers' starting quarterback and eventually dates Julie. It is also revealed that Matt's father is serving in Iraq and that he must therefore care for his grandmother Lorraine Saracen (Louanne Stephens) by himself, with help only from his best friend Landry Clarke (Jesse Plemons), and eventual live-in nurse and love interest Carlotta Alonso (Daniella Alonso). Brash star running back Brian "Smash" Williams's (Gaius Charles) quest for a college football scholarship and fullback Tim Riggins's (Taylor Kitsch) tale of on-and-off alcoholism, party-life and complicated familial dynamic to brother/surrogate father, Billy Riggins (Derek Phillips), are told as well. Tyra Collette (Adrianne Palicki) also stars as a town vixen who desperately wants to leave Dillon and live a better life. Occasional girlfriend to Tim, she eventually comes to share a complicated relationship with Landry Clarke.Season one revolves around two main events: the ascension of coach Eric Taylor to the position of head coach and the paralysis of star quarterback Jason Street. These two events set off a chain reaction that leads the series through its first season.Coach Taylor's career depends on his ability to get the Dillon Panthers to the state championship. If the team suffers a losing streak, he knows his family, which includes daughter Julie, will no longer be welcome in Dillon.Meanwhile, Tami Taylor lands a job as a counselor at the local high school. Over the course of the season, she becomes a support and a mentor to many of the students and her position plays a pivotal role in the season finale, which leaves viewers wondering whether Eric will leave Dillon to accept a coveted coaching job with a university.Matt Saracen and Jason Street must struggle against seemingly insurmountable odds. Street must learn to live without the use of his legs in a town that seems to be moving on without him, while Saracen must rise to be worthy of the position he has inherited. As Street's friendship with Herc, his rehab roommate and wheelchair rugby teammate, grows stronger, so does his will and independence. The new role of QB1 is an unenviable task for the timid Matt, as he also must care for his ill grandmother while his father is fighting in Iraq. Causing further headaches, Matt falls in love with Coach Taylor's daughter, Julie, who loathes Texas life and dislikes football. She nevertheless falls for Matt because of his bumbling awkwardness and, above all, his modest decency. Their relationship slowly blossoms over the course of the season.Also explored is the pressure on the cocky, driven Brian "Smash" Williams. Easily the most promising player on the Panthers' roster, he works hard to achieve excellence and sees his future career as instrumental in providing his family a better life. Life has been hard for Williams' family since his father was killed in a car accident, and financial constraints have led his mother Corrine to take multiple jobs just to get the family by. At one point, he decides that he's willing to risk his health by using performance enhancing drugs to make sure he gets a college football scholarship.Tim Riggins is an unfocused alcoholic with absentee parents and no prospects beyond high school. However, he is shown to be a loyal friend with a good heart. Unfortunately, his good intentions seem to be repeatedly derailed by his own missteps.Tyra Collette, like many of the other characters, comes from a broken home, where her mom falls in and out of abusive relationships. Tyra begins the season as Tims girlfriend, but as Season One progresses, thanks to Tami Taylor and Landry Clark  the school math geek and Saracens best friend  she starts to see the faintest glimmer of hope that she might get out of Dillon and discontinue the cycle that her mother and her sister (a stripper) seem destined to continue.Meanwhile, Lyla goes through some of the biggest changes as she begins the season as a bubbly, optimistic, sweet-natured girl. Faced with the heartbreaking reality of Jason's injury, she begins seeing Tim Riggins to cope with her frustration. Though Jason and Lyla reconcile after he becomes aware of this, Jason begins growing closer to another woman and at the same time Lyla learns about her father's many adulterous affairs. It is at this point that Lyla moves past her dependence on other men to grow into a more independent woman.Season two begins with Coach Taylor living and working in Austin as an assistant coach at fictional TMU, while wife Tami remains in Dillon with daughter Julie and newborn baby Gracie. Tami is struggling with the demands of the new baby and with Julie's rebellious behavior. The Panthers' new coach, MacGregor, creates friction between Smash and Matt by showing blatant favoritism to Smash, drives Tim so hard he passes out during practice from dehydration and is hospitalized, alienates assistant coach Jason Street by his condescending manner, and alienates Boosters president Buddy Garrity by barring him from team practices. When Smash and Matt actually come to blows on the field and a crucial game is lost, Buddy engineers the firing of the new coach and persuades Taylor that both the team and his family are suffering in his absence. Taylor agrees to return.Julie continues to act out. She ends her romantic relationship with Matt, whom she sees as turning into a replica of her father, and pursues an older man, "the Swede," who works with her as a lifeguard at the local pool. When she finds the Swede has no interest in a serious relationship, she begins a friendship with a young teacher that her mother feels is inappropriate. Tami confronts the teacher at school, but some students overhear the conversation and spread rumors about Julie; Julie is mortified and furious at her mother.Meanwhile, Coach Taylor attempts to win games with the Panthers but faces a number of issues.Tim is kicked off the team after missing a week of practice when he leaves on the spur of the moment to go with Jason Street to Mexico to look for a treatment for Jason's paralysis. On returning to Dillon, Tim finds that a neighbor woman with whom he had a brief affair is now seeing his brother Billy and has all but moved into their house. Tim moves out but has trouble finding another place to live and ultimately returns. Coach Taylor allows him to rejoin the team after he shows up at practice and on his own initiative apologizes to everyone on the team for his lack of commitment.Lyla Garrity becomes increasingly involved in an organization for young Christians. As part of a religious outreach program she befriends a young convict, Santiago, who is released from juvenile detention shortly after they first meet. She gets him a job at her father Buddy's car dealership. Buddy encourages Santiago to try out for football after noticing his superior speed and coordination. When Taylor expresses interest in the boy, it is discovered that his only parent has left town and he has no adult in his life. Buddy agrees to take legal responsibility for him.Smash is courted by a number of college recruiters. He makes it clear his priority is a quick route to the NFL, leading to tension between him and his mother, who insists his priority should be getting an education. Smash accepts a scholarship to the prestigious TMU. However, Smash punches a white teenager who sexually harasses his sister when they're at the movies. This turns into a blown-out-of-proportion racial incident, and Smash is deemed someone to have "character issues". His scholarship to TMU is revoked. He later commits to Whitmore University, a smaller historically black college that is more highly regarded for its academics than its athletic programs. The football coach at Whitmore has a strong relationship with Coach Taylor, and had been scouting Smash since he was in middle school.Matt begins a relationship with a cheerleader before leaving her for his grandmother's new live-in nurse, Carlotta.Additionally, the early season follows an arc where Landry kills and hides the body of a man who attempted to rape Tyra, leading to a romance between the two. Eventually, guilt builds within Landry and he confesses. Charges are not pressed, although tension between him and Tyra remains.Jason Street impregnates a woman in what was supposed to be a one-night stand at the end of season two. Jason pleads with the woman to keep the child and promises to take care of the two.This season ends on a cliffhanger due to the writer's strike. The show's head writer and executive producer, Jason Katims, stated that this last episode was not in any way viewed as the season finale... If we were leading to the end of the season [under normal circumstances], we would have most likely brought the story around to the coach and his family again, and there would have been a strong football element as well, Katims said. Seven of the 22 episodes NBC ordered for Season 2 werent made.[49]The season began with Coach Taylor having failed to lead the Panthers to another State championship the year before, creating new pressure for him. Quarterback Matt Saracen's position is threatened by the arrival of freshman J.D. McCoy, an amazing natural talent who comes from a rich family with an overbearing father, Joe. Matt moves to wide receiver after Taylor names J.D McCoy the starting quarterback, but Matt is pushed back into his former role in the playoffs. He and Julie reconcile and rekindle their romance.Smash Williams, who injured his knee during the previous year's playoffs, rediscovers his love for the game, gets a tryout with Texas A&M, and succeeds in winning a spot on their team. Tyra starts dating a cowboy named Cash, leading to complications in her relationship with Landry. Tim and Lyla start dating, and Tim pursues a college football scholarship. Bill Riggins gets engaged to Tyra's older sister Mindy. He, Tim, Herc, and Jason decide to flip Buddy Garrity's house for a profit. Jason Street eventually finds a job at a sports agency in New York City and moves to the northeast to be close to his girlfriend and newborn baby. Tami Taylor becomes the principal of Dillon High School and fights with Buddy Garrity about the allocation of funds toward a Jumbotron.While Eric Taylor and Buddy Garrity were making a visit to a possible recruit who just moved into town, the coach learns of a plot to have him replaced as head coach of the Dillon Panthers. They learn that Joe McCoy wants Taylor replaced with Wade Aikman, J.D.'s personal coach. After the school's administration meets to decide who gets the coaching job, Aikman is offered the job at Dillon High School, while Taylor is offered the job of coaching the Lions of East Dillon High.Season 4 kicks off with Eric Taylor struggling as the East Dillon High coach. The team, field, and conditions are a complete change from the privileged and sparkling conditions at West Dillon.As Coach begins putting together his new Lion team, he realizes that he's in for more than he bargained for. The players that try out are less than desirable, but Coach gets a lucky break with a couple of new faces. The first is Vince Howard, a black student who has gotten in trouble with the law too many times. He is given one last chance if he plays football for the East Dillon Lions. Although he has no prior experience, he has natural talent and becomes the team's first star quarterback. The second break comes to the Lions when Buddy Garrity reveals to Eric that the address on file for the Panthers new prodigy running back, Luke Cafferty, is nothing more than a mailbox in front of an empty lot, and Luke is really zoned to go to East Dillon.The football season is one focused around growth and reestablishing a sense of Lion pride. The culmination of their hard work is tested in their last game of the season as they play The Dillon Panthers led by JD McCoy. In an amazing show of perseverance, the East Dillon Lions defeat the Dillon Panthers, ruining the Panthers' playoff chances. In season four, the character Matt Saracen struggles with staying in Dillon and living as a townie. After returning from a hunting trip with Tim Riggins, he finds out that his father was killed in Iraq. The episode "The Son" shows Matt going through the five stages of grief as he comes to accept the death of his father, a man he claims to hate. This episode garnered much buzz online and resulted in a failed campaign for Zach Gilford to get an Emmy nomination in the guest actor category; however, the episode did get an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. After this emotionally charged episode, Matt abruptly moves to Chicago without saying goodbye to his girlfriend or best friend. He returns briefly in the finale and makes amends with both Julie and Landry, who ends up flying back to Chicago with Matt.The character of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic to a young man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that the only way they can make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.Season 5, the final season, opens with summer wrapping up in Dillon: Billy Riggins joins Coach Taylor as a special teams coach for the East Dillon Lions. Tami is the new guidance counselor at East Dillon, where she is faced with the challenge of a particularly difficult student named Epyck. Landry is departing for Rice University, and Tim Riggins has three more months in jail. Becky experiences turmoil in her living situation and moves in with Billy and Mindy and develops a family of her own with them, while also developing a closer relationship with Luke. With Vince leading the Lions, along with Luke Cafferty, new recruit Hastings Ruckle, and the rest of the team standing strong behind him, Eric Taylor has strong hopes for the team to go to state. But as Vince's past comes back to haunt him, it seems that the team will have to deal with struggles off the field, as well as on. Vince's troubles also cause his relationship with Jess to take a hit. Julie's college experience is nothing like she imagined and she is forced to take a good look at what she wants. Buddy Garrity becomes a father again when Buddy Jr., who developed problems in California, is sent back to Dillon to get help from his father.Julie looks for support first from her parents, and then from her old boyfriend Matt Saracen, who is living in Chicago and attending art school. Julie drives up to spend some time with him, but leaves still confused about her future. Tim is up for parole, and with the help of Coach Taylor and Buddy Garrity, is approved for early release. Buddy gives him a job as a bartender at his bar. Tim is angry with his brother Billy and threatens to move to Alaska to work on a pipeline, but Tyra Collette comes back for a visit to Dillon and tells him he needs to repair his relationship with Billy. After they spend the night together, she asks Tim to show her his land, and the episode closes with Tyra asking, "Alaska, Tim?" to which Tim smiles a guilty smile.In the last episode, East Dillon wins the state championship after Coach Taylor and Vince share a moment of respect for each other. Coach Taylor then moves with his wife to Philadelphia as she accepts the job as Dean of Admissions at a prestigious school, and the show ends showing them living happily. Tim and Tyra talk about their dreams and a potential future at his new home site. Julie is engaged with Matt and lives with him in Chicago. Vince is the quarterback of the "Superteam" of East/West Dillon joined with Hastings, Buddy Jr., and Tinker. Jess is living in Dallas, and helping to student coach a team and is following her dreams. Billy is expecting twins with Mindy. Luke Cafferty is seen with Becky at the bus depot departing for the Army. The second to the last scene is of Tim and Billy, taking a break while putting up the frame of Tim's new house. They sit back, crack open a beer, and Billy toasts, "Texas Forever?" to which Timmy responds emphatically, "Texas Forever" and they clink their beers. The series ends with Eric coaching a new high school team in Philadelphia, (in a noticeably smaller stadium than those in Texas.) After practice, Eric recites the phrase: "Clear eyes, full hearts..." After not getting the normal response of "Can't lose," he says, "We'll deal with that later." Tami then shows up and the two walk off the field as the lights turn off.Although the series never had a high viewership, it was met with critical acclaim and has a strong fan-base. Virginia Heffernan wrote for the New York Times that "if the season is anything like the pilot, this new drama about high school football could be great  and not just television great, but great in the way of a poem or painting."[50] The Washington Post similarly praised the series as "[e]xtraordinary in just about every conceivable way."[51] Bill Simmons, a former columnist for ESPN Magazine implored readers of his column in the September 24, 2007 issue to watch the show, calling it "the greatest sports-related show ever made."[52] Positive reviews also came from USA Today,[53] the San Francisco Chronicle,[54] the Arizona Republic,[55] and the Boston Globe[56] and international sources, with The Guardian's Jonathan Bernstien calling the pilot "accomplished and engaging" and the Metro awarding it 4 out of 5 stars.[57]Throughout its inaugural season many online journalists used the frequency of their medium to heap regular praise on the show. Matt Roush of TV Guide dedicated several of his "Roush Dispatch" columns to the show calling the last episodes of season one "terrifically entertaining"[58] while Zap2it's "TVGal" asked her readers to "promise to watch [the last 4 episodes of] Friday Night Lights."[59] TV Guide's Michael Ausiello called the season one finale "predictably flawless."[60] The show's pilot did, however, receive negative reviews as well. The Philadelphia Inquirer's review was particularly harsh, calling the show a "standard high school sports soap opera." The Los Angeles Times and the Texas Monthly also were critical of the show.[61][62]Season two reviews were considerably less positive than for the first, with the Landry and Tyra murder plot being particularly panned by critics. The Los Angeles Times said that the show had lost its innocence, while the Boston Globe said the event was "out of sync with the real-life tone of the show."[63][64] Others were more positive, though, with Variety saying "faith should be shown in showrunner/writer Jason Katims" while the New York Times said "to hold 'Friday Night Lights' to a measure of realism would be to miss what are its essentially expressionistic pleasures."[65][66]Time Out New York's Andrew Johnston included the series in his list of the ten best TV shows for both 2006 and 2007, stating "Who'd have thought a tribute to heartland values would turn out to be the most avant-garde show on TV? The music and random close-ups said more than the dialogue in Peter Berg's phenomenal football drama."[67][68] Time magazine's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 Returning Series of 2007, ranking it at No. 4. In 2007, AOL TV ranked Friday Night Lights the fifth Best School Show of All Time.[69] The same year, the show placed No. 71 on Entertainment Weekly's "New TV Classics" list.[70] In 2009, Alan Sepinwall placed it in his "Best of the '00s in TV: Best Dramas" and wrote: "Few shows are as willing to so directly confront the emotions of its characters, aided by central performances  as one of TVs most realistic and loving couples  from Chandler and Connie Britton."[71]Friday Night Lights's last season was lauded by critics as it was included on numerous best lists. Poniewozik ranked it No. 7 on his list of 2011's Top 10 TV Series, saying, "The final season of this drama came down, as you would expect, to a final dramatic game. But the real action was always just as much in the stands".[72] He also ranked the final episode "Always" No. 1 on 2011's Top 10 TV Episodes list.[73] Paste Magazine also named it one of the 20 best TV shows of 2011[74] and Slant Magazine ranked Friday Night Lights No. 10 on its list of 2011's 25 Best TV Shows, concluding "The show's true concernsobsession, class, familywere articulated beautifully as ever in the quiet, familiar relationships between a town and its team, and a coach and his wife".[75] The Salt Lake Tribune in its list of the Top 10 series of 2011 ranked Friday Night Lights No. 1 explaining "For five seasons, Friday Night Lights was both the simplest and most complex show on TV. It felt like real life, and real life is complicated."[76] TV Guide named the show among its Best TV Shows of 2011 praising the fact that "Friday Night Lights left its fans with the best portrait of a marriage ever on TV".[77] It was also included on The Huffington Post's[78] and E! Online's[79] 2011's Best TV Shows.Friday Night Lights enjoys what former NBC President Kevin Reilly called a "passionate and vocal [fanbase]". This fan dedication has shown itself in everything from advertisers expressing their support for the show[80] to news outlets getting massive amounts of support mail after running positive pieces about the show.[81]It also led to the creation of several websites dedicated specifically to the show, including general information sites as well as several sites dedicated specifically to securing a second season for the show. Sites with this goal in mind included fightforlights.com,[82] which has collected positive press clippings about the show, savefridaynightlights.com[83] which has organized an online petition for its renewal, and a MySpace page,[84] which includes video, audio and text about the show.After some statements made by NBC's Entertainment head Ben Silverman about the future of the show and the fact that everything seemed to point that Friday Night Lights wouldn't be back after the writers' strike, fans put together several campaigns. Best Week Ever suggested sending lightbulbs to NBC's offices. Save FNL Campaign raised money to send footballs and contributions to charity foundations that were related to the show.[85]The Save FNL Campaign raised a total of $15,840 for 18,750 footballs, $2061 for charity, and $924 worth of DVDs for troops stationed overseas. The first shipment of 50 boxes of footballs was sent to Ben Silverman at NBC on February 28, 2009, and the second was sent to Jeff Zucker on March 3, 2009.[86]Friday Night Lights has continually been hailed as one of the Top 10 best shows of the year by critics and publications such as Time magazine, Entertainment Weekly and The New York Times. Friday Night Lights has also received a prestigious Peabody Award, three AFI awards, an Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series, an ACE Eddie Award for editing, an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing, a Television Critics Association Award, and has earned multiple Writers Guild of America nominations.The show's two leading actors, Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton, received Emmy nominations for their performances in 2010, while executive producer Jason Katims won a Humanitas Prize for writing and is nominated for a second one.In 2011, after concluding its run, the show was honored by four Emmy nominations and won the award of best actor in a drama series for Kyle Chandler and the award of best writing in a drama series for Jason Katims.[6]Though it was critically acclaimed, Friday Night Lights never enjoyed high ratings, having consistently placed below 50 in the Nielsen rankings.[87] Its first season held an average of 6.1 million viewers, while in its second season, 6.2 million. Ratings dropped in the third and fourth seasons, drawing an average of 4.58 and 3.85 million viewers respectively.According to the Media Guardian (a UK newspaper) the show's pilot, which aired on February 21, 2007, was watched by a mere 26,000 viewers in the UK. This is attributed to the program airing on ITV4, the least viewed ITV channel, and being aired opposite the first leg of the Barcelona-Liverpool tie in the first knockout round of the 200607 UEFA Champions League in soccer.[88] BSkyB began airing the shows from season one on February 14 on Sky Atlantic.On December 29, 2006 Nielsen Media Research reported the results of having, for the first time, monitored viewers who use a Digital Video Recorder to record shows for later viewing. These ratings, called "live plus seven", include all viewers who use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its initial airing.According to the Nielsen numbers, DVR viewers increased Friday Night Lights ratings by 7.5% overall in December.[89] When Nielsen monitored viewers again in April 2007 the increase went up to 17% for the week ending on April 8.[90]These numbers are up to some debate though with Medialife Magazine reporting the "live-plus-seven-day" rating for Friday Night Lights as 35 percent higher than its live rating in DVR homes.[91]On March 5, 2007 Media Life Magazine reported that Friday Night Lights was one of the most popular shows among "affluent viewers" who had little experience playing football. This was determined using a report from Magna Global who in turn used analysis done by Nielsen Media Research. Affluence in the study was determined by yearly income.In the study, Friday Night Lights tied for the 11th most watched show by affluent viewers. According to the study viewers of the show have a median household income of $65,000 per year.[92]Two soundtracks with music featured on the show were released. The first, Friday Night Lights, was released in 2007, and included music from The Killers, OutKast, and Explosions in the Sky, who had produced the score for the film. The second soundtrack, Friday Night Lights Vol. 2, was released in 2010, and included the main "Friday Night Lights Theme" by W. G. Walden. The score for both the film and television show, along with all background music and all instrumental music is performed by Explosions in the Sky.In July 2011, it was reported that Friday Night Lights creator Peter Berg was trying to pitch a second movie with the cast of the series which would pick up where the show left off, to Universal Pictures.[93] During Television Critics Association's Summer Press Tour on August 1, 2011, Berg confirmed that the script was completed and the movie is on track for a potential 2012 release.[94] Berg spoke further about the film in February 2012 when he stated that Jason Katims was "about done with the script". He said that the plot of the upcoming film was inspired by real-life college football coach Mike Leach. Berg didn't give any release dates or timing, indicating that making the film entirely depended on when the actors will be available. He went on to say that, "if we can get everyone in the same room at the same time, we all want to do it. We're not done with 'Friday Night Lights.'

It is the first spin-off of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.The pilot episode was first broadcast in United States on May 9, 2002, as an episode of CSI from the second season. The series was produced in partnership with the Canadian media company Alliance Atlantis and CBS Television Studios.On February 1, 2012, the network announced that the tenth season of CSI: Miami would be trimmed to nineteen episodes to make room for the debut of mid-season replacement NYC 22.[1] On May 13, 2012, both series were canceled.[2][3]CSI: Miami was filmed primarily in the United States. Indoor scenes were shot at Raleigh Manhattan Studios in Manhattan Beach, California. The majority of all outdoor scenes were filmed in Long Beach, California, as well as portions of Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach. Beach areas of Downtown Long Beach were often used for other outdoor scenes: Marina Green Park and Rainbow Lagoon Park. The newly constructed high-rise condos there gave the pretense of being in Miami.Many outdoor location shots were also filmed in Miami-Dade County, Florida including Coconut Grove, Coral Gables, and Miami Beach.The sculptured walkway paying tribute to the old Pike Roller Coaster can be seen in the background in the episodes "Wrecking Crew" and "Under The Influence". Footage from the Biscayne Courthouse, visible prominently in the episode "Recoil", among others, was filmed at the Water Garden Park in Santa Monica, at 34.028728, -118.471331.[4]Other locations of Long Beach are used such as the Naples district, where its canals and upscale homes with large boat docks and palm trees give a feel of Miami.The building used for exterior shots of the Miami-Dade Police Department crime lab is actually the Federal Aviation Administration Federal Credit Union headquarters located at 14600 Aviation Boulevard in Hawthorne, California.The series was canceled by CBS after the 10th season, making it the first series in the CSI franchise to be canceled.[5]Inspired by the series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami follows a South Florida team of forensic investigators/police officers who use both cutting-edge scientific methods and old-fashioned police work to solve crimes. Lieutenant Horatio Caine heads the team of investigators while working crimes in the steamy tropical surroundings and cultural crossroads of Miami. Horatio, his second in command Detective Calleigh Duquesne, and their team (Delko, Boa Vista, Wolfe, Tripp, Simmons, Donner, Speedle, Woods, Price, Salas, Loman, and Cardoza) probe cases similar to those of their Las Vegas counterparts, but Miami CSIs are cops first and scientists second.CSI: Miami has utilized an extensive cast of recurring characters on the show. Recurring characters can be found as technicians in the crime lab, as homicide detectives, as family members of main characters, and as villains, among others.CSI: Miami has been named the World's Most Popular TV Show following rating studies of 20 countries worldwide, after NCIS. The 2006 survey, which was conducted by Informa Telecoms and Media, showed that CSI: Miami was featured in more top ten viewing charts than any other show. Also, in the same survey, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation was shown to have high popularity, coming in at sixth place.[14]Like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, CSI: Miami has spawned a series of comic books, novels, and video games based on the show. In addition, the show CSI: NY spun off from a second-season episode of CSI: Miami.Seasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of CSI: Miami on CBS.ASCAP Award:ASC Award:Emmy:BMI Film & TV Awards:'California on Location Awards:Image Awards:Motion Picture Sound Editors:People's Choice Awards:ACS Awards:ALMA Awards:Emmy:Image Awards:Imagen Foundation Awards:Motion Picture Sound Editors:Young Artist Awards:* The Region 4 releases of the first two seasons were initially divided up into two parts of 11 or 12 episodes before being released in full season DVD "fat packs", with large cases compared to the slimline cases DVD distributors opt for now.

The first of the series to be published was CSI: Miami. The game features actual cast members such as Horatio Caine, Alexx Woods and Calleigh Duquesne who are trying to solve a murder in South Beach with the player's assistance.[31] The game is also available for download on various iPod devices.[32]In 2008[when?], Gameloft and CBS released CSI: Crime Scene Investigation  The Mobile Game which is based on the original series in Las Vegas, NV.

Horatio is known to be very protective of his team, often going out of his way to assist them when needed. He is an outstanding marksman, and does not hesitate to use deadly force. He also very often goes to extraordinary lengths to save evidence or a potential victim. His demeanor is serious, direct, and to the point. Horatio appears to have a good sense for how to communicate with children who have just experienced traumatic ordeals. Horatio uses the "stay-calm" approach while comforting victims, killers, etc. Horatio is usually seen wearing a pair of sunglasses. Horatio was briefly married to Marisol Delko Caine (Alana de la Garza); the marriage ended when she was murdered by a Mala Noche sniper in "Rampage". In "Dangerous Son", Horatio discovered that he has a sixteen-year-old son named Kyle Harmon (Evan Ellingson). "John Walden" is a cover name he used sixteen years earlier doing undercover special task force work in Pensacola, FL where Horatio met Julia (Elizabeth Berkley) (Kyle's mother). The episode "In The Wind" revealed that Kyle is in Afghanistan. In "Going Ballistic", Caine is apparently shot, but it is later revealed in the episode, "Resurrection", that he faked his death in order to stop a sale of illegal bullets. His formation of the team in 1997 is depicted in flashbacks in the episode "Out of Time", shortly after he became the head of the new investigative unit swiftly renamed CSI.CSI Level 3 Day Shift Assistant Supervisor: Detective Calleigh Duquesne (Emily Procter) is a ballistics specialist. Calleigh's slight build, blonde good looks, and southern belle accent often lead others to underestimate her, but she is a brilliant and a dedicated scientist. Her father is an alcoholic attorney who has tried to rehabilitate himself several times. She follows the letter of the rules at all times. In "Ambush", a website seems to be stalking her and it is later discovered that the person behind it is Dan Cooper whom she was involved in catching for stealing deceased CSI Tim Speedle's credit card. In "All In", she is kidnapped and forced to help cover up a crime scene, but is later saved by her fellow CSIs. In "Smoke Gets in Your CSI's", Calleigh was rushed to the hospital for smoke inhalation when she and Ryan Wolfe escaped from a burning house with a dead body. In "Seeing Red", Calleigh shot Eric Delko, and in "Out of Time", Eric is in critical condition and a flashback occurs back to 1997 and Calleigh's first day on the job. As of seasons 7 and 8, she is in a romantic relationship with Eric Delko.CSI Level 3: Detective Ryan Wolfe (Jonathan Togo) was working as a police officer at the time he was hired for the lab virtually on the spot by Horatio Caine, who noted Ryan's immaculate care of his gun with approval, likely due to Wolfe having OCD. He first appeared in "Under the Influence" but did not become a regular cast member until "Hell Night". Ryan was replacing fallen CSI Tim Speedle, who died in the line of duty as a direct result of his poor gun maintenance. Ryan was impaled in the eye with a nail gun in "Nailed". At the end of the episode "Burned", Ryan was fired for being directly linked to a murder suspect and not disclosing it to the department. Seeking jobs as both a crime-scene expert, an expert witness for the defense, a firearms range technician, and applying to work as an ME Investigator while applying for reinstatement, he was later reinstated. In "Going Ballistic", Ryan receives a text message saying, "It is done," right after Horatio is shot and presumed dead. It is revealed in the seventh season premiere that he was asked by Horatio to assist in setting up Horatio's own execution, so he could go undercover. At the end of "Target Specific" and throughout the episode "Wolfe In Sheep's Clothing", Ryan was kidnapped and was forced by the Russian mob to cover up a crime.MDPD Homicide Detective: Sergeant Frank Tripp (Rex Linn) is a Texas-born homicide detective who accompanies the team to the crime scenes. He is known for interrogating suspects in his typical sarcastic manner and has a good working relationship with all the CSIs. He is divorced with three kids, revealed in "Dispo Day". After passing the Sergeant's Exam in the beginning of "Dangerous Son", Tripp was required to spend some time in uniform on a patrol rotation, but soon returned to the homicide unit and plainclothes in "Guerillas in the Mist". He often accompanies the CSIs to the crime scene to lend a hand and provide extra cover.CSI Level 2: Officer Natalia Boa Vista (Eva LaRue) is a DNA analyst who upon first arriving, was only allowed to work on cold or unsolved cases due to the restrictions of her federal grant. She escaped an abusive marriage before joining the department, when her association with a society for battered women was key to helping the team solve the murder of a woman. At the end of season four, it is revealed that Natalia is an FBI informant in the lab, assigned to help build a case against Horatio Caine and his team. Natalia was revealed to be the mole in the lab. In season 5, much to her distress, she discovered her abusive ex-husband Nick Townsend (Rob Estes) was out of prison when he served her with a restraining order and he was working for a private company that cleans up crime scenes. The two shared a tense relationship until Nick's murder, a crime for which Natalia was briefly considered the prime suspect. In "Darkroom", Ryan Wolfe finds a stash of photographed girls and Natalia discovers that one of the pictures is her sister Anya and DNA from a crime scene reveals that Anya is indeed one of the women that the CSIs are looking for. In "Tunnel Vision", Natalia was finally certified to carry a firearm, and she shot a suspect in self-defense with her Glock 26 for the first time. In "Count Me Out", Natalia was involved in a meth lab explosion that caused hearing loss.CSI Level 1: Officer Walter Simmons (Omar Benson Miller) a Louisiana native and art theft specialist who transfers over from the night shift to join Horatio's team. His first appearance was in episode, "Bolt Action". He became part of the main cast in episode, "Dude, Where's My Groom?"CSI Level 3: Detective Eric Delko (Adam Rodrguez) is the fingerprint and drug identification expert of Cuban and Russian descent. He is also the team's underwater recovery expert. In "Shattered", Delko's job is endangered when he is arrested for drug possession, but it is discovered that the marijuana was for his sister, Marisol Delko Caine (Alana de la Garza), to ease the pain of her leukemia treatments, who was murdered by a Mala Noche sniper after she married Horatio Caine. In "Man Down", while trying to rescue a woman kidnapped by escapee Clavo Cruz (Gonzalo Menendez), Delko was shot in the head by one of his henchmen and critically wounded. He survived and went back on the team, but suffered some memory loss. In "And How Does That Make You Kill?", Eric told his psychiatrist of his affection for CSI Calleigh Duquesne. In "The DeLuca Motel", it is discovered that he has been staying in a motel because someone is following him. They found out that his real father is from Cuba and is trying to kill him. In "Seeing Red", Eric was trying to help his father and is seen escaping a gun silo, only to be shot at by friend Calleigh. He survives and is shown waking up in a hospital room in "Out of Time". Actor Adam Rodrguez did not return full-time for the eighth season and was replaced by former CSI Jesse Cardoza (Eddie Cibrian). Delko shows that he is leaving by telling Calleigh that he is going to leave the CSI team because life is too short.[6] On February 19, 2010, Adam Rodrguez announced on his Twitter page that he will be returning to the show as a regular.[7][8] As of season 7 and season 8, he is in a romantic relationship with Calleigh Duquesne.CSI Level 3 Day Shift Assistant Supervisor: Lieutenant Megan Donner (Kim Delaney) was Horatio's predecessor who went on indefinite leave from her job following the death of her husband.[9] She briefly returned to work alongside Horatio, who had since been promoted to head investigator of the CSI unit, but later resigned, finding the pressure of the job to now be more than she could handle. Some of this information appeared to be retconned early in the show's eighth season in an episode that featured flashbacks to the case that prompted the creation of the CSI squad; in the newly-established canon, Donner (who was mentioned but not seen in the episode) still worked at the lab, but the squad was headed by Horatio from its inception. Actress Kim Delaney's character was reportedly written out due to the lack of chemistry between her and Caruso.[10]CSI Level 3: Detective Timothy (Tim) Speedle (Speed) (Rory Cochrane) was a trace evidence and impressions expert; originally from Syracuse, New York, who worked for the St. Petersburg PD in 1997, and had a degree in biology from Columbia University. Speed was killed in the line of duty in, "Lost Son;" he had not maintained his firearm diligently and was shot by a suspect when it misfired during a shoot-out. The character was written out at the request of actor Rory Cochrane, who wanted to pursue a career in film and reportedly disliked the long, arduous shooting schedules for CSI: Miami.[11] The actor later reprised his role as a hallucination of Eric Delko in "Bang, Bang, Your Debt". It was revealed in "Out of Time", that Jesse Cardoza knew Tim Speedle, who was working for the St. Petersburg PD in 1997, and Cardoza asked Horatio if he wanted him to be part of his new team.MDPD Homicide Detective: Detective Yelina Salas (Sofia Milos) was a Colombian homicide detective frequently attached to CSI investigations, and the widow of Horatio's brother Raymond Caine. She later starts a relationship with IAB Sergeant Rick Stetler, Horatio's personal nemesis. After her husband Raymond was revealed to still be alive, she left with him and their son for Brazil, where they planned to keep a low profile for Ray's safety. She reappears in the fifth season premiere, "Rio". Horatio and Eric fly to Rio de Janeiro to hunt down Antonio Riaz, who murdered Horatio's wife and Delko's sister Marisol. While in Rio, Riaz kills Raymond Caine and is enlisting Ray Jr. into drug running in the shantytowns of the area. Yelina and Ray Jr. wind up back in Miami, and Yelina goes into business as a private investigator revealed in "Burned". In "Dangerous Son", Yelina investigates a suspect for Horatio, and she locates a birth certificate that reveals that the parolee is in fact Horatio's biological son. Yelina also returns for the seventh season premiere, going undercover to help Horatio capture enemy Ron Saris. She was kidnapped in the episode "Seeing Red", but was rescued by Horatio.Medical Examiner: Dr. Alexx Woods (Khandi Alexander) was a Miami-Dade medical examiner. Alexx began her medical career in New York as a physician and became a medical examiner with the CSI team after moving to Miami for personal reasons. She is a very emotional person, and is more of a "mother" figure for the CSI team, showing great concern for them. She also often talks to the dead bodies in a comforting and caring tone as she examines them. She is married with a son and daughter. In "Rock and A Hard Place", her son is named the prime suspect in a murder; this causes Alexx to rethink her job in the M.E.'s Office (and her place on the team as well as her friendship with the other CSI's), and she quits, saying to Horatio, "I need to spend more of my time taking care of the living." Horatio responds by saying that should she wish to return, her post would be open for her. Alexx returned in "Smoke Gets in Your CSI's" as a part-time ER doctor at Dade General.Medical Examiner: Dr. Tara Price (Megalyn Echikunwoke) was the day-shift medical examiner who replaced Dr. Alexx Woods (Khandi Alexander) in the seventh season. She made her debut in "Won't Get Fueled Again" and became part of the main cast credits in "Bombshell". In "Cheating Death", CSIs Eric Delko and Ryan Wolfe play a joke on her that almost results in the entire case being compromised. In the end of "Divorce Party", Tara is shown to steal a bottle of Oxycodone (an opioid analgesic medication) from a victim in the morgue and blames it on Julia Winston. Also, Horatio Caine has his son Kyle working as an intern for her after he gets into trouble. In "Dissolved", Ryan Wolfe confronts Tara about the stolen pills in her locker. When Julia takes the autopsy hostage because of what she did, Tara is arrested. Actress Megalyn Echikunwoke's image was removed from the main cast credits after "Dissolved".CSI Level 2: Officer Jesse Cardoza (Eddie Cibrian) was a former LAPD officer, who transferred back to the MDPD. In "Out of Time", a flashback occurs back to 1997, depicting Cardoza's departure from the Miami crime lab and transfer to Los Angeles, following in the conclusion of a case that led to Horatio Caine becoming head of the new investigative unit that became CSI. He returns in "Hostile Takeover", as a member of the team, taking Eric Delko's place. When he returns, the lab is attacked and he is taken hostage along with three other people, but he was rescued by Horatio. After that, in the episode "Show Stopper", there was a discrepancy in the department's Hummer mileage log; Jesse did not explain it at first, but later on, in the lockerroom, he explained to Calleigh that he was following a woman and who was in danger from a man he'd dealt with in California, and that he'd transferred back to Miami because the man in question had also killed Cardoza's wife. In June 2010 it was announced that Cibrian was not picked up as a regular for the ninth season and his character would be leaving.[12] It was revealed in the ninth season premiere that he died after being poisoned by halon gas in the eighth season finale, having suffered head trauma in the fall."Cross Jurisdictions": CSI: Miami was spun off from this episode of the original CSI (CSI: Crime Scene Investigation) TV series.

"South Beach Riot". New York Sun Newspaper. http://www.nysun.com/pf.php?id=48049.CSI on the CSI WikiHeroes is an American science fiction television drama series created by Tim Kring that appeared on NBC for four seasons from September 25, 2006 through February 8, 2010. The series tells the stories of ordinary people who discover superhuman abilities, and how these abilities take effect in the characters' lives. The series emulates the aesthetic style and storytelling of American comic books, using multi-episode story arcs that build upon a larger, more encompassing arc.[1] The series was produced by Tailwind Productions in association with Universal Media Studios.[2] It was filmed primarily in Los Angeles, California.[3]Four complete seasons aired, ending on February 8, 2010. The critically acclaimed first season had a run of 23 episodes and garnered an average of 14.3 million viewers in the United States, receiving the highest rating for an NBC drama premiere in five years.[4] The second season of Heroes attracted an average of 13.1 million viewers in the U.S.,[5] and marked NBC's sole series among the top 20 ranked programs in total viewership for the 20072008 season.[6] Heroes has garnered a number of awards and nominations, including Primetime Emmy Awards, Golden Globes, People's Choice Awards and British Academy Television Awards.[2]An online extension of the series, Heroes 360 Experience, later rebranded as Heroes Evolutions, was created to explore the Heroes universe and provides insight into the show's mythology.[7] Other official Heroes media include magazines, action figures, tie-in and interactive websites, a mobile game, a novel, clothing and other merchandise. In the fall of 2008, NBC Digital Entertainment released a series of online content for the summer, including more original web content, wireless iTV interactivity, graphic novels available for mobile viewing and webisodes.[8]NBC announced Heroes' cancellation on May 14, 2010.[9][10] Afterward, the network considered making a television special event to conclude the series;[11][12] however, on September 9, 2010, NBC announced the decision to stop any further development of the Heroes franchise. Tim Kring then suggested that the broad premise of Heroes' storylines allowed for the franchise to return for fans, but he did not specify when or in what media format.[13]Originally, Kring designed the series to have an ever-shifting cast. However, his motivation changed when he realized how popular the original cast was with audiences; therefore, he brought back most of the first season cast for the second season, with a few additions who received star billing.[14] In its first season, the show features an ensemble cast of twelve main characters making it the third largest cast in American primetime television behind Desperate Housewives and Lost. Although NBC's first season cast page listed only ten characters,[15] Leonard Roberts, who first appeared in the series' fifth episode as D. L. Hawkins, was an additional member of the original full-time cast.[16] In episode eleven of the first season, Jack Coleman, who portrays Noah Bennet, was upgraded from a recurring role to become the twelfth full-time cast member.[17]The first season featured 12 series regulars. Hayden Panettiere portrays high school cheerleader Claire Bennet who can spontaneously regenerate. Jack Coleman plays her father Noah Bennet, an agent for The Company. Santiago Cabrera played the troubled addict Isaac Mendez who can paint the future. Tawny Cypress portrays Simone Deveaux, an art dealer and skeptic. Greg Grunberg plays LAPD police officer Matt Parkman, who can read people's minds. Ali Larter plays Niki Sanders, an internet stripper with a severe dissociative disorder and super strength. Leonard Roberts plays Niki's husband D. L. Hawkins, an ex-convict who can pass through solid matter. Noah Gray-Cabey plays Micah Sanders, Niki and D. L.'s young son who can communicate with and control digital technology. Masi Oka portrays space-time manipulator Hiro Nakamura. Adrian Pasdar plays Nathan Petrelli, a congressional candidate with the ability to fly. Sendhil Ramamurthy plays geneticist Mohinder Suresh. Milo Ventimiglia portrays hospice nurse Peter Petrelli, with the ability to mimic abilities of other posthumans.During the first two seasons, some characters were written out to make room for new characters with new stories. Simone was the first major character to be written out, dying near the end of season one. DL became a guest star after the events of the first season's finale, making two appearances throughout season two. Isaac Mendez was also written out, dying at the hands of Sylar, which was shown during Hiro Nakamura's time traveling expedition to New York earlier in season one. New characters added during season two include: Maya Herrera, played by Dania Ramirez, a fugitive with the ability to emit a deadly poison; Adam Monroe, a 400-year-old Englishman and legendary warrior Takezo Kensei with the ability to regenerate, portrayed by David Anders; Monica Dawson, portrayed by Dana Davis, a restaurant worker with the ability to mimic physical movements she sees; Elle Bishop, a sadistic sociopath with the ability to generate electricity portrayed by Kristen Bell. Two recurring characters from season one, Sylar, portrayed by Zachary Quinto, and Ando Masahashi, portrayed by James Kyson Lee, were upgraded to main characters in season two.Starting in season three, recurring character Angela Petrelli, portrayed by Cristine Rose, was promoted to a main character.[18] Elle, Adam and Micah were removed from the main cast. Monica Dawson did not appear after scenes including her were cut. Niki was also written out but actress Ali Larter remained on the show portraying a new character Tracy Strauss, Niki's triplet sister with the power to freeze objects with a touch.[19] For season four, a new character Samuel, portrayed by Robert Knepper, was added. Originally cast as a recurring part, the part was changed to a starring role.[20] Deanne Bray was also added as Emma Coolidge, the deaf woman who had enhanced synesthesia (seeing colors for music) including the ability to create a siren song.The plot of Heroes is designed to be told in a way similar to the way comic books are told. Each season of Heroes contains one or two "volumes". There are several main story lines in each volume. As the main plots develop, smaller, more intimate stories are told within them. Each main character's story is developed separately and as time passes their paths cross and it is explained how their stories are intertwined and connected. This is the story of ordinary people who discover extraordinary super powers after a solar eclipse reveals them, and how these abilities affect the characters' daily lives.The first season, known as "Volume One: Genesis", begins with a seemingly ordinary group of people who gradually become aware that they have special abilities. The story develops showing their reactions to these powers, and how this discovery affects their personal and professional lives. At the same time, several ordinary individuals are investigating the origins and extent of these abilities. Mohinder Suresh (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a research geneticist, continues his late father's research into the biological source of the powers, while Noah Bennet (Jack Coleman) represents, and is a lead agent for, a secret organization known only as "the Company" that wants to control and, if necessary, terminate those who are gifted. After only having a short time to come to terms with their new abilities, each of the heroes is drawn into the final showdown. They must each do their part to stop the destruction of the world that starts with an impending explosion at Kirby Plaza in New York City.Season two, known as "Volume Two: Generations",[21] begins four months after the events at Kirby Plaza. The main plot of Generations deals with the Company and its research on the Shanti virus. In a flashback to 1977, the research is performed by the Company's founders, whose identities are eventually revealed, to discover what the effects of various strains of the virus will do the human and superhuman population. The virus is weaponized and locked away at Primatech Paper, the Company's facility used as a front. Returning to the present, the heroes must come together in an attempt to stop the release of a deadly strain of the virus and avert a global pandemic.The first part of season three is called "Volume Three: Villains". Volume three begins with an assassination attempt on Nathan Petrelli (Adrian Pasdar), a political figure who can fly, and explores its consequences. Meanwhile, several villains escape from the confines of Level 5, a maximum security area owned and operated by the Company within Primatech, and Noah Bennet attempts to recapture them. Arthur Petrelli (Robert Forster), Nathan Petrelli's father, heals from systemic nerve damage and aims to create a formula to give ordinary people superhuman abilities. The second part of season three, "Volume Four: Fugitives", reveals what happens after Nathan fails to produce the formula. After the destruction of Primatech and Pinehearst, the rival company of Primatech, the heroes attempt to lead normal lives until Nathan initiates his plan to round up all people with abilities. Sylar kills Nathan in an intense duel. However, because Nathan is a prominent political player, Matt Parkman (Greg Grunberg), who has power over people's minds, is instructed to alter Sylar's mind so that he will believe that he is Nathan and take his place. This has a negative side effect causing Sylar's consciousness to become trapped in Matt Parkman's mind.Season four contains volume five, "Redemption", and takes place six weeks after the events of season three. The heroes try to return to their normal lives; Peter returns to his job as a paramedic, while Claire attends college. Sylar's body is causing his previously acquired abilities to manifest as he struggles with his forced identity as Nathan. Sylar's actual consciousness, trapped in Matt Parkman's mind, taunts Matt and seeks out his own body. Meanwhile, Hiro has to deal with his brain tumor that is slowly killing him and preventing him from controlling his powers. A carnival group is introduced whose leader, Samuel, tries to recruit more people with abilities into his carnival family. Samuel claims he is creating a community for special people where they are welcome to be open with their abilities and respected by outsiders. In truth, he is bringing together as many people with abilities as possible to build up his own power, moving earth. The more special people he has around him, the stronger his power is. The heroes have to come together to battle Samuel and his plan to expose "specials" to the world by killing thousands of people. The series finale ends by opening the nonexistent volume six, "Brave New World", in which Claire reveals the existence of people with special abilities to a group of reporters and photographers.Heroes began development early in 2006, when Tim Kring, creator of NBC's Crossing Jordan, came up with the show's concept. Kring wanted to create a "large ensemble saga" that would connect with the audience. He began thinking about how big, scary and complicated he felt the world is, and wanted to create a character-driven series about people who could do something about it. Kring felt that a cop or medical drama did not have characters that were big enough to save the world. He came up with the thought of superheroes; ordinary people who would discover extraordinary abilities, while still rooted in the real world and in reality. Casting directors Jason La Padura and Natalie Hart brought forth a cast of new faces such as Milo Ventimiglia who described the pilot as a "character drama about everyday people with a heightened reality." Said heightened reality was brought to light through the work of production designer Ruth Ammon. Kring wanted the series to have touchstones that involved the characters and the world they lived in.[22][23]Before he began putting his ideas together, he spoke with Lost executive producer Damon Lindelof, with whom he had worked for three years on Crossing Jordan. Kring credits Lindelof for giving him ideas on how to pitch the series to the network and advice on the lessons he (Lindelof) learned about working on a serialized drama. The two still speak and support each other's projects.[24][25][26] When Kring pitched the idea for Heroes to the NBC network, he described the network's reaction as "excited...very supportive."[27] He comments that he has been partners with NBC for some time based on his six year run as showrunner for Crossing Jordan.[27] When he pitched the pilot, he described every detail, including the cliffhanger ending. When NBC executives asked him what was going to happen next, Kring responded, "Well, you'll just have to wait and find out."[28] After the project was greenlit, a special 73-minute version of the pilot was first screened to a large audience at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International.[29] It was initially reported that this unaired pilot would not be released, but it was included on the season one DVD set.[30]When the writing team worked on an episode, each writer took a character and wrote the individual scenes surrounding them. These stories were then combined and given to the episode writer. This system allowed every writer to contribute to every episode,[31] and enabled the writing team to finish scripts sooner, so the filming crew could shoot more scenes at a location.[28] Tim Kring described the writing process as a collaborative one and stated that the collaboration process was important because production needed to shoot several scenes at a single location. To do this, several scripts had to be ready. Jesse Alexander, co-producer and writer, explained that this process was important in a serialized drama because one has to know where each character's development is heading.[28]Season two coincided with the WGA writers' strike, meaning only 11 out of the planned 24 episodes were produced.[32] This forced the producers to redesign the season to encompass only the Generations volume out of the three planned.[33] The planned third volume, Exodus,[34] which was originally designed to be a story arc reflecting the effects of the release of strain 138 of the Shanti virus, was canceled. The planned fourth volume, Villains, was changed to the third volume and moved into season three.[5] Scenes from the volume two finale, "Powerless", were reshot to reflect the cancellation of the Exodus volume, and to tie up all the loose plot storylines of Generations.[35][36]Following criticisms of the second and third volumes, Tim Molloy from TV Guide reported that Heroes would return to its roots with the fourth volume, Fugitives, to attract new viewers and regain those who gave up on the show because of too many characters and plotlines.[37] In November 2008, NBC fired Jesse Alexander and Jeph Loeb from the production staff of Heroes over creative differences and budget problems.[38] As a result, Tim Kring would refocus the series on character development and simple storytelling.[39] However, a high-ranking insider told TV Guide that rather than pressure from NBC or Universal Media responding to recent plummeting ratings, it was Kring himself who fired Alexander and Loeb because the duo refused to continue character-driven stories that made the first season popular from the start.[40] In December 2008, Bryan Fuller signed a 2-year deal with Universal Media Studios after the cancellation of his ABC series Pushing Daisies.[41] He rejoined the writing staff of Heroes starting with the 20th episode of season three and had a "key role in the writing and direction" of the series.[42] However, on June 22 it was revealed that Fuller left Heroes to work on other projects.[43] On April 28, 2009, director/producer Greg Beeman was fired by NBC.[44]The series score is composed by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, with music engineer Michael Perfitt[45] and vocals provided by Shankar. Each episode averages thirty to thirty-five minutes of music. Melvoin and Coleman became involved with Heroes from their previous work with executive producer Allan Arkush.[46] Tim Kring gave general instructions to the pair, including the emotion and direction for each character. Kring wanted incredibly unusual music and gave Melvoin and Coleman a lot of freedom and permission to experiment.[citation needed] In the pilot episode, Kring suggested that a "dreamy" cue be used in the scene involving Claire Bennet running into a burning train. The "dreamy" cue has since become a signature piece of the show. Melvoin and Coleman developed musical cues for each character. Claude's theme involved wind and voices to create the feeling of a ghost-like presence. Sylar's involves marimbas and bassoons with staccato to re-create the sound of clocks ticking in reference to the character's power. Matt Parkman's theme involves voices being played backwards when he uses his power of telepathy. Peter Petrelli's theme involves marcato strings. Niki Sanders's theme was based on her character's alter-ego named Jessica and involved winds and Indian voices chanting in an underscore to give a feeling that she was possessed. Mohinder Suresh's theme is the piano composition that plays at the end of some episodes.[46]In 2007, the ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards gave Melvoin and Coleman the "Top Television Series" award for their work on Heroes.[47] In France, the theme music of Heroes is composed by Victoria Petrosillo.[48] Her song, "Le Hros d'un autre", is used by television network TF1 to replace the show's original incidental music. The network created a new opening credit sequence so they could play Petrosillo's theme song.[49] The official Heroes soundtrack was released on March 18, 2008 by The NBCUniversal Television, DVD, Music & Consumer Products Group. On February 29, 2008 the Group released five music videos created by Heroes producer/director Allan Arkush, each combining show footage with songs from the soundtrack.[50][51][52] In September 2008, Melvoin and Coleman announced that they would be releasing an album consisting entirely of the score from Heroes, entitled Heroes: Original Score.[53] It was released on April 14, 2009 by La-La Land Records.[54]Eric Grenaudier and John Han of Stargate Digital are the visual effects supervisors and Mark Spatny[55] is the visual effects producer for Heroes. They work with visual effects animators Anthony Ocampo and Ryan Wieber, who are also from Stargate.[22][56] The series visual effects consist of blue screens and 2D and 3D animation. The visual effects for the series are created after the scene is shot in post-production, unlike special effects, which are incorporated into the scenes during filming.[57] Notable visual effects include radioactive Ted in "Company Man", Nathan flying from Mr. Bennet and The Haitian in "Hiros", and Hiro's time freezing encounter with the schoolgirl in the red bow in "One Giant Leap".[22] The special effects are coordinated by Gary D'Amico. Stunts are coordinated by Ian Ouinn, who also uses blue screens to accomplish some of the stunts in the series, such as Nathan Petrelli flying away from Heidi during the car accident scene in "Six Months Ago". Principal filming for Heroes takes place in Los Angeles and Santa Clarita, California.[3] The Stargate Digital team are also responsible for making Los Angeles look like international locations, such as India and Ukraine, using blue screens and set designs by Ruth Ammon, production designer for the series.[58] The series is filmed using a single-camera setup.In keeping with the comic book thematic elements used on Heroes, professional comic book artists Tim Sale and Alex Maleev were brought in to provide the artwork used within the series under the direction of Ruth Ammon, including the artwork of Isaac Mendez, and Mendez metafictional comic book series, the 9th Wonders!.[59] Additionally, the font used in captions and credits for the show is reminiscent of traditional hand-rendered comic book lettering. It was created by Sale and is based on his handwriting style.[60] Heroes is designed by production designer Ruth Ammon. Ammon has been nominated for her work on Heroes twice by the Art Directors Guild and has also been nominated for two Emmy Awards for excellence in art direction.On May 14, 2007, NBC announced that it would air a six-episode Heroes spin-off called Heroes: Origins during the 20072008 season.[61] The show was to introduce a new character each week, and viewers were to select which one would stay for the following season of the regular series.[62] The show was supposed to air after the completion of the second season of Heroes in April 2008;[61] however, on October 31, 2007, it was reported that Origins had been postponed because of the Writers Guild of America strike.[63] Tim Kring stated in an interview that the first episode of Origins was to reveal the secrets and meanings behind the Helix symbol. However, because of the WGA Strike, Kring commented that the secret will have to be revealed down the line. Kring revealed that he was to write the first episode of Origins, and that John August had been hired to write another episode.[64] Director Kevin Smith, a fan of Heroes, was set to write and direct an episode for the spin-off,[65] as were Eli Roth and Michael Dougherty.[66] On April 3, 2008, a day after NBC announced its 20082009 primetime schedule, Ben Silverman confirmed Origins's cancellation.[67]Heroes includes some mysterious fictional recurring elements that have been ascribed to science fiction or supernatural phenomena. Tim Kring and the creators of the series refer to these fictional elements as part of the mythology of the series. Kring confirmed that although the show has a unique mythology, he does not want to sink too deeply into it. Rather, Kring has used volumes to wrap up ongoing plot lines instead of carrying storylines over long periods of time as in Lost.[68] Among the show's mythological elements are the Company, the legend of Takezo Kensei, paintings of the future, superpowers and their origins, the Shanti virus, 9th Wonders! comic book, and numerous other elements and mythological themes.During the series' first season, the American Film Institute named Heroes one of the ten "best television programs of the year."[69] Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, "the show's super strengths are its well-developed filmmaking, smooth pacing and a perfect cast. It views like the first hour of a fun, thoughtful movie." Barry Garron at The Hollywood Reporter also stated, "Heroes is one of TV's most imaginative creations and might, with luck, become this year's Lost."[70] Less favorable reviews included the Philadelphia Inquirer, who commented that although the show had lots of "cool effects," it "lands, splat, in a pile of nonsense and dim dialogue." In response to the first pod of season one episodes, The Chicago Tribune went as far as saying, "you could watch the first few episodes of Heroes, or you could repeatedly hit yourself on the head with a brick. The effect is surprisingly similar."[71] At Metacritic, the Heroes pilot received a 67/100, with generally favorable reviews from critics.[72] The show was declared the fourth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (20022012).[73]Season two was criticized by commentators and fans for a much slower pace, less engaging storyline and lack of focus compared to the first season. Milo Ventimiglia stated that "when there's a little bit of a delay, there's not that instant, rewarding scene or moment or episode... people get impatient, so it has been extremely important for them to strike a balance between giving and getting."[74] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Heroes creator Tim Kring commented on criticisms of season two, and the series' 15% decline in ratings.[75] Kring said that he felt he had made mistakes with the direction of season two. He had thought that the audience was looking for a "build-up of characters and the discovery of their powers", when viewers were instead looking for "adrenaline." Kring also outlined what he felt were problems with plot development, stating that season two "took too long to get to the big-picture story", explaining that Peter's vision of the viral armageddon should have occurred in the first episode instead of the seventh. He feels that it would have been better to introduce new characters within the context of the main storyline, as with Elle, rather than in unattached arcs such as that of Maya and Alejandro. Kring also admitted that he should have resolved the "Hiro in Japan" storyline much more quickly, and that the romantic stories are not working well. With regard to Claire and West, and Hiro and Yaeko, he said, "I've seen more convincing romances on TV. In retrospect, I don't think romance is a natural fit for us."[75]Season three had harsh reception. Los Angeles Times said "Even just a half hour in, it's difficult not to wish everyone would just lighten the heck up. The graphic novel noir feel is becoming increasingly oppressive, and everyone is just so grim."[76] New York Post said "This show, which was once so thrilling and fun, has become full of itself, its characters spouting crazy nonsense."[76]By the time Heroes completed the first half of the first season, the show had already collected an assortment of honors and accolades. On December 13, 2006, the Writers Guild of America nominated the program for "best new series" of 2007.[77] On December 14, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association nominated the program for a Golden Globe Award for "best television drama", and nominated Masi Oka (Hiro Nakamura) for Best Supporting Actor on a TV Series.[78] On January 9, 2007, Heroes won the award for Favorite New TV Drama at the 33rd People's Choice Awards.[79] The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People nominated Heroes on January 9, 2007 for an Image Award in the "Outstanding Drama Series" category.[80] On February 21, 2007, it was announced that Heroes was nominated for five Saturn Awards. The nominations included "Best Network Television Series", "Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series" for both Greg Grunberg and Masi Oka, and "Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series" for Hayden Panettiere and Ali Larter.[81] On February 22, 2008, it was announced that Heroes was again nominated for five Saturn Awards. The nominations for 2008 include "Best Network Television Series," "Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series" for both Greg Grunberg and Masi Oka, "Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series" for Hayden Panettiere, and "Best Television Series on DVD." The 2008 nominations are similar to the 2007 nominations, except Ali Larter was not nominated this year; instead the Heroes Season one DVD was nominated, in a different category.[81]On July 19, 2007, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced their nominations for the 2007 Primetime Emmy Awards. Heroes was nominated in eight categories, including Outstanding Drama Series. The first episode, "Genesis", earned six nominations: Outstanding Directing (David Semel), Outstanding Art Direction for a Single-Camera Series, Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series, Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series, and Outstanding Stunt Coordination. The episode "Five Years Gone" also received a nomination for Outstanding Visual Effects for a Series. Masi Oka was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.[82] On September 16, 2007, the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards were held and Heroes failed to win a single Emmy award despite the eight nominations. On July 21, 2007, the Television Critics Association awarded Heroes with the prestigious Outstanding Program of the Year title during their 23rd Annual TCA Awards ceremony.[83] The cast of Heroes was named in the 2006 Time Magazine's Person of the Year issue under "People Who Mattered".[84]The pilot episode generated 14.3 million viewers,[85] with the season high topping out at 16.03 million viewers for episode 9.[86] When the series returned from hiatus on January 22, 2007, the ratings averaged about the same as the pilot with 14.9 million viewers.[87] When the show went on a second hiatus during the first season, from March 4, 2007 to April 23, 2007 (7 weeks), ratings hit a new low; the lowest being 11.14 million viewers during part one of the three part finale, "The Hard Part."[88] In season two, the opener was consistent in the ratings, however, week-by-week, the ratings continued to dive, reaching another new low for the series on episode seven, "Out of Time", with only 9.87 million viewers. Although the ratings were lower than average, this episode was considered to be a turning point for the declining season, as a major plot twist was introduced and the volume's "big picture storyline" was presented.[75][89] The season two/volume 2 finale generated 11.06 million viewers in the ratings, down more than 3 million viewers from the season opener and series pilot.[90]While the show premiered with high ratings, ratings slowly diminished throughout its run. The first episode of season two was the highest viewed, whereas each successive season had fewer viewers than the one preceding it.Season three of Heroes started with strong ratings that dropped steadily throughout the season. The season's finale placed last in its timeslot.[91]The season four premiere of Heroes was the lowest rated episode of the series to that point, averaging 5.9 million viewers.[92] Despite the season's low ratings, executive producer Tim Kring was "fully expecting" a fifth season.[93] However, while creator Kring was hopeful over the show's future many media insiders were not so confident. There was growing speculation on some news sites that NBC would cancel the series at the conclusion of its fourth season [94] or that it might renew the show for a fifth and final season by ordering either 6 or 13 episodes and possibly airing them as a backup or mid-season replacement.[95] On May 14, 2010, NBC made it official that Heroes was indeed cancelled.[96]Following the debut of Heroes in 2006, the tagline Save the Cheerleader, Save the World was recognized within the television industry as an effective marketing device.[98] In 2006, NBC also created a Heroes parody entitled Zeroes. Zeroes, which was released as a viral video on sites including YouTube, features parodies including four chapters and an open audition. Development and production of the project was kept secret from Tim Kring.[99] NBC hosted panels at the 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 Comic-Cons in San Diego to promote the series. Major announcements have been made during the panel, along with sneak peeks of forthcoming seasons. In 2006, the Heroes panel presented the entire season one 72-minute pilot. In 2008 the first half of the season three premiere was shown. Comic-Con also allows the cast and crew to answer questions from the press and from fans.[100][101] On July 21, 2007, Tim Kring announced that cast and crew members of Heroes would travel the world for the Heroes World Tour to promote the season one DVD release and the forthcoming season two. The tour took place in North America (New York and Toronto), Asia (Singapore, Tokyo, and Hong Kong) and Europe (Munich, Paris and London). The tour began on August 26, and ended on September 1, 2007.[102] The post-hardcore bands Alesana and I See Stars have both respectively named songs after the show, "This is Usually the Part Where People Scream" and "Save the Cheerleader".The first DVD release of Heroes was a sampler disc, containing only the first episode, and was released in the UK and the Republic of Ireland on September 3, 2007.[103] UK Region 2 split Heroes into two halves on its initial release; part one being released on October 1, 2007 and part two on December 10, 2007.[104][105] When the second part was released, a complete first season boxset was also released on the same day on both DVD and HD DVD formats[106] The complete first season DVD includes nearly 3 hours of bonus features including: an extended 73-minute version of the pilot episode with audio commentary; 50 deleted and extended scenes; behind the scenes featurettes, including the making of Heroes, stunts, a profile of artist Tim Sale, and the score; and audio commentaries with cast, crew and show creator Tim Kring.[107] On February 22, 2008, the Heroes Season One DVD was nominated for a 2008 Saturn Award, in the category of "Best Television Series on DVD."[81] The complete first season was released in USA and Canada on August 28, 2007.[108] It was released in Australia and New Zealand on September 17, 2007.[107]Universal Studios Home Entertainment and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has announced that the first and second seasons would be released on Blu-ray on August 26, 2008, the same date as the DVD release of the second season.

The show follows former "psychic" Patrick Jane (Simon Baker), who is now a consultant to the fictional California Bureau of Investigation (CBI), using the highly developed observational skills he previously employed to "read" peoples' minds. The Mentalist was released on iTunes on October 1, 2012.[citation needed]On March 14, 2012, CBS announced that The Mentalist had been renewed for a fifth season, which premiered on September 30, 2012.[2]The Mentalist follows Patrick Jane, an independent consultant for the fictional California Bureau of Investigation (CBI) based in Sacramento, California. Although not an officer of the law of any sort, he uses skills from his former career as a successful, yet knowingly and admittedly fraudulent psychic medium to help a team of CBI agents solve various crimes. The ultimate goal of Patrick Jane and his cooperation with the CBI is to track down the killer known as "Red John" who was responsible for the brutal murders of Patrick's wife and daughter.Patrick Jane formerly had a lucrative career as a con man, successfully posing as a psychic medium and enjoying near-celebrity status. He appeared on television to claim that his paranormal abilities helped the police profile a serial killer named Red John. Red John, angered by the perceived slight, murdered Jane's wife and young daughter in revenge. Jane subsequently abandoned his job as a psychic and teamed with the CBI, using his skills to help them solve various crimes. His main focus is on the cases involving Red John or Red John copycats. He admits to faking the supernatural aspects of his skills, often asserting that "there's no such thing as psychics," yet he has finely honed skills in cold reading, hypnotism, and pickpocketing, as well as powerful observational skill and a deep insight into the human psyche and behavior. These skills come in handy in every episode, but his unorthodox and bizarre techniques to solve crimes sometimes offend the team of agents with whom he works.The show often sets episodes in fictional locales with names like Salinger Mill and Rancho Rosa. Like the majority of American television shows, The Mentalist is mostly filmed within the studio zone in Los Angeles County, but occasionally films a few scenes on location in Sacramento.On October 15, 2008, CBS ordered a full (the first) season of The Mentalist.[3] On May 20, 2009, CBS renewed The Mentalist for a second season, which premiered on September 24, 2009, in the US[4] and on September 22 on CTV in Canada,[5] as well as September 28, 2009, in Australia. On May 19, 2010, CBS announced that The Mentalist was renewed for a third season.[6] On May 18, 2011, the show was officially renewed for a fourth season, and on March 14, 2012, CBS renewed the show for a fifth season.Warner Home Video has released the first three seasons on DVD in Regions 1, 2, and 4. Season 4 will be released on September 18, 2012[7] in Region 1, October 8, 2012[8] in Region 2 and on October 31, 2012 in Region 4.[9]The pilot episode had an audience of 15.6 million viewers in its first airing, and 7.8 million in a re-airing three days later.[18] The December 2, 2008, episode ("Flame Red") was the highest-rated television show of the week, marking the first time a program in its first season had achieved that distinction since Desperate Housewives four years earlier.[19]The show has been criticized as being a rip-off of Psych.[20][21]On November 6, 2009, TNT announced that it had obtained exclusive syndication rights for The Mentalist and would begin airing old episodes of the series starting in the fall of 2011.[31] In Greece, the series premiered in 2009 on pay-TV service NovaCinema 1, the first season premiered in February 7, 2011 on Star Channel, and so far season 2 has been broadcast. In India, The Mentalist premiered on November 2010 on Zee Cafe and was re-aired from May 14, 2012 (Season 1 to Season 4).The Mentalist at TV.com1 Synopsis2 Production3 Cast and characters

His backstory is that he spent his childhood in traveling carnivals with his mean-spirited con-man father who taught him to see all outsiders as marks. He met his wife, Angela, who was also a carny, and together they left the carnival life. Honing the skills his father taught him, Jane became a successful psychic and medium. Red John murdered Angela and their daughter Charlotte in retaliation for Jane's televised challenge. Jane now works as a criminal consultant for the California Bureau of Investigation. Jane has started to develop close friendships with his colleagues, especially his boss, Senior Special Agent Teresa Lisbon. He usually presents his jocular, teasing face, but he shows his darker side when dealing with Red John. At those times, Jane becomes intense, focused, and willing to go to great lengths to capture and even kill him. He owns a classic French car, a robin egg blue Citron DS. As an avid tea drinker, he shows a certain liking to lapsang souchong at multiple occasions.Robin Tunney as Senior Special Agent Teresa Lisbona senior special agent with the CBI and leader of the Serious Crime Unit of which Patrick is part. Though Patrick often annoys her with his unusual behavior and going behind her back, she views him as a valuable member of the team and will almost always back him up. Her mother was killed in a drunk driving accident, leaving her to care for her brothers and her abusive alcoholic father. She is the only member of the team Patrick trusts with details of his past and they work well together, though his attitude often causes trouble for her. Her team is responsible for the Red John case, although the responsibility for catching Red John was taken over briefly by Sam Bosco, her mentor when she was a junior agent, until he and his team were murdered by one of Red John's operatives. Although there has never been a demonstrated romantic link between Jane and Lisbon in any episode, the writers have not eliminated it as a plausible possible development for future episodes. At the very least she is one of the few people that Jane truly cares about, and she is seen from time to time affected by his charm.Tim Kang as Special Agent Kimball Choa special agent with the CBI and a member of Lisbon's Serious Crime Unit. Cho has a dry, deadpan sense of humor and is good friends with Rigsby. He is often the one who sees through Patrick's parlor tricks (when Patrick tells Van Pelt that he was moving a straw across the table with telekinesis, Cho simply says, "He blew on it"). He was secretly called Ernie by the Bosco team, who also refer to Rigsby as Bert; Cho claims not to mind, as "Ernie's the clever, handsome one." He was a member of a street gang, the Avon Park Playboys, garnering a juvenile record, which is sealed. He also spent time in juvenile hall, until leaving to serve in the U.S. Army Special Forces, before becoming a police officer and then joining the CBI. Because of his difficult childhood, Cho often befriends kids who have committed crimes, possibly because they remind him of himself at that age.Owain Yeoman as Special Agent Wayne Rigsbya special agent with the CBI and a member of Lisbon's Serious Crime Unit, serving as an arson specialist. He served two years as a San Diego arson investigator before joining CBI. He developed strong feelings for Van Pelt. He didn't initially act on them, as romance between agents is against regulations, but ultimately the two gave in to their feelings and began seeing each other secretly. Their relationship ultimately became public knowledge, and so an ultimatum was issued to them by Madeleine Hightower to end their relationship, which they did to protect both of their careers. They remain friends and colleagues, despite the awkwardness of the working environment. Rigsby's father is a former career criminal who used to be part of a notorious biker gang. To save his father from going back to jail for parole violations, Rigsby lies to his father's parole officer. This forces Cho to lie to SPU during an investigation into the murder of cop killer Todd Johnson while in CBI custody.Amanda Righetti as Special Agent Grace Van Pelta special agent with the CBI and a member of Lisbon's Serious Crime Unit, serving as its newest member, often doing research for other members. She has a deep belief in religion and psychics and will butt heads with Patrick when he dismisses it or does something morally inappropriate. Van Pelt became secretly involved with Rigsby after months of reluctance owing to the regulations prohibiting romantic relationships between agents (although Jane has always known about it, thanks to his superpowersin fact, he even encouraged Rigsby and Van Pelt to act on their desires before they proceeded to second base). She is subdued and very organized, which leads Jane to deduce during the first season that this is because she is hiding some deep emotional trauma. She was engaged to FBI Agent Craig O'Laughlin, whom she killed after he revealed himself as one of Red John's accomplices.Red Johna nickname for the show's leading antagonist. He is a serial killer thought to have murdered at least 28 people, including Patrick Jane's wife and daughter, five years before the pilot episode. Red John often taunts Jane, and saved Jane's life when he was about to be killed by Red John copycats; he parted from Jane on that occasion by quoting the opening stanza of "The Tyger" by William Blake. His crimes and "associates" are portrayed in every season of the series, although the character has been seen fully on screen only once, disguised for complete anonymity.[citation needed] Locating and killing Red John is Jane's primary motivation for assisting the CBI.Gregory Itzin as Supervising Agent Virgil Minellithe former special agent in charge of the CBI until the Season 2 episode "His Red Right Hand." Minelli was an effective team leader, yet appeared fatigued and exhausted from years of political battles with his subordinates and his superiors. Nevertheless, he behaved in a paternal and friendly way to Lisbon's team. Minelli is finally pushed to his breaking point following the murders of Sam Bosco and his team by Rebecca, their secretary and a member of Red John's network; these were the first agents ever to die under his command. As a result, Minelli retired to a quiet life as a fisherman and was replaced by Madeleine Hightower. In the Season 3 episode "Jolly Red Elf," Minelli is approached by Patrick for support in Patrick's investigation into Red John's network, and Minelli ultimately agrees to help him.Aunjanue Ellis as Supervising Agent Madeleine Hightowerthe former special agent in charge of the CBI. In the Season 2 episode "The Red Box," Hightower arrives to take command, replacing Virgil Minelli. She is very much in command of the team and is one of the few people to have a hold on Patrick Jane. Despite adopting a hard-nosed by-the-book approach to managing the CBI, and her own skill as an administrator, she maintains an efficient and friendly relationship with the team. She also respects and sees Jane as valuable to the CBI and its future, and seems to understand Patrick's focus on finding Red John. Hightower is in the middle of a divorce and has two children. In Season 3, Hightower is among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and is considered a prime suspect owing to her previous relationship with one of Johnson's victims; this, along with evidence planted at the scene of the murder of Johnson's accomplice, Manuel Montero, ultimately leaves Hightower a wanted fugitive. Jane realizes Hightower was framed by Red John's accomplice, the true killer, and helps her escape; he then works throughout Season 3 to identify the true CBI mole. In the Season 3 finale, Hightower resurfaces, realizing Red John is closing in, and works with Jane and the team to expose the moleFBI agent Craig O'Laughlin; who is shot and killed by Hightower and Van Pelt in a showdown at Hightower's hideout.Pruitt Taylor Vince as Special Agent/Supervising Agent J.J. LaRochethe head of CBI's Internal Affairs. He arrives in the Season 3 episode "Jolly Red Elf," appointed the new head of the CBI's Professional Standards Unit. Following the demise of a member of Red John's network, Todd Johnson, while in custody at the CBI, LaRoche had been brought in to question the team after Johnson's death appeared to be an inside job. He is quirky, charmless, professional, socially awkward and Patrick's intellectual equal. But despite his "Robo-Cop" act, he has been shown to be a relatively normal person when not directly engaged in his job, dropping the veneer when he is around Jane. LaRoche initially considered Jane his prime suspect, but ultimately named Agent Hightower as the killer owing to evidence planted by Red John's mole, who was the true killer. With Hightower a fugitive, LaRoche was appointed to take over Hightower's duties as the team's supervisor and Jane's boss. LaRoche quickly asserted his command when he briefly removed Lisbon and replaced her with Cho, promoting him to team leader, but later reappointed Lisbon as team leader (after commending Cho's stint as acting leader, in Cho's file) and makes it very clear that he had removed Lisbon to show he would not tolerate any disrespect. In the Season 3 finale, Jane blackmailed LaRoche into handing over the suspect list by threatening to reveal LaRoche's dark secret; Jane later admits he has absolutely no idea what LaRoche's dark secret is, "but it must be horrible." In Season 4, LaRoche revealed to Lisbon that he is leaving his temporary assignment with the CBI Major Crimes Unit and is returning to Professional Services. LaRoche states his time working with Lisbon and Jane has been "interesting" and then awkwardly hugs Lisbon, who wishes him luck. LaRoche returns in season 5's "Blood Feud" to investigate Rigsby shooting a gang leader who had caused the death of Rigsby's father. LaRoche decides that officially Rigsby acted as part of his job but makes it clear he believes Jane manipulated events so Rigsby could take revenge for his father.Michael Rady as Supervising Agent Luther WainwrightIn the season 4 episode "Ring Around the Rosie," Wainwright takes command of Lisbon's team. He is shown to be quite young and intelligent, but also arrogant. Later episodes show Wainwright being mellow and generally not taking a very active role in Lisbon's cases, other than giving the team deadlines or incentives for the high-profile ones. In the Season 4 finale, "The Crimson Hat," Wainwright is the tragic victim of one of Red John's most dastardly plots to date. Red John lures Jane out to an empty lot. Jane is followed by the CBI team, and they are unknowingly followed by the FBI. When the car supposedly containing Red John tries to escape, FBI agents shoot and kill both the driver and the backseat passenger (thought to be Red John). When they open the door to remove him, they find they have actually shot Wainwright, tied up and gagged, with a speaker around his neck to transmit Red John's voice.Michael Gaston as director of CBI Gale Bertram; the bureau director of the entire California Bureau of Investigation, first appointed in the Season 3 premiere "Red Sky at Night." Bertram appears to be mostly concerned with politics and the media, but has been shown to be well aware of Lisbon's team and her effectiveness at closing cases and has a high regard for Jane's productiveness and worth as a CBI asset. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed that Bertram was among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed Bertram was the killer, FBI agent Craig O'Laughlin was revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer. In Season 4, Bertram suspends Lisbon and her team in retaliation. Throughout his appearances, there have been minor indications that he is connected to Red John, most notably when, in the Season 3 episode "Red Queen," he refers to a poem of William Blake, a poet whom Red John had also referenced personally to Patrick Jane, and again in the Season 4 premiere, Bertram secretly directs District Attorney Ardiles to lead the prosecution against Jane at his murder trial, after suspending Lisbon and her team.Catherine Dent as Susan Darcy, an FBI agent assigned to the Panzer case in season 4 episode "Blinking Red Light." In "Always Bet on Red" she quickly becomes suspicious of Jane's claim that Red John is dead. He is in fact alive, something Jane doesn't want Darcy to find out, as Red John would kill her for having such knowledge. In the episode "Cheap Burgundy," Darcy asked Jane to assist her with a case she was investigating, but during the investigation she kept trying to confirm that Red John was alive, but Jane kept denying it. During one such conversation, it was confirmed that Susan lost a sister to drowning and that she blamed herself for what happened. At the end of the episode, Jane reluctantly admitted that Red John was alive. Darcy accused Jane of being one of Red John's friends and disciples, and finally tells Wainwright she is going to "bring (Jane) down."Rebecca Wisocky as Brenda Shettrick, the head of the CBI's Media Relations Unitshe is entirely concerned with liaising with the media and leading outreach programs and other efforts to the public; she appears to have good relations with the team and senior agents. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed that Shettrick was among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed that CBI director Gale Bertram was the killer, FBI agent Craig O'Laughlin was ultimately revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer.David Norona as Osvaldo Ardiles, an assistant district attorney who quickly proves to be an enemy of the team when he tries to convict an innocent man of armed robbery in an effort to get information on a powerful Mafia group. Cho, realizing Ardiles' plan would never work, and that Ardiles himself was not going to listen to Cho, proved the man's innocence. Ardiles, furious, retaliated by cutting off all support from the D.A.'s office to the team. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed that Ardiles was among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed that CBI director Gale Bertram was the killer, FBI agent Craig O'Laughlin was ultimately revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer. In the Season 4 premiere, Ardiles, at Bertram's direction, tries to charge Jane with killing Timothy Carter, but in the end Jane was cleared of all charges, and Ardiles lost the case.Leslie Hope as Kristina Fryean alleged psychic who has occasionally worked with the CBI. When they first met, she and Patrick were at odds. Patrick believes she is a fake, owing to his own awareness that psychics do not exist. Later, he becomes emotional after Frye states to Patrick that she has spoken with his dead wife about their daughter's final moments. As time goes by, Kristina helps out with more murder cases, and romantic sparks start to fly between her and Patrick. In the Season 2 finale, Kristina is put under protection by the CBI when she attempts to reach out to Red John, andas Patrick had fearedKristina later disappears from her heavily guarded home. In the Season 3 episode "Blood on His Hands," Kristina is found alive but unresponsive, after four months of being missing, through a tipoff from Visualize leader Brett Stiles. After Jane attempts to communicate with her in a sance, she tells him that she is dead, which Jane denies. She appears to be at peace, wryly teasing Jane. She is unaware of the circumstances of her disappearance and cannot or will not provide any information of value to Jane. She is, to date, catatonic and presumably institutionalized.Terry Kinney as Sam Boscoa senior special agent with the CBI and another team leader. He was Lisbon's mentor when she was a junior agent, and despite being married, he shared strong romantic feelings for her until he died. When Bosco became an investigative team leader in the new Serial Crimes Unit, Virgil Minelli gave Bosco the responsibility for catching Red John. He was Patrick Jane's office nemesisbased on a lack of trust, they had an antagonistic relationship. Patrick didn't trust Bosco to properly investigate the Red John case, and Bosco viewed Jane as untrustworthy and unreliable. In the Season 2 episode "His Red Right Hand," Bosco's team was murdered by Rebecca, their secretary and a member of Red John's network. Rebecca confirms to Jane that Red John ordered the murders because he knows that Jane wants the case. Only Bosco lived long enough to arrive alive, but in critical condition, at the hospital. Shortly before he died Bosco made peace with Patrick, who confirmed to Bosco that he would kill Red John.Eric Winter as FBI agent Craig O'Laughlina special agent in charge who first meets (through a car crash) the CBI team while jointly investigating Visualize. O'Laughlin catches the attention of Van Pelt, and the two of them have instant chemistry. Over time, their romance deepens; in the episode "Blood for Blood," O'Laughlin asks her to marry him and she agrees, much to Rigsby's displeasure. He is shown to have seniority, technical expertise, high intelligence and combat skill. His past before joining the FBI includes his being a National Football League player who knew (and fondly remembers) Van Pelt's father, and a learned traveler of the Far East. In the Season 3 finale, it was revealed O'Laughlin is among Agent LaRoche's five suspects in the Todd Johnson murder, and while it was initially believed CBI director Gale Bertram was the killer, O'Laughlin was revealed as Red John's accomplice and the true killer. In a showdown at Hightower's hideout, O'Laughlin shot and wounded Lisbon and made it clear he was Red John's accomplice. A wounded Lisbon musters enough strength to throw and hit O'Laughlin with a sofa pillow. While O'Laughlin is distracted for the split second by getting hit with the sofa pillow, Van Pelt and Hightower draw their firearms and shoot O'Laughlin, fatally wounding him.Bradley Whitford as Fake Red John/Timothy Cartera child abductor and one of Red John's accomplices. He kidnapped a young girl named Debbi Lupin and kept her locked up in his basement with his wife as an accomplice. In the Season 3 final episode "Strawberries and Cream," after Craig O'Laughlin is killed while trying to kill Hightower in her mountain cabin hideout, Jane (who is in a food court in a Sacramento mall) has Lisbon use the redial on O'Laughlin's phone and tell whoever answers that O'Laughlin is dead. Timothy is sitting in the food court near Jane and answers his phone. Jane, seeing this, has Lisbon tell him what the person she called said to her. It is the same thing that Timothy in the food court said, so Jane confronts him. Timothy first denies it, but moments later drops hints that he is Red John, keeping Jane at a safe distance by subtly pointing a revolver hidden inside a folded newspaper at him. Jane, however, is still skeptical, and confronts the man again as he tries to leave, only for him to reveal to Jane details of the murders of his wife and daughter, specifically, what they smelled like. This sends Jane over the edge; he calls after the man and then guns him down with a weapon hidden in his coat pocket. Jane then sits down and calmly sips tea while waiting to be arrested, apparently satisfied that this man was indeed Red John. In the Season 4 premiere, it is revealed that Timothy Carter is not really Red John after all, after Jane tricks Carter's wife into revealing that they had kidnapped Debbi. In the Season 4 episode "Little Red Book," Patrick takes Rosalind Harker, Red John's blind ex-girlfriend, to the morgue where Carter's body is stored, and has her feel its face to check if she recognizes him. After doing so, Rosalind confirms Patrick's suspicionsCarter was not the man who identified himself as "Roy Tagliaferro" (one of Red John's aliases).Jillian Bach as Sarah Harrigana public defender whom the team first meet in the Season 3 episode "Every Rose Has Its Thorn," where she is a client at a matchmaking service. Her interest is piqued by Rigsby during an interview regarding an alibi she provides to a suspect, after which she asks him out on a date, which he accepts. She and Rigsby continue their relationship during season 4, where she is assigned as the legal counsel for a suspect the team are interviewing in one episode. During another episode, she assists Rigsby with his upcoming testimony for a case that has gone to trial, before they consummate their relationship. She announces in "My Bloody Valentine" that she is pregnant. In "Black Cherry" it is revealed that Sarah is now an ADA with DA's office.Samaire Armstrong as Summer Edgecombe a prostitute recruited by Cho as a confidential informant in Season 4.

She becomes Jane's lover and eventually is captured alive by the CBI at the end of Season 4.David Warshofsky as Donald "Donny" Culpepper a professional thief that the CBI first comes across in the Season 2 episode "A Price Above Rubies," where he is a suspect in a case involving a thief who critically wounds the husband of a wealthy jewelry store owner. He is proven innocent but does not appreciate Jane's insults and threatens physical harm or worse if they meet again. They apparently reconcile by the Season 3 episode "Redacted," as Jane hires him to steal Agent LaRoche's Todd Johnson murder suspect list from LaRoche's home. Culpepper fails to find it and gets caught. He tells Jane that if Jane does not get the charges dropped, Culpepper will tell CBI what he was doing. Lisbon gets the charges dropped by punching Culpepper in the face. In the Season 3 finale, Jane admits to having hired Culpepper, telling this directly to LaRoche, but avoids punishment by threatening to reveal LaRoche's dark secret, which Jane claims Culpepper discovered while searching through LaRoche's safe, then revealed to Jane while in custody. Jane later admits that Culpepper learned nothing about LaRoche's secret.Alicia Witt as Rosalind Harkera blind woman, Rosalind had a relationship with Red John, who called himself by the alias Roy Tagliaferro. According to her, his car broke down near her home and she wound up spending the next few months in a relationship with him. He left her without saying goodbye, though he did draw one of his smiley faces on a wall in her house. In the Season 1 finale episode "Red John's Footsteps," Patrick and Lisbon find her and get a description of Red John. In the end of Season 4 episode "Little Red Book," Patrick contacts Rosalind and brings her to a morgue where the body of Timothy Carter, one of Red John's accomplices who had manipulated Patrick into killing him by pretending to be Red John himself, was kept. He has her feel Carter's face to see if she can identify him. She tells him that she has never meet the man before, confirming Patrick's suspicions that Red John is still alive.Currie Graham as Walter Mashburna highly successful billionaire businessman. He first appears in the Season 2 episode "Redline" as a murder suspect, but is cleared by Patrick, for whom he has quickly grown respect. This respect deepens in the Season 3 episode "Red Hot," where Mashburn is saved from assassination attempts, and along the way develops a (brief) romance with Lisbon.Jack Plotnick as Brett Partridgea CBI forensic specialist who has appeared in two episodes. He is very minor and is not named on screen. Jane states Brett "loves his job a bit too much" and calls him a ghoul.David Paymer as James Panzera serial killer known as the San Joaquin Killer who appeared in the Season 4 episode "Blinking Red Light." James Panzer pretended to be a blogger devoting his life to find a serial killer known as the San Joaquin Killer (SJK). SJK killed at least five young women, ranging in age from 16 to 20, two of which murders were seen in the episode. In actuality, however, Panzer was the San Joaquin Killer himself. Patrick Jane suspected Panzer of being SJK. Jane's suspicions were borne out when he and Panzer both appeared on Karen Cross's television show discussing the SJK case. During the show, Jane goaded Panzer into comparing Red John unfavorably with SJK. Panzer rose to the bait, saying that the SJK killings were the work of a genius and Red John by comparison was a "common sociopath, lazy, sloppy, delusional," and becoming so absorbed in building up SJK's image that he was unaware that he was making the same mistake that Patrick Jane and Kristina Frye had made: namely, belittling Red John in a public forum. Shortly after the television appearance, Panzer was found murdered in an alleyway, with Red John's smiley face painted in blood on the wall near his body. Panzer's murder proved Jane's theory that Red John is still alive.Shauna Bloom as Rebeccaan assistant on Sam Bosco's team at CBI, and one of Red John's accomplices. Rebecca's past has not been fully revealed, but some details are known. According to Patrick Jane, she had an unhappy childhood and was molested by a close relative. The molestation led to her developing a strong sense of self-loathing, which manifested itself as self-abuse and self-medication. In the Season 2 episode "His Red Right Hand," Rebecca killed Bosco and two other agentsunder orders from Red Johnso that Lisbon's team, and Patrick, would be given the case back. Also under Red John's orders, and using the alias Agent Rojo (Spanish for "red"), she stole a body and evidence that could have brought Lisbon's team closer to identifying Red John. Rebecca was killed (by poison), very likely by Red John himself (disguised as a guard), in CBI.Malcolm McDowell as Bret Stilesthe leader of the Visualize Self-Realization Center church. Stiles is an ambiguous church leader who is charismatic, smooth, and skilled. He has succeeded in deflecting investigations from the authorities on numerous occasions and has hinted to Patrick that he has inside knowledge about Red John. On their last meeting, Bret provided information that led to Jane and the CBI recovering Kristina Frye alive (but catatonic). Soon afterward, Bret left to open a Visualize center in Jakarta, with his representatives claiming not to know when he might return. Stiles does return in the fourth season episode "His Thoughts Were Red Thoughts," and is charged with murdering an anticult activist. However, Jane helps prove Stiles's innocence, leading Stiles to say that he owes Jane a favor.eljko Ivanek as Dr. Linus Wagnera partner of the victim in "Pilot" episode, where double homicide which looks as though it may have been committed by the serial killer Red John.

Alicia returns to her old job as a litigator (after taking 12 years out to be a stay-at-home mother) to provide for her two children.[9] The series was partly inspired by the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal,[10] as well as by other prominent American political sex scandals, particularly those of John Edwards and Bill Clinton:Michelle [King]: We came up with the idea about a year and half ago. There had been this waterfall of these kinds of scandals, from Bill and Hillary [Clinton], to Dick Morris, to Eliot Spitzer, to name just a few. I think theyre all over our culture. And there was always this image of the husband up there apologizing and the wife standing next to him. I think the show began when we asked, "What are they thinking?" And Robert and I started talking about it from there. ... You know, whats interesting about a lot of these political scandals is that the women are lawyers, too. Hillary [Clinton] is a lawyer. Elizabeth Edwards is a lawyer. I think that got us thinking along those lines. That is, we knew she had to go back to work, and we had so many female lawyers to draw on.[11]The series was created by Robert King and Michelle King who also serve as executive producers and show runners.[2] The pair had produced the short-lived legal drama In Justice that aired as a mid-season replacement in early 2006.[19] The creators had previously worked extensively in feature films.

It scored a Metacritic rating of 76 out of 100 based on the views of 26 critics.[45] In reviewing the first early episodes many critics praised the acting talents of the cast. The Chicago Tribune commended the show saying "one of the best parts of the show is Alicia's complicated relationship with her husband, who humiliated his family with a sex scandal but also appears to be a pawn in a larger game being played by high-level politician".[46]The New York Daily News report, in a review of the lead character's performance said "Margulies puts a powerful combination of cold fury, bewilderment and tenacity into Alicia Florrick, the wife of a disgraced Chicago politician in a new series that readily admits it ripped itself from the headlines"[47] while The Baltimore Sun predicted that "With all four [actors] bringing their 'A' games to the pilot, it looks as if CBS could have another winning 10 o'clock drama."[citation needed]There were a few reservations as to the long-term success and plot of the show, with the San Francisco Chronicle concluding that "There's nothing inherently wrong with The Good Wife other than it's a legal series with too many close-up shots of knowing glances and 'attagirl Alicia' moments of empowerment that you saw coming 20 minutes prior".[48]The second season of the show was generally better received than the first. It currently sits at 89 out of 100 on Metacritic indicating universal acclaim.[49]Time magazine's James Poniewozik named it one of the Top 10 TV Series of 2010[50] and 2011, saying, "The ability to keep growing: that's what makes a good Wife great".[51] The Salt Lake Tribune in its list of the Top 10 series of 2011 ranked The Good Wife No. 3, explaining "The mix of fascinating legal drama and even more fascinating personal drama is superb."[52]AOL named Alicia the 19th Most Memorable Female TV Character.[53]The Good Wife at TV.com1 Pilot2 Main cast

The show is produced by The Barn Productions Inc., David Mamet Entertainment, and Fire Ants Films in association with 20th Century Fox Television.The show purports to describe the daily lives of Delta Force (called "The Unit" in the show) operators during training and operational missions as well as their families back home.Internationally, The Unit premiered on October 3, 2006, in the United Kingdom on Bravo; on October 11, 2006, in Australia on the Seven Network and on FOX8 and Arena on Foxtel/Austar pay-TV network and now airs on 7Two on Tuesdays at 8:30pm; on January 11 in Spain on La Sexta; on January 25 in The Netherlands on RTL 5; on March 7 in Germany on Sat. 1; on September 23 in Bulgaria on bTV; on March 9, 2008, in Russia on DTV; and on June 13, 2009, in Vietnam on VTC7-Today TV, in Turkey by TNT.The theme music for the first and second season was "Fired Up" by Robert Duncan. Although the show focuses on an Army special ops unit, "Fired Up" is an adaptation of a Marine Corps running cadence called "Fired Up, Feels Good". Duncan also created "Walk the Fire", a 22-second segment used as a theme since season three."The Unit" is the U.S. Army colloquial term for Delta Force. Its recruits are selected from the United States Army (primarily from the 75th Ranger Regiment and Special Forces Groups). The few who pass selection then undergo several more years of sophisticated and rigorous training for counter-terrorism, reconnaissance, and direct action missions. In a TV interview, series creator Eric Haneywho is a former Delta Force operatorstated that the term "Delta Force" is never used in the spec ops community. They are only referred to as "The Unit" and their DOD designation is "Combat Applications Group". The official cover name of The Unit in the show is the similar sounding "303rd Logistical Studies Group". In the third season's premiere, an onscreen read-out specifically identifies The Unit as "1st Special Actions Group", reminiscent of 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta.The Unit is based at a fictional army post, "Fort Griffith". The location of Fort Griffith is never explicitly stated, but in Episode 103, a bank statement of the lead character clearly shows an address for Fort Griffith, MO 63021, which puts it a few miles west of St. Louis. Other episodes make clear references to Greenwood, including mentions of Greenwood/Fort Griffith area, and local Greenwood police cars as well as Missouri license plates clearly appear in many episodes. Greenwood, Missouri is a small town located southeast of Kansas City. However the red, white and blue license plate is from the state of Idaho. This license plate can be seen in almost all the episodes. Unit members also wear the shoulder sleeve insignia of the inactivated 24th Infantry Division on their Class A uniforms, as well as the shoulder crest of the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, "Strike Hold", currently part of the 1st ABCT of the 82nd Airborne Division. In later episodes, Unit members are shown as wearing the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) patch on their Class A uniforms.The Unit's immediate chain of command goes to the commanding officer, Colonel Tom Ryanand, presumably, straight to the President of the United States. It is unknown if this bypasses the Secretary of Defense.The wives of The Unit's Alpha Team personnel are given minimal mission or operational information. They are responsible for maintaining the "303rd Logistical Studies Group" cover in all interactions with anyone who is not a Unit family member. Their husbands are, in fact, still performing highly dangerous missions, but they are not permitted to know specifics, such as where their husbands are deployed, what their training routines consist of, how long their assignments will last, or even if their husbands are safe.If a member of The Unit is killed in action, the family is told that he has been killed on a training mission. The wives themselves are encouraged to form a close, cohesive military family based on the common knowledge and strife this inevitably leads to.The Unit has an unconventional structure. With the size of a companyapproximately 130 operatorsit is commanded by a Colonel (companies are usually commanded by Captains; Colonels usually command elements such as brigades or regiments). This is parallel to Delta's structure, which was implemented by Col. Charles Alvin Beckwith. The CO, Colonel Ryan, normally wears a "sanitized" uniform (bearing absolutely no tapes, such as his name, or even U.S. Army, or rank insignia).Whereas a Special Forces ODA (Operational DetachmentAlpha) is commanded by a Captain, the Unit sends five-man teams into the field under non-commissioned officers, such as the team led by Command Sergeant Major Jonas Blane, The Unit's NCOIC of Alpha Team. It is possible that their soldiers have the same Special Forces specialties as in Army Special Forces. An ODA, formerly known as an "A-Team", has Weapons Sergeants, Engineering Sergeants, Medical Sergeants, Communications Sergeants, etc.The wives, if suspected of speaking about The Unit's existence, can cause their husbands to be expelled and returned to regular Army service. Colonel Ryan has stated, time and again, that this can ruin a soldier's career, as well as his marriage, and has also stated that he will not hesitate to destroy families in order to preserve The Unit's security. He has also threatened the wives with closing The Unit down, and restarting it somewhere else under another coverforcing the uprooting of all families involved.The Unit deploys throughout the world, and both the Army and United States government have the ability to deny the existence of The Unit and any of its members in order to prevent the onset of international incidents. Their uniforms are commonly not standard Army issue, which makes it easier to deny their connection with the US Army if they are killed or captured. They also carry weapons that are not always standard-issue, and the Unit's personnel are well-familiarized with weapons from around the world and can make themselves look like military personnel from other organizations. Unit members can and are sometimes also working as protection details for U.S. diplomats on visit overseas as well as foreign dignitaries and State Department designated VIPs on U.S. soil; in which cases they are attached to the Diplomatic Security Service and do carry the official DSS Special Agent badge.The Unit's members will frequently use code names such as Snake Doctor, Dirt Diver, Betty Blue, Cool Breeze and Hammer Head, as well as colors (Mr. White, Green, Blue, Black). These are usually used when working directly with American civilians, other English speakers not trained for emergencies, or on counter-terrorism missions. According to Jonas Blane, the order of precedence for his team after he is disabled, is, from top to bottom: Mack Gerhardt, Charles Grey, Hector Williams, and Bob Brown based on seniority.^** There are continuity errors regarding the rank of Jonas Blane. In "Pandemonium, Part 2", Blane states his rank as Command Sergeant Major, his uniform rank is Sergeant Major. In the United States Army, however, soldiers are often laterally transitioned between the ranks depending on their assignments. Command Sergeants Major are also addressed as "Sergeant Major" when in conversation, not "Command Sergeant Major". This is similar to the rules where a Staff Sergeant or Sergeant First Class are addressed simply as "Sergeant".^** Promoted from Staff Sergeant during "Side Angle Side".^** Although this might have just been dirty talk, a similar continuity error exists regarding the rank of Mack Gerhardt. In the season 1 episode "True Believers" his wife says to him "come here Sergeant Major, and give me a report," but his rank is later established as Master Sergeant. In the final wedding scene of season 4, however, Mack is shown with E-7, or Sergeant First Class, rank on his uniform.^** Promoted from Colonel during "Unknown Soldier".^* Formerly Morgan; married Grey in "Unknown Soldier".^* Formerly Canning; married Ryan in "The Wall".^ Killed in action after saving Grey's life, Beirut, Lebanon during "Five Brothers".Alpha team has used the callsigns Anaconda and Buckboard .According to an interview executive producer Shawn Ryan gave to The Futon Critic "[David] Mamet and I and our writers, we came up with a lot of great stuff," Ryan said about his pitch to CBS executives for a potential fifth season. "It was going to be a whole new show in the sense that we were going to be training some young people, Bob was going to be training some people for a whole new organization. Jonas was finally going to be seeing his run end......The final season was going to be, I figured the fifth season was going to be the last... It was going to be a long, sort of final mission for Jonas. He's not medically cleared, Mack has to go in and sort of change the medical records so that Jonas can keep on [going on missions]. We had a whole thing planned, it was going to be good." Jonas would eventually leave the army due to his injuries coupled with combat stress and reunite with Molly. Mack would take over the team but at the end of the series would also leave for a training post after Tiffy becomes pregnant with their third child. Bob would be badly injured in a parachuting accident and join the CIA as their Unit liaison. Ryan would take a demotion to regain control of The Unit whilst Bridget Sullivan would be killed on a mission halfway through the season. Charles Grey would take over as team leader with Sam McBride as his deputy training replacements for the personnel they have lost. Other storylines would include the recruitment of more female members, the team being hounded by human rights campaigners intent on bringing them to trial for their actions, the CIA creating its own rival commando force as a mirror image of The Unit, the search for a mole within the organization leaking information to the highest bidder, the Army's treatment of soldiers suffering debilitating injuries and combat stress and Sam McBride confiding to Bridget Sullivan that he is the Unit's first gay member.[7][8]France: July 4, 2007

The show stars Jeffrey Donovan, Gabrielle Anwar, Bruce Campbell, Sharon Gless, and, beginning in the fourth season, Coby Bell.[1] The series premiered on June 28, 2007, on USA Network.[2][3] On April 15, 2010, the show was renewed for its fifth and sixth seasons. The sixth season, set to include 18 episodes, began on June 14, 2012.[4] On November 7, 2012, the show was renewed for its seventh season.[5]The title of the series refers to the burn notices issued by intelligence agencies to discredit or announce the dismissal of agents or sources who are considered to have become unreliable. When spies are burned, their connection to an espionage organization is terminated, leaving them without access to cash or influence. According to the narration during the opening credits, the burned spy has no prior work history, no money, no support network in essence, no identity. The television series uses first-person narrative and frequent voice-overs providing exposition from the viewpoint of covert-operations agent Michael Westen, played by Jeffrey Donovan. The voice-over commentary is in the form of tips for fledgling agents as if for a training or orientation film.After fleeing a blown operation in Nigeria and being kidnapped and beaten, Westen finds himself in his hometown[6] of Miami, Florida. He is tended to by his ex-girlfriend, Fiona Glenanne, but he has been abandoned by all his normal intelligence contacts and is under continuous surveillance with his personal assets frozen. Extraordinary efforts to reach his U.S. government handler eventually yield only a grudging admission that someone powerful wants him "on ice" in Miami. If he leaves there, he will be hunted down and taken into custody. If he stays, he can remain relatively free. Consumed by the desire to find out who burned him, and why, Westen is reluctantly drawn into working as an unlicensed private investigator and problem solver for ordinary citizens to fund his personal investigation into his situation as a blacklisted agent.Westen invites his old friend Sam Axe to assist him, while Fiona invites herself to join them. With the occasional assistance and sometimes hindrance of his mother, Madeline, Westen battles an array of such criminal figures as mobsters, gangs, con artists, murderers, thieves, arms traffickers, kidnappers, money launderers, and drug traffickers. At the same time, Michael must follow the trail that leads him to the people responsible for his being burned, and later finding out why.The series juggles these two narratives; the overall series dealing with why Michael was burned, and individual episodes focusing on the cases he works for clients.The first season, consisting of 12 episodes, follows Michael's investigation into the identity of the man who burned him. It also introduced the main characters: Fiona, Michael's ex-girlfriend; Sam, a former Navy SEAL and Michael's best friend; and Madeline, Michael's hypochondriac mother. The season saw many appearances by Agents Harris and Lane (Marc Macaulay and Brandon Morris), two FBI agents sent to keep tabs on Michael. They were eventually replaced by Agent Bly (Alex Carter), who in turn was removed from Michael's case. By the end of the season, Michael has discovered the identity of the man who wrote his burn notice, Phillip Cowan (Richard Schiff), only to see him killed. Michael later is contacted by a mysterious woman, ending the season on a cliffhanger.The second season, consisting of 16 episodes, depicts Michael's struggle to discover more about his new "handler" and use her to get to the people that burned him. The season begins with Michael meeting Carla (Tricia Helfer), the woman on the phone from the previous season. He begins a professional relationship with her after she begins bringing him clients. Meanwhile, Madeline begins getting closer to learning about Michael's secret life. By the season finale, Fiona kills Carla, and Michael meets "Management" (John Mahoney), the leader of a professional black ops syndicate. After telling Management that he wants out, Michael leaps from a helicopter and into the ocean, effectively ending their relationship as well as the "protection" that Management had secretly been providing for Michael.The third season, consisting of 16 episodes, shows Michael in his quest to have his burn notice lifted. The season begins where the previous left off: Michael swims back to Miami, where he is met by Michelle Paxson (Moon Bloodgood), a Miami police detective who is intent on bringing Michael down. After he finally convinces her to stay away, Michael is approached by Tom Strickler (Ben Shenkman), an agent to the spies. Strickler claims that he can have Michael's burn notice lifted, but at a very high cost. Michael eventually must kill Strickler instead to save Fiona's life. In the meantime, Michael begins meeting Diego Garza (Otto Sanchez), a CIA agent who gives Michael information about his burn. However, after Strickler's death, Garza is murdered, and Michael is nearly back to square one. Later, Michael is confronted by Mason Gilroy (Chris Vance), a freelance psychopath who once worked for Strickler and confesses to the murder of Garza. Gilroy asks for Michael's help with an operation, and Michael, not wanting to let Gilroy get away with anything, follows. He discovers that Gilroy is attempting to break a high-risk felon out of prison. After Gilroy's murder, Michael learns the identity of the prisoner: Simon Escher (Garret Dillahunt), the man who committed the crimes for which Michael was framed. In the final scenes of the season, Michael is arrested and taken to a mysterious room.The fourth season, consisting of 18 episodes, follows Michael as he begins working for the people who burned him once again. As with most other seasons, the fourth season begins immediately after the events of the previous. Michael, still in prison, is visited by Vaughn (Robert Wisdom), a high-ranking member of management. He serves as Michael's new handler, bringing Michael various jobs and even participating in some. Over the events of the season, Michael inadvertently burns a spy himself: Jesse Porter, a counterintelligence operative. Michael eventually reconnects with Simon, who directs Michael to a telecommunications magnate named John Barrett (Robert Patrick). After luring Barrett to Miami, Michael discovers that a coded Bible contains a complete list of the people who burned him. Jesse soon discovers that Michael was the one who burned him, leading to a rift between the two. Michael later is forced to kill Barrett to save himself, but loses the Bible in the process. Eventually, Sam and Jesse are able to reclaim the list, and decide to give the list to Marv (Richard Kind), Jesse's old handler. However, Marv is killed by Tyler Brennen (Jay Karnes), one of Michael's old foes. Now in possession of the list, Brennen hires another of Michael's enemies, "Dead" Larry Sizemore (Tim Matheson), to help track down the people on the list. Instead, Larry kills Brennen, which signals Michael's betrayal to Vaughn. Vaughn returns to Miami to have Michael, Fiona, and Jesse killed. However, Sam and Madeline are able to track down a congressman (John Doman) who is able to call for help. Michael is finally taken to Washington D.C. where he is met by an unidentified man (Dylan Baker) who proclaims, "Welcome back."The fifth season, consisting of 18 episodes, begins six months after Michael successfully rejoins the CIA as a consultant. The man from the final scenes of the fourth season has been identified as Raines, and, along with Max (Grant Show), Michael begins hunting down and arresting all of the people on Simon's list. However, while pursuing the final man on the list, they discover that the man is dead, leaving many mysteries unsolved, perhaps forever. Even though no names remain on the list, Michael is still consumed with "inconsistencies" he has found in the files regarding his burn notice. Michael continues to work with Max until Max's murder, for which Michael is framed. Michael begins to pursue the real killer while simultaneously dodging any suspicions from Dani Pearce (Lauren Stamile), Max's replacement. After clearing his name on Max's murder by forcing the confession (and subsequent suicide) of the real killer, Michael finally comes face to face with the man who burned him: Anson Fullerton (Jere Burns), who is blackmailing Fiona to get Michael to do what he wants. After Michael and his team are repeatedly forced to commit crimes and complete increasingly dangerous missions on Anson's behalf, Fiona turns herself in, freeing Michael to pursue Anson without concern for her.The sixth season, consisting of 17 episodes,[21] begins with Fiona's arrest. An old nemesis, Agent Bly (Alex Carter), interrogates Fiona after she is arrested. Anson is now on the run after a failed attempt at capturing him nearly resulted in Sam and Agent Pearce being killed.When Fiona gets to prison she makes a new friend, but this friend eventually ambushes her, stating that she was hired to kill her. Meanwhile Michael does work for the CIA agent who trained him, Tom Card (John C. McGinley), to gain visitation rights to see Fiona. He eventually gets to see her in the third episode of the season. On Michael's way out of the prison, he is slipped a piece of paper with the name of a guard who is working with Fiona's assassin and his address. When Michael, Sam, and Jesse track him down, they find him dead in his living room, having been killed by Rebecca (Kristanna Loken), a rogue agent working for Anson. She joins the team when they find out that Anson is using her brother as leverage.Once they eliminate Anson's ability to blackmail Rebecca with her brother, she provides them with the information they need to track him down. The team finally captures Anson with the help of Nate in the episode "Shock Wave", but shortly after the CIA arrives, a gunshot from an unseen location hits Anson and Nate, killing them both. Fiona is released from prison at the end of this episode and helps Michael in his search for the man who killed his brother.After a lot of tiring work, the team finds the initials "T.G." in the Pryon file on Nate's killer. The initials are revealed to indicate Tyler Gray (Kenny Johnson), an off-the-books soldier for the Pryon group. While obtaining these files, Agent Pearce and Jesse are caught blackmailing a Pryon employee; as a result, Pearce is relocated to Mumbai.After the team finds out that Gray is hiding out in Panama, Card sanctions an off-the-books operation to take him down, with Agent Brady Pressman (Chad Coleman) taking point. When Michael finally captures him, Gray reveals that the operation is a sham: Card hired Gray to kill Anson and is planning a move that will kill Michael and his team. Unconvinced, Michael contacts Card and, after lying to Card that Gray escaped, Card tells Michael to stay where he is and that his operatives already have a lead on Gray. Shocked by the deception, Michael grabs Gray and escapes the building just minutes before an F-18 airstrike organized by Card levels the building. Unable to escape the circling F-18 in their getaway vehicle, Brady sacrifices himself by getting the team and Gray to move into the forest before he drives off as distraction. The jet destroys the vehicle, killing Brady in the process, while the team is left in Panama to ponder their next move with no resources on hand.Michael eventually confronts Card, who kills Gray right in front of him. Michael then shoots Card in the head after realizing Card had used both Anson and Gray for unauthorized operations around the world, and was making plans to use Michael in the same way. This makes Michael and his team targets in a CIA manhunt.Burn Notice: The Fall of Sam Axe is a prequel movie focusing on Sam Axe and is set before the events of Burn Notice, broadcast on USA on April 17, 2011.[22] It tells the story of Sam's days in the Navy SEALs leading up to him going to Miami and serves as a lead-in to the fifth season of Burn Notice.[23] Jeffrey Donovan directed the film and has a cameo appearance.Since 2008, Signet Books has published a series of Burn Notice novelizations under their Obsidian imprint:The show is filmed on location in and around Miami, Florida. The show has a permanent set built in the former Coconut Grove Convention Center in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood where most of the show is filmed. In August 2012, the Miami City Commission and Burn Notice producers reached a tentative agreement to allow Burn Notice to film at the Convention Center for one additional year, allowing for a seventh season of production in exchange for significantly higher rent, an agreement that must be approved by the City of Miami.[25]In 2011, David Raines, Scott Clements and Sherry Klein were nominated for "Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series" for Last Stand at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards.[26] The pilot episode written by Matt Nix won a 2008 Edgar Allan Poe Award, honoring the best in mystery, in the category "Best Television Episode Teleplay".[27] David Raines, Scott Clements and Sherry Klein were nominated for "Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series" for Burn Notice Series (One-Hour) at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2008.[26] Composer John Dickson won 2008 and 2009 ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards for "Top TV Series".

With his assets frozen, he is forced to live off his wits and any small investigative jobs he can find while he searches for answers about who has burned him and why. Highly skilled and extremely clever, he can think on his feet, often improvising electronic devices and using ordinary items ranging from duct tape to cake frosting in highly unorthodox ways to complete a job. He has two black belts or, as he puts it in one episode, "thirty years of karate" and is "rated with anything that fires a bullet or holds an edge". He has an uncanny ability to assume cover identities, working in numerous regional dialects and international accents. He believes that his unhappy childhood, largely at the hands of an abusive father, has helped to make him into a natural covert operative while also making close relationships difficult for him. He has a younger brother, Nate (Seth Peterson), who appeared in several episodes before being killed by a sniper in Season 6. Michael presents himself as a cynic hardened by experience but occasionally reveals a soft, and sometimes vulnerable, side. His favorite food is yogurt, which is featured or eaten by at least one of the characters in each episode. He has a volatile romantic relationship with Fiona.Gabrielle Anwar as Fiona Glenanne: A former IRA operative and Westen's ex-girlfriend. Fiona re-enters Michael's life when he is dumped in Miami and she decides to stay, quickly making herself valuable to him. Aside from serving as his firearms and explosives expert, she provides support to him on his investigations and, at times, assists him in missions to find out who burned him. In the pilot episode, she speaks with an Irish accent. In the second episode, she changes to an American accent, along with a change in her style of dress, in an effort to distance herself from her past and blend in, showing her own ability to adapt. She is both a complement to Michael and his match in many ways, both intellectually and tactically. Series creator Matt Nix has said about Michael and Fiona's relationship:[7]Bruce Campbell as Sam Axe: An aging, semi-retired covert operative and former Navy SEAL. With a low amount of cash-on-hand to his name, Sam spends most of his time sleeping with rich, older Miami women in exchange for food and shelter. He and Westen are old buddies; Sam is also Westen's last, tenuous contact in the official spy community. He presents himself as "the guy who knows a guy", and Michael frequently relies on Sam's seemingly inexhaustible list of contacts. Sam also uses the alias "Charles (or 'Chuck') Finley" frequently during jobs. It is revealed in the pilot that he is also an FBI informant, reporting on Westen under duress. Knowing this, Westen is able to pass false information to the FBI through Sam, who is glad to become his double agent. At some point in the past, Sam foiled Fiona's attempt to sell a large shipment of weapons to a Libyan arms dealer, costing her a good deal of money. As a result, Fiona initially is very hostile towards him, but the two eventually become very antagonistic friends. Sam will occasionally ask her for advice concerning his relationships with women, and Michael has said that the two of them make a good team.Sharon Gless as Madeline Westen: Michael's mother, "Maddie" is a chain-smoking retiree. Although attempting to keep a sense of gravitas and self-importance, she is family-oriented and fully supports both of her sons in times of need, as well as helping Michael with his clients. In the mid-season finale of the third season, she considers leaving Miami, but realizes her significance to his business. Until recently, she has had only infrequent communication with Michael, noting in the pilot that Michael has missed his father's funeral "by eight years". During the first few seasons, Michael does not relish her company, but he gradually grows to appreciate her strength and love. Despite this, her appeals for help are Michael's one great weakness, and she has the ability to persuade him to do as she wishes.Coby Bell as Jesse Porter (season 4present): A counterintelligence expert whom Michael unwittingly burns when Michael went looking for some classified files on a terrorist about whom Jesse had information. He comes to Michael for help, hoping to find and kill the people responsible for burning him, and gradually becomes part of Michael's team. He briefly considers killing Michael after discovering it was Michael who burned him, but instead grudgingly continues to work with the team, as he and Michael slowly reconcile. He is eventually reinstated, but soon finds he can no longer tolerate the "red tape" to do government work, and takes a job with a private security firm while remaining a vital component of Michael's team.Argentina: FX Latin America, Telef  under the title Operacin Miami ("Operation Miami")Australia: Network Ten, One HD, WArab world: America Plus, MBC ActionBrazil: FOX Brasil, Rede BandeirantesBelgium: 2BE, RTL-TVIBulgaria: bTV Action  under the title   ("Out of the game")Bangladesh: STAR WorldCanada: Showcase, Super Channel, Sries+  shown in French under the title Agent Libre ("Free Agent")China: CCTV-8Chile: FX Latin AmericaColombia: FX Latin America, RCN Television  under the title Burn Notice: Operacin MiamiCosta Rica: FX Latin AmericaCroatia: FOX Crime  under the title Odstrel ("The Culling")Czech Republic: Prima Cool  under the title Status: Nedouc ("Status: Ineligible")Denmark: TV3+Ecuador: Teleamazonas  under the title Operacin Miami ("Operation Miami")Estonia: TV3  under the title Viimane Hoiatus ("Last Warning")Finland: MTV3France: W9Germany: VOXGreece: NovaCinema 1Honduras: FXHong Kong: FOXHungary: RTL KLUB  under the title Minden lben ngy kanl ("Four spoons in each soup", equivalent to "four fingers in every pie")[29]Iceland: St 2India: STAR World, FXIndonesia: FOXIreland: FXIsrael: Yes Stars Action  under the title   ("Erased Agent")Italy: Fox  under the title Duro A Morire ("Die-hard")Japan: Fox Channel AsiaFOX CrimeNTVnetworkLatvia: TV6, TV3Lithuania: TV3  under the title Vilko Bilietas ("The Wolf's Ticket")Malaysia: 8TV, FOXMexico: FX Latin America, FOX Latin AmericaNetherlands: RTL5New Zealand: TV3, The BoxNigeria: M-Net WestNorway: Viasat 4Pakistan: STAR World, FX, MBC ActionPanama: TVMax  under the title Operacin Miami ("Operation Miami")Peru: FX Latin America, Canal 22Philippines: Solar TV, Jack TV, FOX, JACK City on BEAM 31Poland: TV Puls, AXN  under the title Tosamo szpiega ("The Identity of a Spy")Portugal: FOX  under the title Espio Fora-de-jogo ("Offside Spy", a football expression meaning "Spy Out of the Game")Puerto Rico: WAPA-TVRussia: TV-3 (Russia)  under the title   ("Black Mark")Serbia: FOX Crime and Radio Television of Serbia  under the title Nepouzdani agenti ("Unreliable Agents")Slovenia: POP TV  under the title Vohun v nemilosti ("Spy Out of Favor")Singapore: FOX and MediaCorp Channel 5South Africa: M-Net Action Channel[30]South Korea: FoxSpain: Fox Espaa and Cuatro, by March 2011 in FDF  under the title ltimo aviso ("Last Warning")Sri Lanka: STAR WorldSweden: TV6Switzerland: RTS Deux (Swiss-French), RSI La 1 (Swiss-Italian)Thailand: Fox ThailandTurkey: Fox TVUK: FX, 5*Venezuela: Televen  under the title Atrapado en Miami ("Trapped in Miami"), FX Latin AmericaAudio CommentariesGag reelAudition footageCharacters montageGirls Gone Burn Notice montageAction scenes montageAudio CommentariesGag reelDeleted scenesBehind-the-scenes featuretteSmash, Crash, Boom: Inside the Burn Notice Stunt Unit2009 San Diego Comic-Con InternationalThe Stunts of Burn NoticeBurn Notice Roasts White CollarWhite Collar Roasts Burn NoticeSam Axe's Guide to Ladies and LibationsRivalry of the Writer's RoomWhite Collar PilotPrequel set two years before Burn Notice season 1Extended version of feature never before seen on TVThe Fall of Jeffrey DonovanAudio CommentaryDeleted ScenesArmy of One Extended EpisodeDeleted ScenesThe Villains of Burn Notice FeaturetteGag ReelCommentary on Fail SafeOfficial Website on USABurn Notice on MyNetworkTVBurn Notice at the Internet Movie DatabasePrivate Practice is an American medical drama television program which premiered on September 26, 2007 on American Broadcasting Company (ABC). A spin-off of Grey's Anatomy, the series takes place at Seaside Wellness (formerly Oceanside Health & Wellness Group) and chronicles the life of Dr. Addison Montgomery, played by Kate Walsh, as she leaves Seattle Grace Hospital in order to join a private practice, in Los Angeles. Private Practice also revolves around the Addisons co-workers at Seaside Wellness, formally Oceanside Wellness, and how they deal with patients, and the practice while still finding time to live their everyday lives.The series was created by Shonda Rhimes, who also serves as executive producer, alongside Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, Mark Tinker, Craig Turk and Steve Blackman, who serve as showrunners due to Rhimes's duties on Grey's Anatomy.[1] On May 11, 2012, Private Practice was renewed for a sixth season.[2] The sixth season is the first to not feature Tim Daly[3] and was recently announced on October 19, 2012, to be the final season of the show.[4]On February 21, 2007, The Wall Street Journal reported that ABC was pursuing a spin-off of Grey's Anatomy featuring Kate Walsh's character Addison Montgomery.[5] Subsequent reports confirmed the report, stating that an expanded two-hour broadcast of Grey's Anatomy (which aired May 3, 2007) would serve as a backdoor pilot for the spinoff. The backdoor pilot episode features Montgomery on leave from Seattle Grace Hospital, the clinic in Los Angeles is named the Oceanside Wellness Centre.[6] The broadcast served as the 22nd and 23rd episodes of the season (out of 25), and was directed by Michael Grossman, according to Variety.[7] Gossip columnists Kristin Veitch and Michael Ausiello reported that the spinoff would be set in Los Angeles.[8][9]On May 3, 2007, the backdoor pilot of Private Practice aired on ABC, the pilot was in the double episode of Grey's Anatomy entitled "The Other Side of This Life", and gave a brief description of the characters in Private Practice. The cast included Amy Brenneman, Paul Adelstein, Tim Daly, Taye Diggs, Chris Lowell and Merrin Dungey. The 2-hour episode averaged 21 million viewers, 1.9 million more viewers than Grey's Anatomy's third season 19.1 million viewers-per-episode average at the time of its airing. The episode was also No. 1 in the 9pm and 10pm timeslots.[10] On May 5, 2007 it was announced, on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, that Private Practice was part of ABC's 2007 fall line-up.[11] The first TV promo for the series aired during the season finale of Grey's Anatomy, on May 17, 2007. The series premiere aired on September 26, 2007 averaging 14.41 million viewers being the most watched show in its time slot. The series premiered on British television on July 15, 2008, on LIVING. It was later moved to Thursday at 10:00pm after Grey's Anatomy during mid-season 2009, to make room for the return of Lost.On June 29, 2007 it was announced by ABC that Merrin Dungey, who played the role of Naomi Bennett, would be replaced by four time Tony winner Audra McDonald. ABC gave no reason for this change.[12] On July 11, 2007, it was announced that a new character, played by KaDee Strickland, had been added to the main cast.[13] Tony Award Winner Idina Menzel appeared in two episodes during the second season. Menzel is married to Private Practice star Taye Diggs. David Sutcliffe,[14] Jayne Brook,[15] and Josh Hopkins also appeared in Private Practice.Private Practice films a lot of their exterior shots (as well as some of their outdoor storylines) in Santa Monica, California. The Oceanside Group building can be found at the corner of 4th and Wilshire in Santa Monica, California. Addison Montgomery and Sam Bennett live in rare Malibu beachfront houses right on the sand, which in reality would cost upwards of $4 million each.[citation needed]The first season deals with Addison's move from Seattle to Los Angeles and her attempts to adjust to a very different type of working environment at Oceanside Wellness Group, a co-op private practice. The first season also deals with her budding relationships with her new co-workers. Among them include her best friend Naomi Bennett, a fertility specialist, and Naomi's ex-husband Sam Bennett, who specializes in internal medicine. Also working within the practice is psychiatrist Violet Turner, pediatrician Cooper Freedman, alternative medicine specialist Pete Wilder, and receptionist Dell Parker. It is revealed early on that the Bennetts established the practice with the rest of the doctors owning a share of it as well. Charlotte King, who serves as chief of staff at St. Ambrose Hospital, works with Oceanside Wellness through her dealings with Sam and her sexual relationship with Cooper.The second season dealt with the practice's financial troubles. Naomi reveals to Addison that they are in danger of losing the practice due to unpaid debt causing Addison to tell Sam. This in turn causes a shift within the practice making Addison the new boss. Adding to the drama was the competition of a new practice, Pacific Wellcare. This new practice, located within the same building as Oceanside Wellness, was run by Charlotte causing turmoil for her and Cooper. Another happening within this season is the dynamic between Sam and Naomi who by the finale realize they can no longer be friends as well as the deepening romantic relationship of Cooper and Charlotte. Addison was romantically linked with Kevin Nelson (played by David Sutcliffe), a police officer, but later realized their relationship was going nowhere. Towards the end of the season, Addison falls in love with cardiovascular surgeon Noah Barnes, who as it turns out, is married and is expecting his first child. Matters become more complicated when Addison realizes that Noah's wife is one of her patients. Archer Montgomery (Grant Show), Addison's playboy brother, also made sporadic appearances causing trouble for her and Naomi. Archer was found to be with an aggressive brain tumor which was later diagnosed as parasites. Addison sought the professional help of her ex-husband, neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). After Derek successfully saved Archer, Addison discovered Archer was back to his old tricks cheating on Naomi. Violet stirred some of her own drama when she began dating Sheldon (Brian Benben), who works for Pacific Wellcare, and Pete. During the latter half of the season, Violet was found to be pregnant although she did not know who the father of her baby was. Furthermore, Violet found herself and her unborn baby at the mercy of a psychotic patient bent on taking Violet's baby by any means necessary in the closing moments of the season finale Meanwhile, Dell struggled with his own issues caused by his former girlfriend's drug habits and the fight for custody of his daughter Betsey. Some of the medical cases that caused a stir and tension among the doctors at Private Practice was the issue of abortion (a first for the practice), the sex re-assignment of a newborn, the sexual activity of a 12-year old, the switching of embryos for two mothers-to-be and a young couple who later discovered they were siblings.In the third season, Violet survives the cliffhanger in season two while she gives her baby Lucas to Pete while she recovers from the ordeal. Addison and Sam get even closer but decide not to become a couple because they don't want to hurt Naomi, Charlotte and Cooper break up, and Dell loses Heather in an explosion which nearly kills Betsey also. Addison and Pete become a couple, which causes Addison to get close to Lucas until Violet wants him back even going as far as taking Pete to court to get joint custody. Sheldon starts to fall for Charlotte after they start to sleep together and Sam and Naomi's daughter, Maya, gets pregnant and marries the father of her baby, Dink. And Derek Shepherd's sister, Dr. Amelia Shepherd, arrives in town. In the season finale, Addison and Sam finally get together while Charlotte and Cooper get engaged much to Sheldon's dismay. Pete and Violet work over their issues, while Dell and Maya get involved in a car accident and the severity of Dell's condition is overlooked while Maya was being attended to in the operating room. Dr. Amelia Shepherd, younger sister of Derek Shepherd (Addison's ex-husband), operated on him but was unable to resuscitate following Dell's heart failure. Maya survived her operation to save her spinal cord and prevent paralysis while at the same time she gives birth to a girl, who also survives the ordeal.In the fourth season Brian Benben and Caterina Scorsone have been upgraded to series regulars. The season begins with the aftermath of Dell's death, including his funeral and what happens to his daughter Betsey. Violet and Pete get married in the season premiere and finally begin a new life with their son Lucas. Addison and Sam reveal their romance to the staff of Oceanside Wellness, which causes Naomi to leave town to learn to accept their new relationship. Cooper and Charlotte's relationship continues to get stronger as they get engaged. Charlotte is raped and badly beaten by one of the patients at her hospital and decides to only tell Addison and make her keep it a secret. Charlotte later decides she does not want to tell anyone she was raped, not even Cooper. Later everyone finds out but Charlotte won't identify Lee McHenry, her rapist. Later we find out Violet was raped while she was in college. Charlotte finally decides to identify Lee because Sheldon tells her to do so. She goes to the police station, but since she did not accuse him and because of the long history of Charlotte not telling, the lawyer does not accept to charge Lee, who is later stabbed by his girl friend in self-defense. She tells the authorities about almost getting killed, which finally leads to Lee's arrest, but before this, he is saved at the surgeon's slab with Charlotte granting the procedure in spite of her being victimized by him. In the season finale it was decided that they will close down Oceanside Wellness and open another practice; and Naomi decides it would be best to move to New York to be with Gabriel.On January 10, 2011, ABC renewed Private Practice for a fifth season.[16] It was announced on February 9, 2011, that Audra McDonald, who plays the character Naomi Bennett, will not return as a regular cast member in the fifth season of Private Practice, however said she may return as a guest star or a recurring character. Following the departure of Audra McDonald, it was announced on March 20, 2011 that actor Benjamin Bratt will be added to the series as a regular cast member for the fifth season of the show. The details of his character were released on August 7, as he is set to play Jake Reilly; a fertility specialist "who is quite accomplished and up to speed with cutting-edge technology and procedures." Season 5 focuses on Amelia, and her drug addiction, and the entire practice trying to save her life, ultimately deciding to have an intervention for her, and thus sending her to rehab. After rehab, Amelia finds out that she is pregnant by Ryan, a boyfriend who got her back into drugs and later died of an overdose. She finds out that the baby does not have a brain, but ultimately decides to take the baby to full term and donate the organs to save other children's lives. Later in the season, Cooper was revealed to have had an 8-year old son from a previous one night stand. The son, who's named Mason, is portrayed by child actor Griffin Gluck. While Gluck initially served as a guest star, he was promoted to series regular later on in the season. Gluck is notable for being the first child to be a series regular in Private Practice, or in the original series Grey's Anatomy. Mason's mother sought out Cooper after discovering that she was stricken with cancer, and she dies later in the season. Season 5 also deals with Addison not being able to have her own children, only to be able to adopt a child, Henry, just as Amelia's tragic news is given.On May 11, 2012, ABC officially renewed Private Practice for a sixth season.[2] On May 30, 2012, it was announced that Tim Daly, who plays Pete Wilder, would not be returning to the main cast in season six.[17] The sixth season premiered on September 25, 2012. In the sixth season premiere Violet finds out that Pete hasn't shown up for court and assumes that he ran off only to find out later that he had a heart attack jogging and died. Charlotte finds outs that she's pregnant but is happy because her IUD will most likely destroy the pregnancy, only to find out she's pregnant with triplets.Shortly after the May renewal, speculation arose that this would be the final season of the series. This appeared to be confirmed when Kate Walsh announced on June 12, 2012 that she will leave Private Practice after the thirteenth episode of season six.[18] Private Practice creator Shonda Rhimes confirmed on on October 19, 2012 that season six and the series will end with the thirteenth episode.[19]Private Practice initially received mixed reviews. Metacritic which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gave the show a score of 45 based on 25 critical reviews.[20] The first episode was somewhat panned by critics and The New York Times described the show's characters as "collectively offer[ing] one of the most depressing portrayals of the female condition since The Bell Jar."[21]To date, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment has released the first five seasons of Private Practice on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4. The series is also available for download on iTunes Store.Private Practice started airing in broadcast syndication on weekends beginning September 15, 2012.[citation needed]Private Practice at TV.com1 Cast and characters

The show centers on protagonist Jackson "Jax" Teller (Charlie Hunnam), the then-vice president of the club, who begins questioning the club and himself.Sons of Anarchy premiered on September 3, 2008, on cable network FX. The third season of the series attracted an average of 4.9 million viewers per week, making it FX's highest rated series ever, surpassing FX's other hits The Shield, Nip/Tuck, and Rescue Me. On February 3, 2012, Sons of Anarchy was renewed for two additional seasons, a fifth and a sixth. Those involved in the production of the series imply that a seventh and final season is creator Kurt Sutter's plan.[1]Sons of Anarchy is the story of the Teller-Morrow family of Charming, California, as well as the other members of Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original (SAMCRO), their families, various Charming townspeople, allies and rival gangs, associates, and law agencies that undermine or support SAMCRO's legal and illegal enterprises.The series was created by Kurt Sutter. Sutter is the showrunner, the series' most prolific writer, and a regular director. He has directed each season finale to date. Sutter had previously worked as an executive producer for the FX series The Shield. The series' other executive producers are father and son team Art Linson and John Linson. Jim Parriott served as an executive producer and writer for the first season only.Jack LoGiudice served as a consulting producer and regular writer for the first season. He became co-executive producer for the second season. He left the series to work on The Walking Dead. Dave Erickson also worked as a consulting producer for the first and second season and then took over as co-executive producer for the third season. The series other regular writers are supervising producer Chris Collins and co-producer Regina Corrado.Sutter drew regular directors from The Shield including Stephen Kay, Gwyneth Horder-Payton, Guy Ferland, and Billy Gierhart. Paris Barclay joined Sons of Anarchy as an executive producer for the fourth season, a role which saw him irregularly direct episodes.The Sons of Anarchy (SOA) is an outlaw motorcycle club with many chapters in the United States and overseas. The show focuses on the original and founding chapter, Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original,[8] referred to by the acronym SAMCRO[9] or Sam Crow. This nickname is also reflected in the original title of the show, Forever Sam Crow.[10] The Redwood chapter is headquartered in (the fictional town) Charming, California, in a clubhouse adjacent to the Teller-Morrow auto mechanic shop. Led by President Clay Morrow, and later Jax Teller, the club protects and controls Charming through close community relationships, bribery, and violent intimidation. In early seasons they are particularly vehement about keeping "hard" drugs, and drug dealers, out of Charming.John Teller and Piedmont "Piney" Winston co-founded SAMCRO in 1967 following their return from the Vietnam War, where both men served as paratroopers.[11] The first chapter was called "Redwood" because they weren't settled in any one city but just cruised the Northern California coast from Eureka to Big Sur, which is Redwood country. After Gemma, John's wife, became pregnant with her first son, Jackson (Jax), they decided to settle in Charming, the town where Gemma grew up. At that point, John Teller thought Charming was too cute for a chapter name, so he called the chapter the Redwood Originals, hence the SAMCRO handle. Six of the "Redwood Original 9" members were veterans. When John died in 1993 his widow, Gemma, married Clay Morrow the youngest founding member. John and Gemma's son, Jax, grew up around the club and became President of SAMCRO.Club members wear vests known as kuttes (jackets with the sleeves cut off). The SOA patch on the back is a Grim Reaper holding a crystal ball with the anarchy "A", and wielding the Reaper's traditional scythe, the handle of which has been replaced by the M16 rifle that the club's founders wielded in Vietnam. Only full members can wear the "patch". Other, smaller patches on the vest have specific meanings, such as "Men of Mayhem", which is worn by club members who have spilled blood on the club's behalf, and "First 9", worn by the original nine SOA members.The Sons ride customized Harley-Davidson motorcycles of various types, mostly Dyna Super Glide Sports (a short-lived model that included a fairing and a blacked out TC88 engine) although Bobby Elvis, in one scene, rode an old Harley Fat Boy which had seen better days. Each rider customizes his own bike to his individual style; however, they all paint their bikes black and most sport drag bar style handlebars. A patchholder's bike usually sports the Sons of Anarchy letters on it somewhere, the club's Grim Reaper logo, or the circled "A" club logo. Prospects are not permitted to paint their bikes black until they get patched in.Club members have "day jobs" in local industries; most work at the Teller-Morrow garage as mechanics, but they primarily make money by illegally importing weapons, modifying and selling them to various gangs, and making protection runs for local businesses by defending valuable truck shipments against hijacking.The club operates out of a clubhouse located on the same lot as the Teller-Morrow auto shop. The clubhouse includes a living area with multiple rooms (where members sometimes crash for the night), a fully operational bar, a pool table, a kitchen, a workout room, and the "chapel", a room with an elaborate redwood conference table that has a reaper logo carved into the top, where the patched members meet to discuss club business and vote on major decisions. The club also owns a secluded cabin in the woods and a warehouse outside of town (which was bought from but is still maintained by club associate Elliot Oswald), where they store weapons and cocaine for the Galindo Cartel.See List of gangs from Sons of AnarchySAMCRO keeps meth traffickers and drug dealers out of Charming, which puts them at odds with the meth-distributing white supremacist Nordics (aka Nords), headed by Ernest Darby. This earns them respect and admiration from the townspeople, who believe the Sons do more to protect their town than its own police. SAMCRO also has to deal with a rival, Oakland-based motorcycle club (MC), the Mayans led by Marcus Alvarez (who also features in The Shield season 2, episode 2). Other groups in SAMCRO's orbit include the San Franciscobased Chinese mafia Lin Triad, led by Henry Lin; the Italian American Cacuzza crime family; the Real IRA (aka RIRA) of Ireland, which supplies them with illegal Russian-made guns; the "One-Niners", an African American street gang (who also appeared on The Shield, thus possibly putting the two in the same fictional universe) to whom SAMCRO sell weapons; and various affiliates in the state prison system, where many members of the club have been incarcerated at one time or another..Sutter has said of the Shakespeare element, "I don't want to overplay that but it's there. It was Jax's father who started the club, so he's the ghost in the action. You wonder what he would have made of the way it turned out. It's not a version of Hamlet but it's definitely influenced by it."[12] Ron Perlman believes "theyre going to stick to the structure of Hamlet all the way to the end (of the series)."[13] The two final episodes of season 4 are titled: "To Be" (Parts I and II).The series begins with the torching of a SAMCRO gun-assembly warehouse and the theft of guns by a rival club, the Mayans. The police attend the scene where a cop, who is on the SAMCRO payroll, finds two dead illegal immigrants. Meanwhile, Jax's estranged meth-addicted wife Wendy, who is pregnant with his child, collapses. An emergency C-section is performed and the baby is delivered ten weeks prematurely.Jax struggles with the direction the club is taking. Gemma tells Wendy that if she tries to gain custody of the child, Abel, that she will kill Wendy, and Gemma supplies her with drugs which Wendy eventually takes and overdoses on. Charming Deputy Chief Hale finds the immigrants' bodies at the burnt-out warehouse, but Tig and Bobby remove them before he can forensically examine them. Tara receives a threatening phone call from a former boyfriend, ATF agent, Josh Kohn, who comes to Charming stalking Tara, pretending to investigate the Sons but apparently on vacation status.To solve a gun-trafficking problem under the ATF's watchful eye, the Sons head out to Indian Hills, Nevada, to patch over the Devil's Tribe Motorcycle Club. While there, Clay sleeps with a girl named Cherry, who also takes a liking to Half Sack. Kohn follows the Sons and witnesses their shootout with the Mayans. Kohn provides Tara pictures of Jax in compromising situations to try to split the two. The Sons soon become aware of Kohn's presence in Charming. Clay is arrested on charges of aiding and abetting a triple homicide after guns the Sons sold were used in a shootout. Cherry arrives in Charming, and Gemma realizes that Clay has slept with her. Shortly afterward, Gemma assaults her with a skateboard, for which she is arrested.Tara reveals to Jax that Kohn has been stalking her since she broke up with him, and that she has a restraining order against him. Jax throws Kohn through a window before beating him and telling him to stay away from Tara. Kohn is arrested for breaking his restraining order, which ends Kohn's career as a federal agent. Kohn returns to Tara's house and attempts to rape her, but Tara is able to grab his gun and shoots him in the stomach. Jax comes to her aid and advises Tara to let the police handle the situation. When Kohn calls Tara a "biker slut", Jax shoots him in the head. Jax takes Kohn's body to the hills and later returns to burn it. He also throws his father's memoir into the fire, but takes it back out within seconds.Opie botches a planned assassination that was a favor for the IRA, and Bobby steps in to complete the task. However, their crime is witnessed by the victim's 17 year old black mistress. ATF Agent June Stahl tries to crack the club's unity by interrogating the women associated with the club: Tara, Luann, Donna, and Cherry. Stahl arrests Cherry on outstanding warrants, but Charming Police Chief Wayne Unser aids Cherry, who escapes Charming that night. When Big Otto learns that Stahl is trying to use the RICO Act to bring the club down for racketeering, he violently assaults Stahl. The young girl who witnessed Bobby commit murder provides the ATF with sketches of Bobby and Opie, who are subsequently arrested. Stahl sets up Opie to look like a rat, even though she knows it endangers his life, and Tig and Clay fall for the ploy. They believe Opie has turned informant when they find wire taps in Opie's phone and truck. Clay orders Tig to kill Opie without telling anyone else in the club; however, Tig accidentally kills Donna when she is driving Opie's truck.Clay and Tig set up the shooting to look like the One-Niners shot Donna. However, feeling guilty, Deputy Hale tells Jax that Stahl set up Opie. Jax subsequently realizes that Clay organized the shooting.Tig, Happy, and Chibs find the witness to prevent her from testifying. Tig is about to kill her, but Jax has followed them and confronts Tig, putting a gun to his head. Tig then decides not to kill the witness. Jax threatens her and gives her enough money to leave California. Jax is clearly unhappy remaining under Clay's rule, as he sees Clay as immoral and taking the club from its roots.The season opens with the arrival of a new threat in Charming, white separatists called the League Of American Nationalists (LOAN).[14] LOAN's leader and backer businessman Ethan Zobelle and Zobelle's enforcer, A.J. Weston, seek to drive the Sons of Anarchy from Charming. To send a message to SAMCRO, Zobelle has Gemma kidnapped and gang raped by Weston and two others. Zobelle's own daughter, Polly, lures Gemma into this trap. Gemma chooses to keep silent about her rape to prevent her husband and son from retaliating.From prison, Big Otto reaches out to SAMCRO, asking them to help his wife, Luann, and her pornography studio after a raid from law enforcement and intimidation from a rival pornographer, Georgie Caruso, threaten her business. Jax proposes that SAMCRO become partners in Luanns porn business and offer protection to her and her performers, a move he hopes will raise money for the club legitimately while they rebuild their other revenue streams.Opie, struggling to deal with Donnas death, throws himself fully into the MC and, consequently, becomes increasingly distant from his children. Fueled by SAMCROs role in Donnas death, the rift between Clay and Jax continues to widen, with Jax challenging most of Clay's decisions. When a LOAN car bomb nearly kills Chibs, Clay demands immediate retaliation. But retaliation was what LOAN wanted, and Clay, Jax, Bobby, Tig, Juice, and Happy are arrested by the San Joaquin sheriffs in a botched attempt to attack Ethan Zobelle. While in jail, ATF Agent Stahl returns in an attempt to get SAMCRO to rat out their IRA connections. Although they do not give up the IRA, Stahl succeeds in provoking Clay and Jax into a physical confrontation in jail.Out on bail, the divisions in the club only worsen. The tension between Jax and Clay reaches a breaking point when the porn studio burns down shortly after Clay announces he wants SAMCRO out of the porn business. Jax initially believes that Clay had the place torched and announces that he is going "Nomad". Most of the SAMCRO members are upset with Jax's decision but ultimately vote in favor of his going Nomad. In order to convince Jax to stay, Gemma tells Jax and Clay about Weston's raping her, which reunites Clay and Jax.The club, however, nearly falls when Tig, overcome with guilt, confesses to Opie that he murdered Donna because Agent Stahl and the ATF had made it look as though Opie had become a rat. At the same time, Chibs agrees to help Stahl take down the IRA and its head, Jimmy O, who is in town to repair the IRA's relationship with SAMCRO. Based on information supplied by Chibs, the ATF is able to apprehend Edmond Hayes, whom they then want to use to apprehend his father, Cameron, and Jimmy O. Opie later witnesses Chibs leaving a meeting with the ATF and informs the club of what he saw but asks them to confront Chibs before acting. Chibs, already having doubts about becoming an informant, reveals to the club what he did.Meanwhile, the Sons learn that Ethan Zobelle's true intentions are not racially motivated; rather, he wants to do business with the Mayans on the prison heroin trade. The MC is able to exploit this information when they reveal it to AJ Weston, who is deeply committed to his racial beliefs and will not tolerate doing business with the Hispanic Mayans. This causes a split between AJ and Zobelle.Weston is soon arrested in connection with the fire at Luann's porn studio. Later, Hale arrives at Impeccable Smokes as the Sons are confronting Zobelle. In an attempt to save his and his daughter's lives, Zobelle informs the police that he is in possession of narcotics and is arrested. However, both are released from custody and Unser learns that Zobelle, unbeknownst to both the ATF and Weston, has actually been an FBI informant for the past three years. With the loss of Weston's support, Zobelle turns to the Mayans for protection.Weston, however, is on his own. Jax and others discover him in a tattoo parlor with his son. They instruct the tattoo artist to jab Weston so that Weston must wash the cut in the bathroom. Jax is waiting in the bathroom for Weston, but Weston has his young son with him. Weston sends his son away with instructions never to tell the police anything. Then, he sits on the toilet, resigned to his fate, and Jax shoots him several times.Agent Stahl continues to hold Edmond Hayes, in an attempt to use Edmond to lure and arrest his father. Out of loyalty to his father, Edmond attempts to kill Stahl, who shoots him when he tries to escape. Shortly afterward, Ethan's daughter Polly, who had been having an affair with Edmond, arrives at the safe house. She has been followed there by Gemma, who then shoots her. Stahl witnesses the shooting and lets Gemma escape but then proceeds to frame her for Edmond's shooting. Falling for the frame and becoming emotionally distraught, Cameron breaks into Jax's home and stabs Half Sack before threatening Tara and kidnapping Abel.Meanwhile, the rest of the Sons have ambushed Zobelle and the Mayans, forcing the Mayans to retreat, while Zobelle flees on his own. The Sons follow Zobelle, who stays in public places, knowing the Sons will not attack him in the open. Zobelle calls Hale for help, but is ignored. After a strange call from Tara, Jax returns to his home, where he discovers Half Sack's body and finds Tara tied up; she tells Jax that Cameron has taken Abel. Jax calls Clay, who returns to help track down Cameron without killing Zobelle. The Sons pursue Cameron, who makes his way to the docks, where he takes Abel and boards his boat. Chief Unser, after receiving a phone call from Gemma, is last seen driving in his police cruiser with her past Charming's city limits, apparently running off with her. Ethan Zobelle is seen quickly getting on a chartered plane back to Budapest without his dead daughter, Polly. The season ends with the Sons' arriving just as Cameron is leaving the docks.Days later, Gemma is hiding up north in Rogue River, Oregon with Tig, while the club tries to sort things out in Charming. The club tries to close in on Cameron's trail, but find that he has liquidated his assets and apparently fled the country. Gemma and Tig visit Gemma's father Nate (Hal Holbrook), who suffers from dementia. At the end of Half Sack's wake, masked men commit a drive-by shooting and fatally run down Deputy Hale.Having fled to Belfast with Abel, Cameron confesses his sins to his cousin Father Ashby, an intermediary between Jimmy O and the True IRA Council. Ashby subsequently has Cameron killed, and suggests he will give Abel up for adoption.The Sons hire a bounty hunter to try to track down Abel, and they believe he and Cameron are in Vancouver. SAMCRO has an upcoming bail hearing for the weapons charges, but they agree to jump bail. SAMCRO receives an email showing Cameron dead in Belfast.After Jax consults Jimmy O, SAMCRO believes Abel remained in Vancouver when Cameron left for Belfast. Gemma struggles when she takes Nate to his new assisted living home, and returns to Charming to reunite with her grandson, still unaware he has been kidnapped. Father Ashby's sister Maureen contacts Gemma, at Ashby's request, to tell her Abel is safe in Belfast. Upon learning of her grandson's abduction, Gemma suffers an arrhythmia and collapses in the Teller-Morrow lot. Tara confides in Gemma that she is six weeks pregnant with Jax's child. Jax makes a deal with Stahl behind SAMCRO's back. In exchange for his mother's freedom and the downgrade of the pending weapons charges against the club, Jax will deliver Jimmy O and his IRA contacts. Oswald agrees to smuggle the Sons to Belfast. Jax breaks up with Tara and the next morning, Tara walks in on Jax in bed with pornstar Ima.The recently ousted and humiliated former president of the Calaveras MC, Hector Salazar, begins surveilling Jax and Tara. After discovering John Teller had an affair in Belfast that produced a daughter, Gemma escapes from police custody with the help of Tara and Tara's boss, Margaret. Tara and Lyla both make appointments at an abortion clinic. Gemma leaves with SAMCRO on their trip to Belfast to find Abel, where Jimmy O already anticipates their arrival.On SAMCRO's arrival in Ireland, Ashby tells Jax that the IRA are tired of Jimmy's profiteering ways, and suggests Jax kill him in exchange for Abel.Stahl helps Jax uncover information on Ashby and SAMBEL, and warns Jax not to kill Jimmy O. SAMCRO plans to surprise Jimmy O on a protection run, but he is forewarned and attacks the Sons with a planted bomb that kills several SAMBEL members. SAMCRO tortures Liam until he reveals that he was privy to Jimmy O's plans, as was McGee. Jax kills Liam, and shortly afterward Clay pushes McGee from a rooftop; both are revealed to SAMBEL as traitors. Ashby tells Jax Abel's location, but suggests Jax allow him to be adopted so he will not be forced into the club life. Jax chooses to leave the child with the family, until Jimmy O kills the adoptive parents and abducts Abel, intending to exchange him for safe passage to America. Abel is returned to Jax after Ashby trades himself for the baby.Jacob Hale, Jr. uses intimidation tactics to continue urban development in Charming. Salazar abducts Tara and Margaret on their way to the abortion clinic. He informs Piney that he will return them in exchange for the murder of Alvarez and $250,000.Under the influence of Jacob Hale, Jr., the San Joaquin Sheriff's Department will soon take control of the Charming Police Department. Tara attacks Salazar's girlfriend and negotiates Margaret's freedom. Later, Salazar's girlfriend dies.With the hearing for weapons charges looming, SAMCRO returns to Charming, with the task of finding Tara. Gemma threatens to reveal Stahl's murder of Edmond unless Stahl ends her dealings with Jax. Salazar takes Jacob Hale, Jr. hostage along with Tara. Unser indicates the need for Salazar to be captured alive to implicate Hale and save the Charming Police Department, but during a stand-off, Jax kills Salazar. Amidst the chaos, Stahl intentionally shoots her partner Tyler to protect her lie. Opie proposes to Lyla. Now in the USA, Jimmy O seeks the help of the Russian Mafia to aid his escape to South America. Stahl falsely tells Internal Affairs that Agent Tyler shot Edmond and framed Gemma, admitting that Gemma was wrongfully charged.Jax and the Sons meet the Russians and pay $2 million for the exchange of Jimmy O, although most of the money is counterfeit. Jax tells Stahl the location of the exchange so she can intervene and arrest Jimmy, but Jimmy is moved to a different location before she can. Jax assures her that he will give her Jimmy if she reduces their prison sentence, to which she agrees. Stahl arrives at the clubhouse to arrest Jimmy. When Clay asks how she knew he was there, Stahl indicates that Jax is a rat, which outrages the club, whose members call Jax a "dead man". SAMCRO is arrested and loaded into an ATF van, with Jax isolated from the other club members.Unser stops Stahl on the roadside as she transports Jimmy and warns her of an IRA threat further down the road. Her fellow agents leave to investigate, leaving her alone with Unser and Jimmy. Soon afterward, Piney, Chibs, Opie and Kozik arrive. Chibs gives Jimmy a Glasgow smile, and then kills him. Opie kills Stahl in a similar fashion, after reminding her that she was responsible for Donna's death. Proof of Jax's dealings with Stahl is destroyed, leaving the club with the documents provided by Stahl to reduce their sentence. The scene is set to look like the IRA is responsible. In the ATF van, Jax learns of Stahl and Jimmy's demise as the prospects following the ATF van ride past and beep a Morse code signal "A-F-F-A" ("Angels Forever, Forever Angels", a tribute to Sonny Barger, who plays Lenny the Pimp). He smiles, as do the rest of SAMCRO, revealing the club knew of Jax's plan from the beginning. Tara, meanwhile, finds and reads the letters Maureen had put in Jax's bag. In them, John Teller writes to Mo of his awareness of Gemma and Clay's closeness and his fear that they will soon murder him. The season ends with Jax rejecting his father's original vision for SAMCRO and embracing Clay's rule.The imprisoned SAMCRO members leave the penitentiary after their 14-month stay and are welcomed home by Lieutenant Eli Roosevelt of the San Joaquin Sheriffs' Department, the new law enforcement presence in Charming. He forbids any paroled members from wearing club cuts in his jurisdiction, declaring them to be a form of gang association. To Clay's displeasure, the club learns that Jacob Hale has fostered the construction of a new suburban development, Charming Heights.U.S. Attorney Lincoln Potter seeks Lieutenant Roosevelt's help to build a RICO case against SAMCRO. On the eve of Opie's wedding, Jax proposes to Tara, who accepts when Jax explains that he plans to leave the club. The Sons prepare to trade guns with the Russians, using the guise of Opie's wedding as a cover to avoid the law. In retaliation for an attack on Jax in prison, SAMCRO betrays the Russians and murders several of the group  including an undercover agent working with Potter.After Gemma finds one of Maureen's notes in Tara's belongings, she questions Clay about Jax and Tara's allegiance to the club. Eventually, she asks Tara about the notes, and Tara openly denies knowledge of their existence.Jax and Clay meet with Alvarez and Galindo cartel member Romero "Romeo" Parada (Danny Trejo) to negotiate gun trafficking. To Jax's surprise, Clay agrees to mule cocaine for the cartel in exchange for cash and protection from the Russians. Jax realizes that Clay is taking risks in order to stockpile money for when he leaves the club. Jax makes a private deal with Clay, wherein he agrees to the trafficking on the condition that when Clay leaves, he does also, and Opie becomes president. The rest of SAMCRO is split on the decision to mule cocaine. After much discussion, the vote passes 65, but causes a schism in the club.As SAMCRO makes their first gun run for the cartel, Clay's arthritis worsens. Gemma warns Piney against digging up the past with Tara. Potter continues to stir up trouble with the club, informing Otto that Bobby was sleeping with Luanne prior to her death.As the search for the letters continues, it is confirmed that Clay had Jax's father murdered to stop him from ending the gun running arrangement with the IRA. Unser and Gemma are also complicit in that they either knew and/or covered up the "accident".Eventually, Juice's paranoia about the club's knowing his African American origins grows to the point that he makes more contacts with Roosevelt, who makes it clear he needs a sample of the cocaine load if he wants protection. Juice successfully steals one brick, but he falls asleep before he can take a sample and return the brick, so he must hide it before being discovered. The club learns about the missing cocaine, which causes an internal conflict between SAMCRO and the Mayans, forcing both clubs to test their members to see if they are guilty of stealing the brick. Phil and Ratboy, two of SAMCRO's prospects, fall under suspicion and are subjected to Russian Roulette and other tests of their commitment to the club. Juice, feeling guilty that the prospects are suffering for his mistake, tries to retrieve the brick he stole, but Miles catches him. When Miles tries to take Juice back to the warehouse to reveal the theft, the two fight, and Juice shoots and kills Miles, framing him for the missing drugs.Romeo arrives at the warehouse and verifies the successful delivery of the cocaine. Clay asks Romeo for help to kill Tara to keep his secret of John Teller's murder hidden, telling Romeo only that the doctor has information that could compromise their business.As the club goes to one of Alvarez's drug laboratories to inspect the operation, they are ambushed and shot by a crew who kills several Mayans and wounds Alvarez. Jax gives chase and learns that the attackers were from the Lobos Sonora cartel, the rivals of the Galindo Cartel. The escalating violence gives SAMCRO members second thoughts, especially Bobby, who calls a vote for a new president and nominates himself. Clay angrily agrees. That night, Juice attempts suicide by hanging himself in a tree, but the branch breaks and he fails.The following day, the vote for the new president begins with Clay and Tig voting against Bobby, but the vote is interrupted by an attack by the Lobos Sonora on the garage and clubhouse. They manage to catch one of the attackers who, under questioning with truth serum, reveals a possible traitor in the Mayan ranks. The club plans to use the traitor to send false information to the Lobos Sonora, luring them into an ambush. When the plan fails, SAMCRO finds a truck with the beheaded bodies of Mayans and the SAMTAZ President, Armando, raising tensions over the drug muling even higher.Jax confronts Piney about his relationship with Clay, confirming once more that he will not follow in his father's footsteps. Feeling cornered by Piney's threat to show the letters to the club, Clay visits Piney at the cabin demanding the letters. When Piney refuses, Clay appears to leave, only to burst back through the door and shoot Piney with his own shotgun, killing him. In an attempt to implicate the Lobos Sonora for the killing, Clay paints in Piney's blood the initials LS on a photo of the First 9.The club receives information from the Galindo Cartel that suggests the One-Niners are working with the Lobos Sonora, while Clay sets a meeting between the Irish Kings and Galindo for new, high-powered weaponry. The club decides to arrange a meeting with Laroy of the One-Niners, at which the Galindo Cartel appears and a brief fight ensues, but they instead use Laroy as a way to drag the Lobos Sonora's men into a trap. This fails, however, as the Lobos Sonora cartel members are equipped with destructive explosive weaponry, which they use to escape. When Galindo cartel member Luis wants to kill the Niners, Jax manages to save them by having them side with them[according to whom?]. At the same time, Luis gives Clay a cellphone for his contact to kill Tara, but Gemma convinces Clay otherwise and Unser plans to use the blame Clay put on the Lobos Sonora for a new plan. Gemma talks with Tara, who tells Gemma that the letters would put Jax deeper into the club out of guilt, so she won't show them to him. Juice is cornered by Lincoln Potter, who seemingly persuades Otto after knowing that Georgie had an alibi and that Bobby lied to him, letting him know that they have more than enough proof to potentially arrest every charter of the club, but that he wants the RIRA.Jax confronts Clay about letting Bobby know he wants to quit the club and for promising him the Presidency over Opie, as was the deal. Clay blames Jax's changes on Tara, and Jax warns him to never insult Tara again. This leads to a talk with Gemma, who assures Clay that Tara won't let Jax read the letters and makes him promise not to hurt Tara. However, Clay later uses the cellphone Luis gave him to contract the hit on Tara. The next morning, Clay takes $25,000 of personal savings to pay the contract to kill Tara, unaware that Jax was going to escort Tara, Abel and Thomas. When he learns this, Clay desperately tries to call back the hit, but is unsuccessful, and Tara is nearly abducted and receives a severe injury to her right hand, that Tara believes is permanent. Clay meets Romeo and tries to end the hit but Romeo is convinced that Tara is better off dead, to which Clay reluctantly agrees.The club and the Mayans go meet Laroy to contact the Lobos Sonora; however, due to the murders of 3 One-Niners, Laroy's men gun down a Mayan for being Mexican. This sparks a brief but intense fight that is stopped by Laroy, who demands both clubs leave. Jax tells Opie that he wants to quit the club, which shocks him. Opie tries to convince Jax to stay, but Jax tells Opie to fix his life with Lyla and talk to Piney. Juice is further cornered by Lincoln Potter into informing him of the meeting or risk the RICO act, leaving Roosevelt disgusted with Lincoln.Gemma is horrified by what Clay has done and confronts him, further angering Clay, who demands her to stop. However, Gemma threatens to tell the truth and aims a gun at Clay, which ends in a fight in which Clay is injured and Gemma's face is severely beaten, prompting Clay to sleep at the clubhouse that night. Gemma calls Unser who, given what Clay has done, wants to report him to the authorities, but Gemma tells Unser that Clay is beyond salvation and as such "he will die by the hands of a Son."The following morning, the club meets with the Galindo cartel to prepare the weapons for the battle against the Lobos Sonoras' settlement in California. The club and the Galindo cartel are able to ambush 3 members, who reveal the main camp's location; however, they are faced with landmines and a shootout ensues, with Kozik getting blown up when he steps on a mine. The club kills most of the remaining Sonoras using RPGs.Wendy, who was gone for rehabilitation, is back and proclaims to both Tara and Gemma that even though she gave up custody, she wants to get closer to Abel. Otto strikes a deal with Lincoln Potter for information; among the benefits, First-Niner Lenny the Pimp is allowed visitations in exchange for criminal information. The club finds from Oswald that the Katsuki Family, Georgie's Asian investors, had met with Jacob Hale beforehand and are willing to invest in Charming Heights. Bobby, Opie, and Tig confront Georgie about this and, under threat, he confesses that he sent men to attack Luann but her death was unexpected. As a result, Georgie is killed.Seeing Gemma's beaten face, Tig shows his disgust towards Clay and gives Clay his "Sergeant-at-Arms" patch, resigning his position. With Unser following, Opie goes to visit Piney, only to find his father dead. Opie confronts Unser, who tells Opie the truth about Clay, further shocking him and driving him over the edge.A meeting takes place between the club and the Irish kings. The IRA express their discomfort with Jax's decision to use RPGs to rescue Clay during the fight with the Lobos Sonora. They eventually agree to consider the continual sale of heavy weapons, provided the club does them a local service. Meanwhile, Romeo and Clay meet to address the concerns of the Irish regarding their liability should the heavy weapons be used north of the border. Jax, Clay, and Bobby discuss Jax's future with the club, agreeing that Bobby should get the Presidency, Chibs the V.P., and Happy a promotion to Sergeant-at-Arms. Bobby heads out to inform Otto that Georgie has been finally killed, and he is escorted to an empty receiving room to wait for Otto.Jax leaves to check in on Tara, only to discover that Wendy has returned to see Abel and Gemma is trying handle it behind Jax's back. Unser has the local mortician from season one remove Piney's body and bring it to the mortuary for an "after-hours" cremation. Juice is again picked up by law-enforcement, but this time it is official ATF. Jax, Chibs, Tig, and Happy agree to escort one of the "Irish Kings" to sort out an issue at another one of their American businesses. While there, Jax discovers it is another Irish "baby-factory" similar to the one that Abel was almost adopted from in Ireland in season three. Jax starts a small riot at the adoption house, leading the Irish King Leland to question his decision making process with Clay.Jax confronts Wendy, who is still intent on seeing Abel and threatens to see a judge if Jax refuses. When Wendy ends her argument with, "I'm not going anywhere", Jax responds, "I am". Clay proceeds to visit Tara alone in the hospital, where he reveals to Tara that he knows about the letters. He offers a trade, which would allow her, her family, and Jax leave Charming, but threatens her if she doesn't relinquish the letters. On his way out, Clay bumps into Gemma, who alerts him that Opie knows about his father's murder and will soon be coming after Clay. She ends their encounter with a kiss on the cheek, suggesting that she is saying "goodbye" to Clay. Jax then arrives to sort things out between Tara and Gemma, letting Gemma know his plans for leaving. Jax leaves after receiving a mysterious phone call, which we learn is to go meet Opie at the mortuary.Otto has finally worked out all of the arrangements in his deal to turn state's evidence and signs the deal. He then sits down with Bobby and reveals his betrayal, as law enforcement leads Bobby out in handcuffs. Bobby is taken to a cell, and we see that Juice is being held in an adjoining cell, biding his time until the RICO sting goes down. Bobby does not notice Juice. Upon arriving at the mortuary, Jax sees Opie, Unser, and a coffin in the crematorium. Unser's intention is to talk to Opie, as requested by Gemma, and tell him there was a mistake and it was not Clay who killed his father. However, Unser does not get the opportunity to talk to Opie and leaves Jax and Opie together in the crematorium. Jax attempts to console an unresponsive Opie, who is holding his father's kutte, which he eventually throws into the flames to burn with his father's remains. After the cremation, Jax walks outside to find out how Piney died, only to have Opie pull a gun on him and divulge that Clay was responsible. Jax suggests that this is an issue for the club to decide; Opie responds by shooting out the tire on Jax's bike. Opie then takes off to confront Clay, with Jax trying to catch up. At the clubhouse, a fearful Clay lies in wait. Opie jumps Clay and confronts him with his father's death, forcing him to sit at the head of the table, stating he'll "die at the gavel". Jax rushes in with his gun pointed at Opie, threatening to kill Opie if he doesn't lower his gun. However, Opie opens fire anyway and hits Clay twice in the chest.Clay is still alive and makes a gasping sound. Opie raises his gun to shoot him again but Jax shoots him in the wrist. Unser and one of the prospects hear the gunshots and come running. They move Clay outside and call the police. Jax tells Opie to go hide out in the cabin until he sorts things out. They leave Unser to tell the police and the rest of the gang that Clay was shot by two black men driving a SUV. Clay is taken to the hospital, where he goes into surgery. Jax drives out to Stockton, where he meets with Lenny "The Pimp", who heard Otto has made a deal with law enforcement. Meanwhile, Tig blames himself for not being there when Clay was shot, and goes after the Niners for revenge. He tries to run over Laroy, but kills the girl who is with Laroy. The Niners chase Tig until Jax and SAMCRO come to save him.Afterward, Jax meets with the Galindo cartel and tells them about Otto. Romero checks with his people and tells Jax if Otto were snitching, he would have found out, so the meeting with the Irish is still on.Gemma goes to Tara and tells her the truth about Clay. She convinces Tara to give her the letters so Gemma can give them to Clay in exchange for Tara's safety. Gemma gets the letters and removes those that implicate her and Unser in the death of John Teller. She takes the remaining letters to Jax, and urges him to kill Clay and take his rightful place at the head of the club. While Jax reads the letters, Gemma waits outside the clubhouse with Unser and tells him what she did, while Tara drives up and asks to speak with Gemma alone. Tara asks Gemma if she gave the letters to Clay and Gemma stays quiet. Tara reveals she knows about Gemma's plan claiming, "I'm smarter than you and I know Jax better." At this point Jax comes over and tells Tara that he is going to kill Clay. Tara says she knows, pulls a needle with blood thinner out of her bag, and tells Jax to inject Clay with it and pull out his chest tube, so it will look like an accident. She tells him to get out of Charming after killing Clay, which he agrees with. Jax leaves, and Gemma asks Tara what she thinks she is doing. Tara replies, "What you taught me. He's [Jax] mine." Gemma is visibly angered.As Lincoln Potter is ready to move on his RICO operation, he's called off by Romero Parada and Luis Torres, who are revealed to be CIA agents, whom the government allows to run their cartel so as long as they bring others down for political reasons. During the meeting, the Irish King Galaan, makes it clear he does not trust Jax and will only deal with Clay. Romero and Luis talk with Jax, reveal their secret of being CIA agents, and instruct him not to reveal it to anybody; they advise they need SAMCRO to run the drugs and weapon supply, otherwise they will allow the RICO operation and crush SAMCRO. Jax visits Clay at the hospital, finally making clear that he read the letters. He does not kill Clay, as he's needed alive to deal with Galaan, but he does, however strip him of his position of President and orders him to stay away from Tara and Gemma. Demoted to the status of an unseated member, Clay agrees, knowing that Jax will not listen to his explanation.Following the halt on the RICO operation, Lincoln Potter gives Roosevelt a clean record for Juice for him to give him, seemingly parting ways. Potter bursts into the meeting for Charming Heights, revealing the true colors of Jacob Hale's investors, whom Hale masked as Tokyo Fund but are actually the Natsuki Family, who are heavily involved in sex deals, including pedophilia. This puts a recess on the vote.Deputy Chief Cane reveals that Laroy's girlfriend, whom Tig killed, is the daughter of Damon Pope, the most powerful gangster in Oakland (hinting a possible retaliation). Jax meets with Opie and confirms his suspicions, but warns Opie they need Clay alive (not revealing all details of the CIA's threat), and asks him to be his Vice President. Opie, still distrustful, does not give a clear answer. Jax returns home to Tara and tells her the truth about the CIA-backed cartel dealings and that he must remain as club president while she leaves with the boys. Jax appears at the chapel and announces himself as President, with his first act to name Chibs as his new Sergeant-at-Arms, which Chibs gladly accepts. Happy, Tig and Juice enter the chapel, with Juice finally free of his African-American record. The meeting starts at 8:03 pm with Opie's not showing (it is unknown if he later does). Tara enters the chapel, claiming to Jax that she will also remain in Charming, just as Gemma enters. Tara stands behind Jax in his President seat, mirroring a photo of Gemma and John Teller in the same positions.Season 5 premiered on September 11, 2012.[15] On his Sons of Anarchy YouTube channel Sutterinksoa, Kurt Sutter has stated that he began writing scripts for season 5, episodes one and two as early as March 1, 2012. It was also announced that Chuck Zito would be joining the Sons cast as a nomad traveling through Charming.[16] Another announced cast addition for season five is Jimmy Smits. Smits, known for his work in L.A. Law, NYPD Blue, The West Wing, and Dexter, will play an escort service owner and former Latino gang member who becomes a mentor to Jax.[17] Harold Perrineau joined the cast in May as the villain Damon Pope.[18] The premiere episode is titled "Sovereign" and episode 5.2 is "Authority Vested".Although Sons of Anarchy is set in Northern California's Central Valley, it is filmed primarily at Occidental Studios Stage 5A in North Hollywood. Main sets located there include the clubhouse, St. Thomas Hospital and Jax's house. The production rooms at the studio used by the writing staff also double as the Charming police station. External scenes are often filmed nearby in Sun Valley and Tujunga.[19] Internal and external scenes set in Ireland during season 3 were also filmed at Occidental Studios and surrounding areas. A second production unit shot footage in Ireland used in the third season.[20]Sons of Anarchy has received generally favorable reviews over the course of its run, with many singling out Katey Sagal's performance. On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season scored 68/100, the second season scored 86/100, the third season scored 84/100 and the fourth season scored 81/100.[21][22][23][24]The first season received mixed reviews from industry critics. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said the first season had real potential.[25]The New York Times Gina Bellafante spoke highly of the cast's acting ability, particularly Sagals portrayal of Gemma. Brian Lowry of Variety gave a mixed review, admiring Sutters creation of the club and the town of Charming but observing the early episodes lacked direction.[26]The second season saw a notable increase in positive reviews, and was the series' most critically acclaimed season. Writing for Chicago Tribune, Maureen Ryan called the second season engrossing. She elaborated that the pacing is better [and] the plotting is tighter and commends Sagal and Perlman for their performances.[27] Varietys Stuart Levine stated that the new season was compelling; he also complimented the acting skill of Perlman, Sagal, Hunnam and Siff.[28] James Poniewozik of TIME called Sagal's performance "devastatingly powerful" and named the series on his list of Top 10 Shows of 2009.[29]Some critics felt the third season was dragged down by the previous season's cliffhanger.[30][31] James Poniewozik of TIME called the season three premiere breathtaking and praised Sagals performance with Holbrook.[32] He later stated that Abel's disappearance helped return the show to its central problem: Jax's allegiance to the club.[33] Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker agreed that Holbrook and Sagals scenes were beautiful and called Stephen Kings portrayal of Bachman chilling. He also commented that the series handled themes of loyalty and family especially well.[34] Maureen Ryan commented that the third season divided critics and fans alike, suggesting the expanded Belfast cast made it harder for the audience to invest in the characters' journeys.[35] Ryan later questioned the credibility of Hector Salazar's story, noting that he was inferior to other villainous characters such as Stahl, Zobelle and Weston. However, she praised Ally Walker's performance, comparing her character to The Shield's Vic Mackey.[36] Critic Alan Sepinwall said the season was "interesting but uneven", noting that the plot gained traction in later episodes.[37][38] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said "Sutter should be applauded for shaking things up", calling the slower pace a "creative necessity".[39]Alan Sepinwall stated that the fourth season risked predictability by returning to a successful formula of storytelling, but he nonetheless preferred those episodes to those of season three.[40] Maureen Ryan reviewed the fourth season positively. She praised the addition of Lincoln Potter (played by Ray McKinnon), comparing the character's quality to that of Breaking Bad's antagonist, Gustavo Fring.[41] The AV Club called the fourth season more "focused" and "operatic". AV Club reviewer Zack Handlen was fond of the season but felt disappointed with the finale, saying it featured a "lousy case of dictated convenience, of an arbitrary and unbelievable reveal used to shift characters around to where the writers want them to be for next season, as opposed to where they might land organically." However, the review did praise Charlie Hunnam's performance in the finale.[42][43] TIME said the fourth season was the strongest since season two, but the show needed to end sooner rather than later. TIME also agreed that the finale's contrivances were sometimes too visible, stating "its the principle: you can only turn up alive at your own funeral so many times before it starts to lose its impact."[44]Sons of Anarchy was nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Drama at the 2010 TCA Awards. Katey Sagal received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress  Television Series (Drama) at the 68th Golden Globe Awards for her role in the third season.

Produced and hosted by its namesake, Oprah Winfrey, it remains the highest-rated talk show in American television history.[2]The show was highly influential, and many of its topics penetrated into the American pop-cultural consciousness. Winfrey used the show as a platform to teach and inspire, providing viewers with a positive, spiritually uplifting experience by featuring book clubs, compelling interviews, self-improvement segments, and philanthropic forays into world events. The show gained credibility by not trying to profit off the products it endorsed; it had no licensing agreement with retailers when products were promoted, nor did the show make any money from endorsing books for its book club.[3]Oprah is one of the longest-running daytime television talk shows in history. The show received 47 Daytime Emmy Awards before Winfrey decided to stop submitting it for consideration in 2000.[4]The show has its roots in A.M. Chicago, a half-hour morning talk show airing on WLS-TV in Chicago, Illinois. Winfrey took over as host on January 2, 1984 and, within a month, took it from last place to first place in the ratings.[5] On September 8, 1986, it was relaunched under its current title and picked up nationally.[6] For the premiere, the show's producers tried rigorously to book Miami Vice's Don Johnson as the first guest, even trying to bribe him with Dom Prignon and a pair of rhinestone sunglasses. All attempts to book Johnson failed and Winfrey decided to "do what we do best, and that is a show about and with everyday people." The topic for the premiere show was "How to Marry the Man or Woman of Your Choice."[7]Early in the 12th season of The Oprah Winfrey Show, Winfrey confessed she was "exhausted" and considered quitting.[8] While making the movie Beloved, Winfrey then admitted that it brought her back to her responsibility as an admired black woman with a great deal of power and influence. She realized that being in such a position within the media industry, she could make a positive difference in people's lives. Winfrey was once again inspired to continue to help people take better control of their destinies, hence her slogan, "Live Your Best Life".I made the decisionin the midst of doing Beloved. I was doing some scenesBeloved is about an ex-slave, and during that process of doing that I connected to really what slavery had meant, and my own personal ancestry and history connected it to a way I have never before from reading all about Black history and, you know, talking to relatives. And I realized that I had no right to quit coming from a history of people who had no voice, who had no power, and that I have been given thisthis blessed opportunity to speak to people, to influence them in ways that can make a difference in their lives, and to just use that.[8]The show was renewed through 2011, but in a 2008 interview with Larry King, Winfrey announced that in 2011, she would not renew her contract, thus ending the show.[9]Winfrey interviewed a plethora of public figures and everyday people during the show's 25-year history. When celebrities and newsmakers were ready to share their most intimate secrets their first stop was Winfrey's couch and when a serious story hit, the Oprah show focused on putting a human face on the headlines.Winfrey claims her worst interviewing experience was with Elizabeth Taylor in the show's second season. Just before the interview, Taylor asked Winfrey not to ask any questions about her relationships. Winfrey found this to be a challenge considering Taylor had been married seven times. Taylor returned to the show in 1992, apologized to Winfrey and told her that she was in excruciating back and hip pain at the time.[10]On February 10, 1993, Winfrey sat down with Michael Jackson for what would become the most-watched interview in television history. Jackson, an intensely private entertainer, hadn't given an interview in 14 years. The event was broadcasted live from Jackson's Neverland Ranch and was watched by 90 million people worldwide. Jackson discussed missing out on a normal childhood and his strained relationship with his father, Joe Jackson. During the interview, Jackson attempted to dispel many of the rumors surrounding him and told Winfrey he suffered from the skin-pigment disorder known as vitiligo when asked about the change in the color of his skin. While admitting to getting a nose job, he denied all other plastic surgery rumors. Later in the interview, Jackson was joined by his close friend Elizabeth Taylor, her third appearance on the show.[11]Winfrey's interview with Tom Cruise, which was broadcast on May 23, 2005, also gained notoriety. Cruiseaccording to The New York Times"jumped around the set, hopped onto a couch, fell rapturously to one knee and repeatedly professed his love for his new girlfriend, Katie Holmes." This scene quickly became part of American pop-cultural discourse and was heavily parodied in media as diverse as MADtv, The Simpsons, Saturday Night Live, Family Guy, Hannah Montana, South Park, That's So Raven, All That, Drake and Josh, Scrubs and the film Scary Movie 4.Singer Celine Dion appeared on the show 28 times, the most of any celebrity, besides Gayle King, Winfrey's best friend, who has appeared 141 times.[12]Winfrey interviewed Kathy Bray three weeks after her 10-year-old son, Scott, was accidentally killed by a friend who'd found his dad's gun. On the 1989 show, Bray said she missed her son's "little dirty dog smell." Winfrey said "Kathy symbolizes every parent who loses a child unexpectedly. Her rawness connected to every mother who has ever lost a little boy with that 'dirty dog smell.' The show changed the way people felt about having guns in their homes."[13]In the fourth season Truddi Chase, a woman who was diagnosed with multiple personality disorder, having 92 distinct personalities, appeared on the show. Chase had been violently and sexually abused beginning at the age of two and said her old self ceased to exist after that. After introducing Chase, who was there to promote her book When Rabbit Howls, Winfrey unexpectedly broke down in tears while reading the teleprompter, relating her own childhood molestation to that of the guest. Unable to control herself, Winfrey repeatedly asked producers to stop filming.[14]Erin Kramp, a mother dying of breast cancer, came on the show in 1998. After realizing that her six-year-old daughter, Peyton, would have to grow up without her, Kramp began recording videotapes filled with motherly advice on everything from makeup tips to finding a husband. She also wrote letters and bought gifts for Peyton to open every Christmas and birthday she was gone. Kramp lost her battle with cancer on October 31, 1998. She had recorded over a hundred video and audiotapes for her daughter.[15]Jo Ann Compton's daughter Laurie Ann was stabbed to death in 1988and a decade later, the mom was tangled in her grief. "I hope they're in the same hell I'm in," she said of her daughter's murderers on a 1998 show. Dr. Phil asked her if she thought her daughter would want her to be in so much painand Compton said no. "Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life," Phil continued. "She lived for 18 vibrant years, and you focus on the day she died." After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: "I never thought of it that way." Later, she sobbed while revealing that she had been planning to end her life after the show. When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: "She continues to stay alive every time I do something positive." Compton's surviving daughter, Cindy, said "She went from existing to living. It was an amazing transformation."[16]In 2001, Winfrey met poet and peacemaker 11-year-old Mattie Stepanek, who was born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy. Despite his disease, Stepanek had an incredibly positive attitude. He used his gift of insight to write poetry he called "heartsongs" and spread his message of peace through the world. On the show, Stepanek spoke of "heartsongs":Originally featured a monthly book highlight, including author interviews. Its popularity caused featured books to shoot to the top of bestseller lists, often increasing sales by as many as a million copies at its peak. It was suspended in 2002 and returned in 2003, featuring more classic works of literature, with reduced selections per season. The original format was reintroduced in September 2005, but Winfrey's selection of James Frey's A Million Little Pieces became controversial due to accusations of falsification. January 2006 saw Elie Wiesel's Night selected; Winfrey even traveled to Auschwitz with Wiesel. In 2008, Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth was selected. Modernizing the book club's platform, Winfrey and Tolle began a series of live webcast classes that were streamed on Oprah.com to discuss elements of the book with a worldwide audience.[18]Items personally favored by Winfrey were featured on the show and given away to audience members. Since it's launch in 1996, the "Favorite Things" episode quickly became the hottest ticket in television. When a product was featured, it's sales skyrocketed. Select groups were sometimes chosen to receive the items. In 2004, the audience was made up of educators from across the country. Hurricane Katrina volunteer workers were invited to the 2005 show. Winfrey has said that the iPad, given away to her 2010 audience, was her all-time favorite "Favorite Thing". During a Season 25: Oprah Behind the Scenes episode documenting the production of the giveaway, Winfrey talked about why the event resonates with viewers:Winfrey and Gayle King have one of the most iconic friendships in pop-culture history. In 1976, Winfrey was working as a news anchor in Baltimore when she met King, a production assistant. The two bonded during a snowstorm when Winfrey told King she could stay at her home to wait it out. Their friendship was often showcased on the show when the best friends decided to take a trip together.In 2004, they traveled back in time, participating in the PBS series Colonial House. The series intended to recreate daily life in Plymouth Colony in 1628. Their 24-hour Puritan adventure included wood chopping, cooking over an open fire, battling with mice, and using leaves for toilet paper.[20]Winfrey and King joined 60 women for a spa getaway in 2006. They spent five days at Miraval Life in Balance Resort and Spa taking part in self-improvement exercises. For an exercise called A Swing and a Prayer, the women were hoisted 40 feet in the air and told to let go. Once in the air, Kingwho is afraid of heightswouldn't let herself fall. Winfrey couldn't help but laugh as King remained in the air but eventually persuaded her to let go.[21]In the summer of 2006, Winfrey and King decided to go on an 11-day road trip across America, from California to New York, 3,600 miles. They were excited to meet people from small towns and see how America really lives. However, the initial excitement quickly wore off. The friends had minor meltdowns and fought for control over the radio; King likes to have music constantly playing while driving, Winfrey prefers silence. Despite the challenges of the road trip, they got to see the beauty of Sedona, meet the people of Navajo Nation, crash a couple of weddings, take a dip in the healing waters of Pagosa Springs, and learn about Amish culture. Winfrey's many driving anxieties and King's tone-deaf singing made the trip a huge hit with viewers.[22]The friends visited the State Fair of Texas in 2009. They played traditional state fair games like Flip-the-Chick and the water gun race. They tried many of the fried foods offered at the fair and judged a best "Best of Show" food contest.[23]For the farewell season, the best friends hit the road again for an overnight camping trip at Yosemite National Park. Park ranger Shelton Johnson wrote to Winfrey because he was concerned by the low number of African-Americans who visited the national parks each year. So Winfrey and King packed up their camper and headed to Yosemite to help Johnson attract visitors. When they arrived, Johnson took Winfrey and King around the park to see some of its famous sites including Mariposa Grove and the Tunnel View, where El Capitan is visible in the distance. On the way to the campsite, Winfrey made a sharp turn causing their trailer to hit a rock. After setting up their pop-up camper, the two mixed up some Moscow Mules to pass out to their camping neighbors. The drink has become a signature Oprah cocktail. The next day they took a lesson in fly fishing and wrapped up their stay with a mule ride.[24]A segment at the end of the show that featured spiritual counselors, ordinary people who had been involved in extraordinary situations. They would come on the show and share their stories of overcoming adversity with the audience, inspiring viewers to do the same in their own life.[25]Iyanla Vanzant is a spiritual teacher and self-help expert who was a regular on the show in the late 1990s. She started the show in its 12th season and became known for her no-nonsense, hard-hitting, and often humorous advice. Vanzant's take on everything from cheating spouses to financial struggles connected with viewers and, at times, Winfrey sat in the audience while Vanzant led the show. Her books In the Meantime and One Day My Soul Just Opened Up became New York Times bestsellers.[26]Winfrey met Dr. Phil McGraw when he worked as a consultant for her legal team during her 1998 beef trial in Texas. Starting April that year, he became a fixture on the show and a viewer favorite. McGraw gave guests tough, tell-it-like-it-is advice and didn't allow excuses or rationalizations for their bad habits, bad marriages, or bad attitudes. His popular Tuesday appearances on the show led to his own talk show, Dr. Phil, in 2002.[27]Financial expert Suze Orman became a viewer favorite, offering money tips, spending interventions, and her famous "Suze smackdowns." She encouraged people to be honest with themselves about what they could afford and gave advice on getting rid of credit card debt. Her motivational approach to fixing finances has led to her own financial advice empire.[28]Winfrey introduced up-and-coming public figures who generated industry buzz but not otherwise widely known. In what several media commentators have labelled The Oprah Effect, people appearing on this segment such as Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx and singer James Blunt benefited from the extra publicity the show garnered. Blunt in particular saw album sales increase dramatically and landed a Top Two spot on the Billboard 200.A show feature called "Wildest Dreams" fulfilled the dreams of people reported to Winfrey by the producers  mostly viewers who wrote in to the show  be the dreams of a new house, an encounter with a favorite performer, or a guest role on a popular TV show.Mehmet Oz, the Ivy-League educated head of cardiac surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in NYC and better known to millions of Winfrey's viewers as "Dr. Oz", regularly appeared on Tuesdays during the 20082009 season. In 2009, Dr. Oz debuted The Dr. Oz Show in first-run syndication. The series is co-produced by Harpo Productions and Sony Pictures Television. Dr. Oz has been criticized as promoting pseudo-science, and was the 2009 winner of the Pigasus Award [1].A weekly live episode premiered in the show's 23rd season with a panel consisting of Winfrey, Gayle King, Mark Consuelos, and Ali Wentworth. The panel discussed the week's news and highlighted events in the media and on the show.In the 200910 season, Winfrey hosted this segment on her own. Fridays Live did not return for the show's 25th season.[29]In March 2010, Winfrey began a campaign to stop drivers from talking or texting on their cell phone in their vehicles while driving. This campaign was regularly noted near the beginning or at the end of episodes.[30]On November 10, 1986, during a show about sexual abuse, Winfrey revealed that she was raped when she was nine years old by a relative. Since this episode, Winfrey has used the show as a platform to help catch child predators, raise awareness, and give victims a voice.[31]Liberace appeared in the first season of the show on December 25, 1986. He performed a Christmas medley; Winfrey said it was "the most beautiful I've ever heard". Six weeks later he died of cardiac arrest due to congestive heart failure brought on by subacute encephalopathy. The episode was Liberace's final televised appearance.[32]The show had only been on air for just six months when, in 1987, Winfrey traveled to Forsyth County, a community in which, for 75 years, no black person had lived. Winfrey brought attention to racial tensions in the area. The show was set up as a town hall meeting where residents expressed their divisive opinions on the matter. The meeting was becoming heated when one woman stood up and said:The "Diet Dreams Come True" episode from November 15, 1988 has become one of the most talked-about moments in the history of show. After years of struggling to lose weight, Winfrey had finally succeeded in doing so. In July of that year, she had started the Optifast diet while weighing 212 pounds. By Fall, she weighed 145 pounds. To commemorate achieving her weight loss goals, Winfrey wheeled out a wagon full of fat to represent the 67 pounds she had lost on the diet. She showed off her slim figure in a pair of size 10 Calvin Klein jeans. However, after returning to real food she quickly gained back much of the weight she had lost.[34] Winfrey now refers to that moment as her "ego in a pom pom salute."[35]While doing a show centered on women drug users in 1995, Winfrey opened up about her personal history with drug abuse:In 1996, Winfrey spoke with seven of the Little Rock Nine and three white former classmates who tormented the group on their first day of high school in 1957 as well as a student who had befriended them. Winfrey was grateful to have the remaining members of the Little Rock Nine on her show because she credits her success to those who have contributed to the Civil Rights Movement which paved the way for people like herself.[37]Comedian Ellen DeGeneres came out publicly as a lesbian during her appearance on the show in 1997 after appearing on a Time magazine cover next to the headline "Yep, I'm gay." Back then, DeGeneres was the star of her own sitcom, ABC's Ellen. At the time, the episode brought Winfrey the most hate mail she had ever received.[38]Clemantine Wamariya and her sister Claire appeared on the show in 2006 when Wamariya was selected as one of the winners of an essay contest held by Winfrey. It was revealed that the siblings had not seen their parents in 12 years after fleeing Rwanda during the 1994 genocide. Winfrey surprised the sisters by flying their family to Chicago for one of the most emotional reunions on the show.[39]In 2007, the Marines of the Second Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion Alpha Company and their naval corpsman, made the show their first stop after a seven-month tour on the front lines in Iraq. Winfrey welcomed the Marines with a big homecoming celebration where they were reunited with their loved ones on the show.[40]On November 11, 2009, Charla Nash, who was mauled by her friend and employer Sandra Herold's pet chimpanzee Travis, came to the show to speak out for the first time about the terrifying attack that took place just nine months prior. Nash wears a veil daily because the attack left devastating injuries to her face and she "doesn't want to scare people." During the show, she agreed to lift her veil for the first time in public.[41]While taping the show's 24th season premiere on September 8, 2009, the entire audience of 21,000 people, gathered on Chicago's Magnificent Mile, surprised Winfrey by breaking out into a synchronized dance set to The Black Eyed Peas' performance of "I Gotta Feeling" (with new lyrics congratulating Winfrey on her show's longevity). The dance had been choreographed and rehearsed for weeks by a core group of dancers, who taught it to the entire crowd earlier in the day.[42]During the farewell season, two hundred men who were molested came forward as part of a two-day event in 2010 to take a stand against sexual abuse. The men were joined by director and producer Tyler Perry, who had also experienced sexual abuse. Winfrey hoped that the episode would help survivors suffering in silence release the shame.[43]On January 24, 2011, Winfrey revealed that just before Thanksgiving she had discovered she has a half-sister. Winfrey decided to share the news on her show because she knew the story would eventually get out and wanted to be the first to address the matter.[44]On the season premiere of 2004, every person in Winfrey's show audience was given a new car (donated by General Motors). For the premiere of the show's farewell season, the studio audience of 300 "ultimate fans" were rewarded by being given a trip to Australia with Winfrey (donated by Australian tourism bodies).[45] Other giveaway shows included the annual Oprah's favorite things show, where the studio audience received products Winfrey considered good Christmas gifts.In the late 1990s, on a discussion of mad cow disease, Winfrey stated that the disease fears had "stopped me cold from eating another burger!" Texas cattle ranchers considered that quote tantamount to defamation, and promptly sued her for libel. The show was still producing new episodes at the time of the trial and could not go into reruns, so the production was forced to move to Amarillo, Texas for a period of approximately one month during the proceedings. A gag order meant Winfrey was not allowed to even mention the trial on her show. Winfrey was found not liable.[46][47][48][49] The trial and move to Amarillo led to Winfrey meeting Phil McGraw; Winfrey made McGraw a regular guest on her show shortly thereafter, which eventually led to McGraw getting his own show, produced by Winfrey's Harpo Productions.[50]A controversial episode, which aired in 2005 (though originally aired to little apparent notice in October 2003), saw guests discussing the sexual act of "rimming", igniting criticism. The FCC received a proliferation of complaints from angry parents whose children watched the show in an early-evening slot in many television markets. However, most FCC correspondents were prodded to write by Howard Stern, a noteworthy target of the agency, as well as Jimmy Kimmel, in an attempt to expose an FCC double standard.[51][52]During the 2008 presidential election campaign, Winfrey was criticized for apparently declining to invite Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to her show until after the election.[53]A 2009 episode attracted criticism from the crowd after Winfrey suggested mothers should buy vibrators for their teenage daughters.[54]Winfrey's program was criticized for featuring alternative medicine advocates such as Suzanne Somers and vaccine denialist Jenny McCarthy.[55][56]In the lead-up to Winfrey's tour of Australia, the show was heavily criticized for airing a segment sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation[57][58] in which it was claimed by Australian TV personality Carrie Bickmore that Australians liked to hang out at "hip McCafs".[59] This depiction of Australian culture was greeted with surprise by many Australians,[57] and anger throughout the Australian coffee industry, which claimed the statements did not accurately reflect the industry, painted the Australian coffee drinker in a bad light, and expected that the industry would be negatively affected by the statements.[58] In the same episode, McDonald's products were handed out to the studio audience.On November 20, 2009, Winfrey announced that the 25th season would be the show's last. She said during the live Friday episode:Monday, September 13, 2010 was the season premiere of The Oprah Winfrey Show's final season. Winfrey opened the show with guest John Travolta and announced that the 300 guests in the audience were her most loyal fans and ultimate viewers of the show, who had expressed their admiration of the show through the show's website and through emails. Those 300 people were invited there specifically for the premiere show. She said that Travolta was voted the most favorite guest.The 25th season premiere included flashbacks from the last 25 years, and included various audience members and their experiences watching the show. There was also a segment on how they chose some of the 300 people who were in the audience. Don Johnson and Paul Simon also made special guest appearances on the premiere show.At the end of the show, Winfrey announced that she was flying all 300 audience members with her to Australia and that John Travolta would be the pilot.[61] On December 11, 2010 Winfrey arrived in Sydney, Australia to record shows at the Sydney Opera House. Winfrey and her 300 American audience members were officially welcomed at a cocktail party in Sydney's Botanical Gardens overlooking Sydney Harbour.[62] The beach-themed party, hosted by New South Wales Premier Kristina Keneally, featured live music from top recording artist Guy Sebastian and a fireworks display over the water which culminated in the lighting of a red 'O' on the Harbour Bridge.[63]The episodes in Australia were coordinated between Harpo Studios, Tourism Australia, Tourism New South Wales, the Sydney Opera House, Tourism Victoria, Tourism Queensland, R.M. Williams and Network 10.[64][65] The federal government of Australia spent $1.5 million on the event while the government of the state of New South Wales spent an additional $12 million to promote the region. Tourism minister Martin Ferguson said "I think it's money well spent".[64][65] Also a further A$650,000 just by Tourism Victoria alone.[66]The farewell season featured several notable cast reunions including The Sound of Music, The Color Purple, and The Way We Were.[67][68][69]While Winfrey was in the midst of ending her celebrated talk show, she managed to launch her cable network, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, in conjunction with Discovery Communications[70]On April 14, 2011, the show began a 30-day countdown to the finale. The countdown displayed the number of shows left at the beginning of every episode and concluded each episode with notable pop-culture figures thanking Winfrey for her contribution to the world and wishing her luck on all future endeavors. The countdown also featured exclusive videos from Winfrey on Oprah.com recorded after every show in which she expressed how she felt the taping that day went.[71]In May 2011, Winfrey interviewed U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, her first-ever interview with a sitting president and First Lady. They talked about the challenges of parenting at the White House, the strength of their relationship, and their concern for the country's future. President Obama also thanked Winfrey for her contributions to the country. "You've got a big heart, and you share it with people. Nobody knows how to connect better than you do," he said. "We are just blessed and grateful to have you in our lives."[72]The final episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show aired in the United States on Wednesday, May 25, 2011. It was preceded by a two-part farewell special recorded at the United Center in Chicago in front of an audience of 13,000.[73] The two-part show featured appearances by Aretha Franklin, Tom Cruise, Stevie Wonder,Patti LaBelle,Beyonc, Tom Hanks, Maria Shriver, Will Smith, and Madonna.[74][75][76] The final episode was a smaller affair, recorded in the usual recording studio. [77] Winfrey spent most of the finale thanking the show's staff and her fans.I've been asked many times during this farewell season, 'Is ending the show bittersweet?' Well, I say all sweet. No bitter. And here is why: Many of us have been together for 25 years. We have hooted and hollered together, had our aha! moments, we ugly-cried together and we did our gratitude journals.

It was modelled after the American drama of the same name.In 1972 ITV started to broadcast programmes on weekday afternoons triggering a new wave of productions to fill out the extended schedules. Among the first of these shows, which were aimed at giving advertisers access to 'stay at home mums' and housewives in general, were the long-running rural soap Emmerdale Farm (YTV) and the twice-weekly medical drama General Hospital.Set in a fictional Midlands town, the series followed the romantic and professional lives of its doctors and nurses. While the location and the characters names had been changed, in most other respects General Hospital was almost identical to its predecessor, Emergency - Ward 10, a deliberate attempt to recreate its success.In 1975, after 110 twice-weekly episodes, General Hospital was given a primetime slot on Friday evening. The move saw the episode lengths double from 30 to 60 minutes, with each episode being more self-contained, while on-screen medical procedures, including detailed scenes of surgery, became more prominent.The main star of the series was actor Tony Adams who played Doctor Neville Bywaters; he later went on to appear as Adam Chance in Crossroads (19641988, 2001). Among the other familiar faces to appear was Lynda Bellingham, who gained national fame as the mother in a series of commercials for Oxo stock cubes, and later as Helen Herriot in the series All Creatures Great and Small, based on the books by James Herriot. Other notable regulars included Carmen Munroe, who was also a regular presenter in the Play School children's programme team;and a young, Sally Knyvette, who went on to appear in Blakes 7 and Emmerdale Farm.By 1979 the "homely" feel of General Hospital was considered to be old-fashioned, in the wake of newer grittier dramas, and it was cancelled. Many episodes are still missing from television archives.Tom Adams as Dr Guy WallmanTony Adams as Dr Neville BywatersLynda Bellingham as Nurse Hilda PriceVictoria Burton as Staff Nurse NelsonJudy Buxton as Nurse Katy ShawDavid Garth as Mr Matthew ArmstrongMonica Grey as Sister EdwardsJohn Halstead as Arnold CapperLewis Jones as Mr William Parker-BrownJames Kerry as Dr Martin BaxterEric Lander as Dr Richard KirbyRonald Leigh-Hunt as Dr Robert ThorneJudy Loe as Dr Helen SandersPatricia Maynard as Dr Joanna WhitworthCarmen Munroe as Sister WashingtonCarl Rigg as Dr KnightJason Rose as Dr ChipapoPippa Rowe as Sister HollandPeggy Sinclair as Sister Helen ChapmanArchie Tew as Dr MayhewAmber Thomas as Nurse StevensJenny Twigge as Dr. Cathy WaddonIan White as Dr Peter RidgeRosemary Frankau as Staff Nurse Lyn DawsonGeneral Hospital at the BFI's ScreenonlineThis is an episode listing for the comedy drama TV series Ugly Betty.

The change resulted in a number of continuity problems, which were "fixed" by making most of the episode a flashback and adding scenes with Betty telling Christina the bulk of the story. In Italy, Denmark, Spain, India and the Philippines, the episode is retained as the 4th episode.[1]On the season 1 DVD box set, "Swag" is listed as episode 4, without the scenes of Betty talking to Christina in a flashback. Other noticeable changes on the DVD were the reversed order of the show's episode chronology: "The Box and the Bunny", which is the second episode, is listed as the third episode, having swapped places with "Queens for a Day". However, "The Box and the Bunny" should be the second episode.Season 2 was originally slated to have a total of 24 episodes, but due to the Writers Guild of America strike, it had 18 episodes with the last five written and produced following the strike's end.Note: ABC placed Ugly Betty on a temporary hiatus after the March 19, 2009 episode to air Samantha Who? and In the Motherhood in the 8-9PM E/P slot, but returned it after the shows complete their runs.[4] Ugly Betty returned on April 30, 2009 to finish its 3rd season, ending with a 2-hour season finale airing on May 21, 2009.[5]Note: Episodes 6674 all aired on Fridays (October 16  December 11, 2009); Episodes 7585 aired on Wednesdays (January 6, 2010  April 14, 2010).Note: Season 4 was originally slated to have a total of 22 episodes but was reduced to 20 episodes.
